module TopModule (
    input logic clk,    // 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered
    input logic a,      // 1-bit data input
    output logic q      // 1-bit output, state of the circuit
);

// The module is a sequential circuit that toggles the output `q` based on the input `a`,
// but only when the clock signal `clk` has a rising edge. The following describes the behavior:

// **Initial State**: 
// At simulation start or power-up, the state of `q` is initialized to 0.

// **Behavior**: 
// - On the rising edge of `clk`:
//   - If `a` is 0, keep `q` unchanged.
//   - If `a` is 1, toggle the state of `q` (i.e., if `q` was 1, it becomes 0 and vice versa).

// **Reset Behavior**: 
// No reset signal is specified; thus, the circuit does not include any reset logic.

// **Assumptions**: 
// - The input `a` is stable around the clock edge (setup and hold times are met).
// - The initial value of `q` is explicitly set to 0 for simulation and synthesis purposes.

    q = 1'b0; // Initialize q to 0 to avoid undefined states

    end
    // If a == 0, q remains unchanged
