Once the sequence is detected, the `start_shifting` output is set to `1` and remains `1` until the module is reset. The FSM transitions through states based on the input `data` and is synchronized to the positive edge of the `clk`. The `reset` is active high and synchronous, meaning it will only reset the FSM on the next clock edge when `reset` is high."

Once the sequence is detected, the `start_shifting` output is set to `1` and remains `1` until the module is reset. The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning it will only take effect on the rising edge of the clock when `reset` is high."
