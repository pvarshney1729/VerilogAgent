All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  ena\n - output pm\n - output hh (8 bits)\n - output mm (8 bits)\n - output ss (8 bits)\n\nCreate a set of counters suitable for use as a 12-hour clock (with am/pm\nindicator). Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse\non ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second, while\n\"clk\" is much faster than once per second). The signal \"pm\" is asserted\nif the clock is PM, or is otherwise AM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD\n(Binary- Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59),\nand seconds (00-59). Reset is the active high synchronous signal that\nresets the clock to \"12:00 AM.\" Reset has higher priority than enable and\ncan occur even when not enabled. Assume all sequential logic is triggered\non the positive edge of the clock.\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "
