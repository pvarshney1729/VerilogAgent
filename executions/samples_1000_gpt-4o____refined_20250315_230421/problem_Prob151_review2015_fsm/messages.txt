All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  data\n - input  done_counting\n - input  ack\n - output shift_ena\n - output counting\n - output done\n\nThe module should implement a timer that:\n\n  (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,\n  (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n  (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n  (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n\nIn this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls\nthe timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included\nhere.\n\nThe serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101\nis received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for\nexactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its\ncounting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits\nuntil input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must\nassert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until\ninput ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the\nstart sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high\nsynchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the\ninput sequence 1101. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the\npositive edge of the clock.\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "

The FSM transitions through states to detect the pattern `1101`, shifts in 4 bits, waits for counting to complete, and then signals completion. It uses a synchronous reset to return to the initial state."
