All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk,\n - input  load,\n - input  data (512 bits)\n - output q    (512 bits)\n\nThe module should implement Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton\nwith interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a\none-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next\nstate of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n\n  Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n  1    | 1      | 1     | 0\n  1    | 1      | 0     | 1\n  1    | 0      | 1     | 0\n  1    | 0      | 0     | 1\n  0    | 1      | 1     | 1\n  0    | 1      | 0     | 0\n  0    | 0      | 1     | 1\n  0    | 0      | 0     | 0\n\nIn this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one\ntime step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the\nsystem should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1]\nand q[512]) are both zero (off). Assume all sequential logic is triggered\non the positive edge of the clock.\n\n"
