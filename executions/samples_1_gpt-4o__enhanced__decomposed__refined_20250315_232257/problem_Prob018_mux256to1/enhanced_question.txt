Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The module implements a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. It takes a 256-bit input vector and an 8-bit selection signal to output a single bit corresponding to the selected input.

Port Definitions:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [255:0] in`: A 256-bit input vector. Each bit `in[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 255) represents a separate 1-bit input to the multiplexer.
  - `input [7:0] sel`: An 8-bit selection signal. This signal determines which bit from the `in` vector is routed to the output. The selection is based on the binary value of `sel`.

- Output Ports:
  - `output out`: A 1-bit output that represents the selected bit from the `in` input vector.

Functional Details:
- The module acts as a multiplexer where the `sel` signal determines which bit from the `in` vector is passed to the `out` port.
- The selection process follows this mapping: `sel = 0` selects `in[0]`, `sel = 1` selects `in[1]`, ..., `sel = 255` selects `in[255]`.
- The module is purely combinational, meaning there are no sequential logic elements or clock dependencies within this module.
- There are no reset conditions as the design does not incorporate any state-holding elements.

Additional Considerations:
- Ensure that the input `sel` is always within the range of 0 to 255 to avoid undefined behavior. The behavior for `sel` values outside this range is not specified.

Edge Cases:
- The design assumes `sel` is always correctly constrained to valid values (0-255). Handling out-of-bound values for `sel` should be managed by upstream logic if necessary.
