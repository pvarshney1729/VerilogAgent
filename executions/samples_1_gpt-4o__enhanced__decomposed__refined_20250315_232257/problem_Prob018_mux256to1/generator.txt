<REASONING>
The task is to implement a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog. The module named `TopModule` has a 256-bit input vector `in`, an 8-bit selection input `sel`, and a 1-bit output `out`. The `sel` input determines which bit from the `in` vector is routed to the `out` output. Since the selection is purely combinational, we use an `assign` statement to directly map the selected bit to the output. This approach adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring that the implementation is efficient and straightforward.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [255:0] in,
    input  logic [7:0]   sel,
    output logic         out
);

    // Combinational logic to select the appropriate bit based on 'sel'
    assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
[DONE]
