Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe module implements a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. It takes a 256-bit input vector and an 8-bit selection signal to output a single bit corresponding to the selected input.\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input [255:0] in`: A 256-bit input vector. Each bit `in[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 255) represents a separate 1-bit input to the multiplexer.\n  - `input [7:0] sel`: An 8-bit selection signal. This signal determines which bit from the `in` vector is routed to the output. The selection is based on the binary value of `sel`.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output out`: A 1-bit output that represents the selected bit from the `in` input vector.\n\nFunctional Details:\n- The module acts as a multiplexer where the `sel` signal determines which bit from the `in` vector is passed to the `out` port.\n- The selection process follows this mapping: `sel = 0` selects `in[0]`, `sel = 1` selects `in[1]`, ..., `sel = 255` selects `in[255]`.\n- The module is purely combinational, meaning there are no sequential logic elements or clock dependencies within this module.\n- There are no reset conditions as the design does not incorporate any state-holding elements.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- Ensure that the input `sel` is always within the range of 0 to 255 to avoid undefined behavior. The behavior for `sel` values outside this range is not specified.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The design assumes `sel` is always correctly constrained to valid values (0-255). Handling out-of-bound values for `sel` should be managed by upstream logic if necessary.\n                    "
