Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk` : Clock signal (positive edge-triggered).
  - `input resetn` : Active-low synchronous reset signal. Maintains the FSM in the initial state when asserted.
  - `input x` : One-bit input signal from the motor.
  - `input y` : One-bit input signal from the motor.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg f` : One-bit control output for the motor.
  - `output reg g` : One-bit control output for the motor.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- Initial State: The FSM begins in State A.
- Reset Behavior: 
  - While `resetn` is asserted (low), the FSM remains in State A.
  - Upon de-assertion of `resetn` (high), at the next positive clock edge, the FSM transitions from State A.
  
- State Transitions and Output Logic:
  1. Upon exiting State A (following the de-assertion of `resetn`), set `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
  2. Monitor `x` in subsequent clock cycles:
     - If `x` follows a pattern of 1, 0, 1 over three successive positive clock edges, set `g` to 1 on the next clock cycle.
  3. Once `g` is set to 1, monitor `y`:
     - If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, maintain `g` as 1 indefinitely (until reset).
     - If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, set `g` back to 0 indefinitely (until reset).

- Output `f` and `g` are updated on the positive edge of `clk`.

- Initial Values:
  - `f` and `g` are initialized to 0 upon reset.

- Clock and Reset:
  - All state transitions and output updates are synchronized with the positive edge of the `clk`.
  - Reset (`resetn`) is synchronous and active-low, meaning it acts on the next positive clock edge when asserted.

- Bit Indexing Convention:
  - All inputs and outputs are treated as single-bit signals.

- Edge Cases:
  - Ensure that the pattern detection for `x` and monitoring of `y` start only after the initial setup of `f` is complete.
  - Handle transitions smoothly to prevent glitches in output signals `f` and `g`.

No race conditions are expected due to positive edge-triggered logic and well-defined state transitions.
