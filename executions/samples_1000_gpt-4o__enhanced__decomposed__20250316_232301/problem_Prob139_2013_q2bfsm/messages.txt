Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk` : Clock signal (positive edge-triggered).\n  - `input resetn` : Active-low synchronous reset signal. Maintains the FSM in the initial state when asserted.\n  - `input x` : One-bit input signal from the motor.\n  - `input y` : One-bit input signal from the motor.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg f` : One-bit control output for the motor.\n  - `output reg g` : One-bit control output for the motor.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- Initial State: The FSM begins in State A.\n- Reset Behavior: \n  - While `resetn` is asserted (low), the FSM remains in State A.\n  - Upon de-assertion of `resetn` (high), at the next positive clock edge, the FSM transitions from State A.\n  \n- State Transitions and Output Logic:\n  1. Upon exiting State A (following the de-assertion of `resetn`), set `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.\n  2. Monitor `x` in subsequent clock cycles:\n     - If `x` follows a pattern of 1, 0, 1 over three successive positive clock edges, set `g` to 1 on the next clock cycle.\n  3. Once `g` is set to 1, monitor `y`:\n     - If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, maintain `g` as 1 indefinitely (until reset).\n     - If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, set `g` back to 0 indefinitely (until reset).\n\n- Output `f` and `g` are updated on the positive edge of `clk`.\n\n- Initial Values:\n  - `f` and `g` are initialized to 0 upon reset.\n\n- Clock and Reset:\n  - All state transitions and output updates are synchronized with the positive edge of the `clk`.\n  - Reset (`resetn`) is synchronous and active-low, meaning it acts on the next positive clock edge when asserted.\n\n- Bit Indexing Convention:\n  - All inputs and outputs are treated as single-bit signals.\n\n- Edge Cases:\n  - Ensure that the pattern detection for `x` and monitoring of `y` start only after the initial setup of `f` is complete.\n  - Handle transitions smoothly to prevent glitches in output signals `f` and `g`.\n\nNo race conditions are expected due to positive edge-triggered logic and well-defined state transitions.\n                    "
