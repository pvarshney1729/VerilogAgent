        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input clk: 1-bit clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- input reset: 1-bit synchronous active high reset signal.\n- input in: 1-bit input signal.\n- output out: 1-bit output signal.\n\nModule Description:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:\n\n1. States:\n   - Four states named A, B, C, and D.\n   - The state machine starts in state A upon reset.\n\n2. Synchronous Reset:\n   - The reset signal is synchronous with the clock.\n   - Active high reset that resets the FSM to state A.\n\n3. State Transitions:\n   - Transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n   - The state transition table is defined as follows:\n\n     - State A:\n       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Remains in A\n       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Transitions to B\n       - Output: 0\n\n     - State B:\n       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Transitions to C\n       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Remains in B\n       - Output: 0\n\n     - State C:\n       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Transitions to A\n       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Transitions to D\n       - Output: 0\n\n     - State D:\n       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Transitions to C\n       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Transitions to B\n       - Output: 1\n\n4. Output Behavior:\n   - The output is determined by the current state only (Moore machine).\n   - Outputs are stable from the start of the clock cycle.\n\n5. Initial Conditions and Edge Cases:\n   - On reset, the FSM is initialized to state A with output 0.\n   - Ensure all sequential elements are initialized correctly to avoid undefined states.\n\n6. Signal Relationships:\n   - All state transitions and outputs are dependent solely on the current state and the input 'in'.\n   - No race conditions are present as transitions are driven by the clock edge.\n\nThe module ensures a clear and deterministic behavior across all defined states and transitions, with explicit handling of the reset condition.\n                    "
