Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input clk: 1-bit clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input reset: 1-bit synchronous active high reset signal.
- input in: 1-bit input signal.
- output out: 1-bit output signal.

Module Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:

1. States:
   - Four states named A, B, C, and D.
   - The state machine starts in state A upon reset.

2. Synchronous Reset:
   - The reset signal is synchronous with the clock.
   - Active high reset that resets the FSM to state A.

3. State Transitions:
   - Transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.
   - The state transition table is defined as follows:

     - State A:
       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Remains in A
       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Transitions to B
       - Output: 0

     - State B:
       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Transitions to C
       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Remains in B
       - Output: 0

     - State C:
       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Transitions to A
       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Transitions to D
       - Output: 0

     - State D:
       - Next state if 'in' = 0: Transitions to C
       - Next state if 'in' = 1: Transitions to B
       - Output: 1

4. Output Behavior:
   - The output is determined by the current state only (Moore machine).
   - Outputs are stable from the start of the clock cycle.

5. Initial Conditions and Edge Cases:
   - On reset, the FSM is initialized to state A with output 0.
   - Ensure all sequential elements are initialized correctly to avoid undefined states.

6. Signal Relationships:
   - All state transitions and outputs are dependent solely on the current state and the input 'in'.
   - No race conditions are present as transitions are driven by the clock edge.

The module ensures a clear and deterministic behavior across all defined states and transitions, with explicit handling of the reset condition.
