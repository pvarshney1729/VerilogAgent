Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for triggering sequential logic (positive edge-triggered).
  - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.
  - `input wire data`: Serial data input for pattern detection and duration determination.
  - `input wire done_counting`: Signal indicating the external counter has completed its count.
  - `input wire ack`: Acknowledgment signal from the user.

- Outputs:
  - `output reg shift_ena`: Indicates that the module should shift in bits for delay duration. Active for 4 clock cycles.
  - `output reg counting`: Indicates the state machine is in the counting phase, waiting for `done_counting` to be high.
  - `output reg done`: Indicates the timer has completed and is waiting for user acknowledgment.

Sequential Logic and State Machine Specification:
1. Initial State and Reset Behavior:
   - Upon an active-high synchronous reset, the state machine initializes to the state where it searches for the input pattern `1101`.
   - All output signals (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) should be reset to `0`.

2. Pattern Detection:
   - The state machine continuously monitors the `data` input for the occurrence of the bit pattern `1101`.
   - Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit.

3. Shifting Duration Bits:
   - Once the pattern `1101` is detected, the state machine asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles.
   - During these cycles, the module shifts in additional bits from the `data` input to determine the delay duration.

4. Counting Phase:
   - After shifting in the duration bits, the state machine transitions to the counting phase, asserting `counting`.
   - It remains in this state until `done_counting` is asserted high, indicating the count completion.

5. Notification and Acknowledgment:
   - Upon `done_counting` being high, the state machine asserts `done`, signaling the user that the timer has expired.
   - The state remains in this phase until `ack` is asserted high, indicating user acknowledgment.
   - Once acknowledged, the state machine resets to search for the next occurrence of the `1101` pattern.

Edge Cases and Clarifications:
- The state machine assumes all inputs are stable throughout a single clock cycle.
- The transition between states occurs on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- Ensure no race conditions exist by defining explicit transitions between states based on input signals.
