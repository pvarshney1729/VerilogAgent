Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for triggering sequential logic (positive edge-triggered).\n  - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n  - `input wire data`: Serial data input for pattern detection and duration determination.\n  - `input wire done_counting`: Signal indicating the external counter has completed its count.\n  - `input wire ack`: Acknowledgment signal from the user.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output reg shift_ena`: Indicates that the module should shift in bits for delay duration. Active for 4 clock cycles.\n  - `output reg counting`: Indicates the state machine is in the counting phase, waiting for `done_counting` to be high.\n  - `output reg done`: Indicates the timer has completed and is waiting for user acknowledgment.\n\nSequential Logic and State Machine Specification:\n1. Initial State and Reset Behavior:\n   - Upon an active-high synchronous reset, the state machine initializes to the state where it searches for the input pattern `1101`.\n   - All output signals (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) should be reset to `0`.\n\n2. Pattern Detection:\n   - The state machine continuously monitors the `data` input for the occurrence of the bit pattern `1101`.\n   - Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit.\n\n3. Shifting Duration Bits:\n   - Once the pattern `1101` is detected, the state machine asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles.\n   - During these cycles, the module shifts in additional bits from the `data` input to determine the delay duration.\n\n4. Counting Phase:\n   - After shifting in the duration bits, the state machine transitions to the counting phase, asserting `counting`.\n   - It remains in this state until `done_counting` is asserted high, indicating the count completion.\n\n5. Notification and Acknowledgment:\n   - Upon `done_counting` being high, the state machine asserts `done`, signaling the user that the timer has expired.\n   - The state remains in this phase until `ack` is asserted high, indicating user acknowledgment.\n   - Once acknowledged, the state machine resets to search for the next occurrence of the `1101` pattern.\n\nEdge Cases and Clarifications:\n- The state machine assumes all inputs are stable throughout a single clock cycle.\n- The transition between states occurs on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- Ensure no race conditions exist by defining explicit transitions between states based on input signals.\n                    "
