Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: `in` (1 bit) - This is the primary input signal for the state machine.\n- Input: `state` (4 bits) - This represents the current state of the state machine using one-hot encoding.\n- Output: `next_state` (4 bits) - This represents the next state of the state machine using one-hot encoding.\n- Output: `out` (1 bit) - This is the output of the state machine based on the current state.\n\nState Encoding:\n- The state machine uses one-hot encoding for state representation, with the following mappings:\n  - State A: 4'b0001\n  - State B: 4'b0010\n  - State C: 4'b0100\n  - State D: 4'b1000\n\nState Transition Table:\n- Current State | `in` = 0 | `in` = 1 | Output\n  - A | Next State: A | Next State: B | Output: 0\n  - B | Next State: C | Next State: B | Output: 0\n  - C | Next State: A | Next State: D | Output: 0\n  - D | Next State: C | Next State: B | Output: 1\n\nLogic Implementation:\n- The module should implement only the combinational logic for state transitions and output logic based on the given state transition table.\n- Derive the logic equations for `next_state` and `out` directly from the state transition table and state encoding.\n- No sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops) or clock signals are required for this specification.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- Assume that the initial state is externally managed or assumed as valid for the operation of this combinational logic.\n- Inputs and outputs adhere to active-high logic.\n- Ensure that any invalid state encodings (e.g., states other than the defined one-hot states) are handled appropriately, potentially defaulting to a known safe state like A.\n\nNote: This specification focuses on the combinational logic aspect and assumes that state storage and clocking are managed externally in a complete system design.\n                    "
