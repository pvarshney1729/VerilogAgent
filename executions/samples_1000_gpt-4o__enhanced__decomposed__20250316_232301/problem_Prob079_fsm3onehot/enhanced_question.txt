Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: `in` (1 bit) - This is the primary input signal for the state machine.
- Input: `state` (4 bits) - This represents the current state of the state machine using one-hot encoding.
- Output: `next_state` (4 bits) - This represents the next state of the state machine using one-hot encoding.
- Output: `out` (1 bit) - This is the output of the state machine based on the current state.

State Encoding:
- The state machine uses one-hot encoding for state representation, with the following mappings:
  - State A: 4'b0001
  - State B: 4'b0010
  - State C: 4'b0100
  - State D: 4'b1000

State Transition Table:
- Current State | `in` = 0 | `in` = 1 | Output
  - A | Next State: A | Next State: B | Output: 0
  - B | Next State: C | Next State: B | Output: 0
  - C | Next State: A | Next State: D | Output: 0
  - D | Next State: C | Next State: B | Output: 1

Logic Implementation:
- The module should implement only the combinational logic for state transitions and output logic based on the given state transition table.
- Derive the logic equations for `next_state` and `out` directly from the state transition table and state encoding.
- No sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops) or clock signals are required for this specification.

Additional Considerations:
- Assume that the initial state is externally managed or assumed as valid for the operation of this combinational logic.
- Inputs and outputs adhere to active-high logic.
- Ensure that any invalid state encodings (e.g., states other than the defined one-hot states) are handled appropriately, potentially defaulting to a known safe state like A.

Note: This specification focuses on the combinational logic aspect and assumes that state storage and clocking are managed externally in a complete system design.
