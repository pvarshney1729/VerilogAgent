Each bit represents a unique state in the state machine.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - output wire B3_next: Asserted when the next state is B3.\n  - output wire S_next: Asserted when the next state is S.\n  - output wire S1_next: Asserted when the next state is S1.\n  - output wire Count_next: Asserted when the next state is Count.\n  - output wire Wait_next: Asserted when the next state is Wait.\n  - output wire done: Asserted when the machine is in the Wait state.\n  - output wire counting: Asserted when the machine is in the Count state.\n  - output wire shift_ena: Asserted when the machine is in states B0, B1, B2, or B3.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- This module implements a Moore state machine with the following states and transitions:\n  - S (0000000001): Transition to S1 on d=1, otherwise stay in S.\n  - S1 (0000000010): Transition to S11 on d=1, otherwise revert to S.\n  - S11 (0000000100): Transition to S110 on d=0, otherwise stay in S11.\n  - S110 (0000001000): Transition to B0 on d=1, otherwise revert to S.\n  - B0 (0000010000): Always transition to B1, shift_ena=1.\n  - B1 (0000100000): Always transition to B2, shift_ena=1.\n  - B2 (0001000000): Always transition to B3, shift_ena=1.\n  - B3 (0010000000): Always transition to Count, shift_ena=1.\n  - Count (0100000000): Remain in Count if done_counting=0, otherwise transition to Wait, counting=1.\n  - Wait (1000000000): Remain in Wait if ack=0, otherwise transition to S, done=1.\n\nReset and Initial State:\n- The state machine initializes to the S state upon reset. Reset is asynchronous, and all state flip-flops should reset to '0' except for the bit representing the S state, which should reset to '1'.\n\nSignal Descriptions:\n- B3_next: Asserted when transitioning to B3 state.\n- S_next: Asserted when transitioning to S state.\n- S1_next: Asserted when transitioning to S1 state.\n- Count_next: Asserted when transitioning to Count state.\n- Wait_next: Asserted when transitioning to Wait state.\n- done: Asserted during Wait state.\n- counting: Asserted during Count state.\n- shift_ena: Asserted during states B0, B1, B2, and B3.\n\nNote: Each state transition and output logic is based on the one-hot encoded state representation. Ensure all output signals are derived from the current state and input conditions as specified in the state machine description.\n                    "
