Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire in` : 1-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire [1:0] state` : 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. The state is encoded as follows:\n    - A = 2'b00\n    - B = 2'b01\n    - C = 2'b10\n    - D = 2'b11\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [1:0] next_state` : 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine.\n  - `output reg out` : 1-bit output signal.\n\nState Transition and Output Logic:\n- The module implements the combinational logic for a Moore state machine with the specified state transition table. The output depends only on the current state.\n\nState Transition Table:\n- For state A (2'b00):\n  - Next state if `in` = 0: A (2'b00)\n  - Next state if `in` = 1: B (2'b01)\n  - Output: 0\n\n- For state B (2'b01):\n  - Next state if `in` = 0: C (2'b10)\n  - Next state if `in` = 1: B (2'b01)\n  - Output: 0\n\n- For state C (2'b10):\n  - Next state if `in` = 0: A (2'b00)\n  - Next state if `in` = 1: D (2'b11)\n  - Output: 0\n\n- For state D (2'b11):\n  - Next state if `in` = 0: C (2'b10)\n  - Next state if `in` = 1: B (2'b01)\n  - Output: 1\n\nAdditional Specifications:\n- The module is purely combinational and should not include any sequential logic such as flip-flops or registers.\n- The next state and output are determined entirely by the current state and the input signal `in`.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Ensure that the logic implementation avoids race conditions by properly evaluating the state transitions based on the current input and state.\n                    "
