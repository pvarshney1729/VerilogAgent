Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [1:0] state` : 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. The state is encoded as follows:
    - A = 2'b00
    - B = 2'b01
    - C = 2'b10
    - D = 2'b11

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [1:0] next_state` : 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine.
  - `output reg out` : 1-bit output signal.

State Transition and Output Logic:
- The module implements the combinational logic for a Moore state machine with the specified state transition table. The output depends only on the current state.

State Transition Table:
- For state A (2'b00):
  - Next state if `in` = 0: A (2'b00)
  - Next state if `in` = 1: B (2'b01)
  - Output: 0

- For state B (2'b01):
  - Next state if `in` = 0: C (2'b10)
  - Next state if `in` = 1: B (2'b01)
  - Output: 0

- For state C (2'b10):
  - Next state if `in` = 0: A (2'b00)
  - Next state if `in` = 1: D (2'b11)
  - Output: 0

- For state D (2'b11):
  - Next state if `in` = 0: C (2'b10)
  - Next state if `in` = 1: B (2'b01)
  - Output: 1

Additional Specifications:
- The module is purely combinational and should not include any sequential logic such as flip-flops or registers.
- The next state and output are determined entirely by the current state and the input signal `in`.
- Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).
- Ensure that the logic implementation avoids race conditions by properly evaluating the state transitions based on the current input and state.
