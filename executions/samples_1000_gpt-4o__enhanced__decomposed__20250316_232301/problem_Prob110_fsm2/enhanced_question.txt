Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
- input wire areset: Active-high asynchronous reset signal. When high, the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state.
- input wire j: Input signal used to determine state transitions from the OFF state.
- input wire k: Input signal used to determine state transitions from the ON state.
- output reg out: Output signal indicating the current state output. It reflects the state, being '0' in the OFF state and '1' in the ON state.

State Machine Description:
- The state machine is a Moore type with two states: OFF and ON.
- State Encoding:
  - OFF: State where `out` is '0'.
  - ON: State where `out` is '1'.

State Transitions:
- From OFF (out=0):
  - Remains in OFF if j=0.
  - Transitions to ON if j=1.
- From ON (out=1):
  - Remains in ON if k=0.
  - Transitions to OFF if k=1.

Reset Behavior:
- areset is an active-high asynchronous reset. 
- When areset is high, the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state regardless of clk, j, or k.
- Upon reset, the output `out` is set to '0'.

Implementation Notes:
- The module is designed as a sequential circuit using a clock signal for state transitions.
- The state transitions are evaluated on the rising edge of the clock.
- Ensure that the output `out` reflects the current state immediately after the state transition.
- The reset signal, being asynchronous, takes precedence over other inputs and state transitions.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon power-up or reset, the state machine starts in the OFF state with `out` initialized to '0'.

Additional Constraints:
- All state transitions and output updates should be completed within a single clock cycle following the conditions specified.
- The bit index is not applicable as all ports are single-bit signals.
