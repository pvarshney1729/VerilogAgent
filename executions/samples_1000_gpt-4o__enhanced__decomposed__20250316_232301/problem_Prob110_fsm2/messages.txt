Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPorts:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations.\n- input wire areset: Active-high asynchronous reset signal. When high, the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state.\n- input wire j: Input signal used to determine state transitions from the OFF state.\n- input wire k: Input signal used to determine state transitions from the ON state.\n- output reg out: Output signal indicating the current state output. It reflects the state, being '0' in the OFF state and '1' in the ON state.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The state machine is a Moore type with two states: OFF and ON.\n- State Encoding:\n  - OFF: State where `out` is '0'.\n  - ON: State where `out` is '1'.\n\nState Transitions:\n- From OFF (out=0):\n  - Remains in OFF if j=0.\n  - Transitions to ON if j=1.\n- From ON (out=1):\n  - Remains in ON if k=0.\n  - Transitions to OFF if k=1.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- areset is an active-high asynchronous reset. \n- When areset is high, the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state regardless of clk, j, or k.\n- Upon reset, the output `out` is set to '0'.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The module is designed as a sequential circuit using a clock signal for state transitions.\n- The state transitions are evaluated on the rising edge of the clock.\n- Ensure that the output `out` reflects the current state immediately after the state transition.\n- The reset signal, being asynchronous, takes precedence over other inputs and state transitions.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up or reset, the state machine starts in the OFF state with `out` initialized to '0'.\n\nAdditional Constraints:\n- All state transitions and output updates should be completed within a single clock cycle following the conditions specified.\n- The bit index is not applicable as all ports are single-bit signals.\n                    "

Use binary encoding for states OFF=2'b00 and ON=2'b01.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg [1:0] state;\n  \n  localparam OFF = 2'b00;\n  localparam ON  = 2'b01;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with asynchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) to reset the state to OFF when areset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset) begin\n      state <= OFF;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on inputs j and k according to the state diagram.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n```verilog\n[BEGIN]\n  // State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1;\n  \n  reg state, next_state;\n  \n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (state)\n      OFF: begin\n        if (j)\n          next_state = ON;\n        else\n          next_state = OFF;\n      end\n      ON: begin\n        if (k)\n          next_state = OFF;\n        else\n          next_state = ON;\n      end\n      default: next_state = OFF; // Default state\n    endcase\n  end\n[END]\n```\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statement. Set output out based on the current state: out=0 for OFF and out=1 for ON.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // Output logic based on current state\n  assign out = (state == ON) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    "
