<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The state machine transitions between these states based on the inputs `j` and `k`. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, meaning that when `areset` is high, the state machine should immediately transition to the OFF state, regardless of the clock or other inputs.

The implementation involves:
1. Defining the states using a localparam for clarity and readability.
2. Implementing the state transition logic using a combinational always block.
3. Implementing the state register with an asynchronous reset using a sequential always block.
4. Defining the output logic based on the current state, which is typical for a Moore machine.

The guidelines and coding conventions provided will be adhered to, ensuring correct syntax and behavior. The ports and signals will be declared as `logic`, and the sensitivity list for combinational logic will be inferred using `always @(*)`.
