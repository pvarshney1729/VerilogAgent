<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` is determined solely by the current state. The reset is a synchronous active-high reset that sets the state to OFF. We'll use a `logic` type for all signals, as per the coding conventions. The state transitions and output logic will be implemented using two always blocks: one for sequential logic (state transitions) and one for combinational logic (next state and output logic). The state encoding will be binary, with OFF as 0 and ON as 1.
