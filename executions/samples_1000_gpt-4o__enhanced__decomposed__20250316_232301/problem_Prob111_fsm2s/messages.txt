Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. This signal is used for synchronous operations.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset input. When asserted, the state machine transitions to the initial state, OFF.\n  - `j`: 1-bit input determining state transitions from OFF state.\n  - `k`: 1-bit input determining state transitions from ON state.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output reflecting the current state of the state machine. This signal is 0 in the OFF state and 1 in the ON state.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- This is a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.\n- State Encoding:\n  - `OFF`: The state where `out` is 0.\n  - `ON`: The state where `out` is 1.\n\nState Transition Logic:\n- From state `OFF`:\n  - If `j` is 0, remain in state OFF.\n  - If `j` is 1, transition to state ON.\n\n- From state `ON`:\n  - If `k` is 0, remain in state ON.\n  - If `k` is 1, transition to state OFF.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is a synchronous active-high reset.\n- When `reset` is asserted (i.e., `reset` is 1), the state machine transitions to the OFF state, regardless of the inputs `j` or `k`.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- All inputs and outputs are 1-bit wide, with the least significant bit (bit[0]) representing the value of the signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, the state machine must be in the OFF state, which means `out` will output 0.\n\nClock Cycle Relationships:\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The output `out` is updated synchronously with the state transitions.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that transitions are correctly handled on the rising edge of `clk` and that `reset` takes precedence over inputs `j` and `k` during a reset condition.\n                    "

Use binary encoding: OFF=2'b00, ON=2'b01.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding using localparam\n  localparam OFF = 2'b00;\n  localparam ON  = 2'b01;\n\n  // State register declaration\n  reg [1:0] state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with synchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk) and reset to state OFF when reset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      state <= OFF;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on inputs j and k according to the state diagram.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  reg state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (state)\n      OFF: begin\n        if (j)\n          next_state = ON;\n        else\n          next_state = OFF;\n      end\n      ON: begin\n        if (k)\n          next_state = OFF;\n        else\n          next_state = ON;\n      end\n      default: next_state = OFF; // Default to OFF state\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statement. Set output out based on the current state: out=0 for OFF, out=1 for ON.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n```verilog\n[BEGIN]\n  // State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // State register\n  reg current_state;\n\n  // Output logic based on current state\n  assign out = (current_state == ON) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n[END]\n```\n                    "
