Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. This signal is used for synchronous operations.
  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset input. When asserted, the state machine transitions to the initial state, OFF.
  - `j`: 1-bit input determining state transitions from OFF state.
  - `k`: 1-bit input determining state transitions from ON state.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output reflecting the current state of the state machine. This signal is 0 in the OFF state and 1 in the ON state.

State Machine Description:
- This is a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- State Encoding:
  - `OFF`: The state where `out` is 0.
  - `ON`: The state where `out` is 1.

State Transition Logic:
- From state `OFF`:
  - If `j` is 0, remain in state OFF.
  - If `j` is 1, transition to state ON.

- From state `ON`:
  - If `k` is 0, remain in state ON.
  - If `k` is 1, transition to state OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is a synchronous active-high reset.
- When `reset` is asserted (i.e., `reset` is 1), the state machine transitions to the OFF state, regardless of the inputs `j` or `k`.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are 1-bit wide, with the least significant bit (bit[0]) representing the value of the signal.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the state machine must be in the OFF state, which means `out` will output 0.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- The output `out` is updated synchronously with the state transitions.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that transitions are correctly handled on the rising edge of `clk` and that `reset` takes precedence over inputs `j` and `k` during a reset condition.
