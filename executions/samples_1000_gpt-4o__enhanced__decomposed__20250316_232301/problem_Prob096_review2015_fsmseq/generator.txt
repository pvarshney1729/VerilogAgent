<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we will use a finite state machine (FSM) to detect the sequence "1101" in the input bit stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
2. **S1**: First '1' detected.
3. **S11**: Second '1' detected.
4. **S110**: Sequence "110" detected.
5. **FOUND**: Sequence "1101" detected.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. When the sequence "1101" is detected, the FSM enters the `FOUND` state, and the output `start_shifting` is set to 1. This output remains 1 until a reset occurs.

The reset is synchronous, meaning it will only take effect on the rising edge of the clock. We will ensure that the reset logic is handled correctly by including it in the sequential logic block.

We will use `logic` for all signals, as per the coding conventions. The FSM will be implemented using a combination of sequential and combinational logic. The sequential logic will update the current state based on the clock and reset, while the combinational logic will determine the next state based on the current state and input `data`.

The output `start_shifting` will be driven by a register that is set when the FSM reaches the `FOUND` state and reset when the reset signal is asserted.

The implementation will adhere to the specified interface and signal names, ensuring that all ports are declared as `logic` and that the FSM operates correctly with respect to the clock and reset signals.
