        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specifications:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, used for synchronization of sequential logic. Triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal. When high, initializes the output register.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `q`: 32-bit output vector representing the current state of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). Bit indexing uses `q[31:0]`, where `q[0]` is the least significant bit.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- The initial state of the LFSR upon reset is set to `32'h00000001`.\n- This LFSR configuration includes taps at the following bit positions: 31 (MSB), 21, 1, and 0 (LSB). Note that bit positions are zero-indexed.\n- On each positive edge of the `clk`, the LFSR shifts right by one bit.\n- The next value of each tapped bit position is calculated by XORing its current value with the current value of the LSB, `q[0]`. Non-tapped bits simply shift right.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning it only takes effect on a positive clock edge.\n- When `reset` is asserted high, the output `q` is set to the initial state of `32'h00000001`.\n\nBit Position and Indexing:\n- The LFSR uses a 32-bit vector `q[31:0]`, where `q[0]` is the least significant bit.\n- Taps are applied as follows: `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The output `q` must be reset to `32'h00000001` whenever `reset` is active high on a clock edge.\n- Ensure that the LFSR does not enter a state of all zeros, as this would halt the sequence.\n\nClock Cycle Relationships:\n- The shift and feedback operations occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal, ensuring all operations are synchronized.\n\nBy adhering to the above specifications, the implementation will yield a correctly functioning 32-bit Galois LFSR with the desired tap positions and synchronous reset behavior.\n                    "
