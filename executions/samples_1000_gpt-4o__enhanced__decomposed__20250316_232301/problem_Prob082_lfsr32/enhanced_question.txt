Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, used for synchronization of sequential logic. Triggered on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal. When high, initializes the output register.

- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 32-bit output vector representing the current state of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). Bit indexing uses `q[31:0]`, where `q[0]` is the least significant bit.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- The initial state of the LFSR upon reset is set to `32'h00000001`.
- This LFSR configuration includes taps at the following bit positions: 31 (MSB), 21, 1, and 0 (LSB). Note that bit positions are zero-indexed.
- On each positive edge of the `clk`, the LFSR shifts right by one bit.
- The next value of each tapped bit position is calculated by XORing its current value with the current value of the LSB, `q[0]`. Non-tapped bits simply shift right.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous, meaning it only takes effect on a positive clock edge.
- When `reset` is asserted high, the output `q` is set to the initial state of `32'h00000001`.

Bit Position and Indexing:
- The LFSR uses a 32-bit vector `q[31:0]`, where `q[0]` is the least significant bit.
- Taps are applied as follows: `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The output `q` must be reset to `32'h00000001` whenever `reset` is active high on a clock edge.
- Ensure that the LFSR does not enter a state of all zeros, as this would halt the sequence.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- The shift and feedback operations occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal, ensuring all operations are synchronized.

By adhering to the above specifications, the implementation will yield a correctly functioning 32-bit Galois LFSR with the desired tap positions and synchronous reset behavior.
