<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles upon reset and then keep it deasserted until the next reset. The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the rising edge of the clock.

1. **State Representation**: We will use a simple counter to track the number of cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted. A 3-bit counter is sufficient to count up to 4 cycles.

2. **State Initialization**: On reset, the counter is initialized to 4, and `shift_ena` is asserted. The counter will decrement on each clock cycle until it reaches zero, at which point `shift_ena` will be deasserted.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is included in the sequential always block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. This ensures that the reset is synchronous.

4. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` signal is directly controlled by the counter value. It is asserted when the counter is non-zero.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the sensitivity list for combinational logic will be `always @(*)`. Numeric constants will be sized appropriately.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specification and adheres to the coding conventions provided.
