Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit, clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit, active-high, synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `shift_ena`: 1-bit, control signal to enable the shift register.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module is part of a finite state machine (FSM) that controls a shift register.\n- The FSM should enable the shift register (`shift_ena` = 1) for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles whenever a specified bit pattern is detected.\n- Upon activation of the reset signal (`reset` = 1), the FSM must assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles and then deassert `shift_ena` (set to 0) indefinitely until the next reset is detected.\n- The reset is synchronous; the reset condition is checked and acted upon at the positive edge of the clock signal.\n\nSignal and Operation Details:\n- The FSM should have a defined initial state upon reset.\n- The `shift_ena` signal should be set to 0 after the initial 4-cycle assertion following a reset, and until the specified bit pattern is detected again.\n- Ensure that any bit pattern detection logic is clearly defined and operates correctly within the context of the FSM.\n\nInitial Values and Edge Cases:\n- All state registers in the FSM should have explicitly defined initial values during synthesizable reset conditions.\n- The behavior of the FSM should be clearly defined for all possible input conditions including edge cases like continuous reset signals or undefined bit patterns.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Bit pattern detection and state transitions must be clearly documented, ensuring no ambiguity in the intended operation.\n- All flip-flops, registers, and sequential elements should have well-defined behavior on reset and during normal operation.\n- Specify precedence for any operations where multiple conditions might simultaneously affect the `shift_ena` signal.\n                    "
