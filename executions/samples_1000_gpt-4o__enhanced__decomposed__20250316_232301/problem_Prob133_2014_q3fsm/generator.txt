<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) with two main states: A and B. The FSM starts in state A and transitions to state B when `s` is 1. In state B, the FSM monitors the input `w` for three clock cycles, counting how many times `w` is 1. If `w` is 1 exactly twice during these three cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the next cycle; otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The FSM then continues to monitor `w` in sets of three cycles.

The implementation involves:
1. Defining the states and state transitions.
2. Implementing a counter to track the number of cycles in state B and the number of times `w` is 1.
3. Using a synchronous reset to initialize the FSM to state A.
4. Ensuring that all logic is synchronous with the positive edge of the clock.

The FSM will use a state register to hold the current state and a next state logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs. A counter will be used to count the occurrences of `w` being 1 during the three cycles in state B.

The code will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.
