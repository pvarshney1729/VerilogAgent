Module Name: `TopModule`

Interface:
- `input clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.
- `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- `input s`: One-bit input signal for state transition control.
- `input w`: One-bit input signal for FSM operation in state B.
- `output reg z`: One-bit output signal, indicating condition met.

State Machine Description:
- The FSM begins in the reset state, State A.
- State A Behavior:
  - Remain in State A as long as `s = 0`.
  - Transition to State B on the next positive clock edge if `s = 1`.

- State B Behavior:
  - Continuously examine the input `w` for three consecutive clock cycles.
  - Count the occurrences of `w = 1` during these three cycles.
  - If `w = 1` exactly twice during these cycles, set `z = 1` on the fourth cycle.
  - Otherwise, set `z = 0` on the fourth cycle.
  - Repeat the sequence, continuously checking `w` in sets of three cycles.

Reset and Initialization:
- On assertion of the active-high synchronous reset, the FSM returns to State A.
- All registers and outputs, including `z`, should be initialized to 0 upon reset.

Clocking and Timing:
- The design is based on a positive edge-triggered clock.
- Ensure no race conditions by synchronizing all sequential elements to the clock edge.

Signal Details:
- `z` is updated based on the count of `w` after every three clock cycles in State B.
- `s` is only relevant when the FSM is in State A for determining the transition to State B.

Edge Cases:
- If `s` remains 0 indefinitely, the FSM will not transition out of State A.
- Ensure no assumptions of `w` values outside specified conditions when in State A.

General Constraints:
- Use minimal states to fulfill the specified FSM behavior.
- Ensure all operations are well-defined for each state transition and output calculation.

Note: Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.
