Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input wire reset: Synchronous, active-high reset signal. Resets the FSM to state 3'b000.
- input wire x: Input signal for state transition, 1-bit.
- output reg z: Output signal, 1-bit.

FSM Details:
- The finite-state machine (FSM) is a synchronous sequential logic design.
- State Encoding: The FSM has 5 states, encoded as 3-bit values (y[2:0]).
  - State 000: Initial state upon reset.
  - State 001
  - State 010
  - State 011
  - State 100

State Transition Table:
- Present State (y[2:0]) | Next State (y[2:0]) if x=0, Next State (y[2:0]) if x=1 | Output z
  - 000 | 000, 001 | z = 0
  - 001 | 001, 100 | z = 0
  - 010 | 010, 001 | z = 0
  - 011 | 001, 010 | z = 1
  - 100 | 011, 100 | z = 1

Operational Details:
- The FSM transitions between states based on the input 'x', at each rising edge of the clock.
- The reset ('reset') is a synchronous signal and will cause the FSM to return to state 000 when asserted high at the clock's rising edge.
- Output 'z' is defined by the current state and reflects the values described in the state transition table.

Edge Cases and Initial Conditions:
- On reset, the FSM initializes to state 000.
- All transitions and outputs are evaluated on the positive edge of the clock.
- The system behavior for undefined states is not specified and should be considered as don't care for FSM synthesis purposes.
