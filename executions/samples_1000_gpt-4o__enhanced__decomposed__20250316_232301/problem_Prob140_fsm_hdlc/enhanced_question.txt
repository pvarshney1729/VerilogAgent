Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, triggering on the positive edge.
  - reset: 1-bit, active high synchronous reset signal.
  - in: 1-bit, input bit stream.

- Output Ports:
  - disc: 1-bit, output signal indicating a bit should be discarded.
  - flag: 1-bit, output signal indicating the beginning or end of a frame.
  - err: 1-bit, output signal indicating an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.

Functional Description:
The module implements a Moore-type Finite State Machine (FSM) to process a continuous bit stream according to the Synchronous HDLC framing rules, adhering to these conditions:

1. Detect the sequence "0111110":
   - Output `disc` is asserted for one complete clock cycle starting from the cycle after detection.
   - This sequence indicates a bit needs to be discarded to maintain frame integrity.

2. Detect the sequence "01111110":
   - Output `flag` is asserted for one complete clock cycle starting from the cycle after detection.
   - This sequence indicates a flag, marking the beginning or end of a frame.

3. Detect "01111111" or more consecutive 1s:
   - Output `err` is asserted for one complete clock cycle starting from the cycle after detection.
   - This condition signals an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s, which is not allowed in the valid data stream.

FSM Behavior:
- The FSM should reset to an initial state that behaves as if the previous input was 0.
- State transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The FSM should have clearly defined states for detecting and handling each specified bit pattern.
- All output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted synchronously with the clock.

Reset Behavior:
- The `reset` signal is an active high synchronous reset.
- Upon reset, the FSM transitions to the initial state, ensuring it behaves as if the previous input was 0.
- All outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be deasserted immediately upon reset.

Bit Indexing:
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Edge Case Handling:
- Ensure correct state transitions and output assertions even at the boundaries of input sequences.
- Properly handle transitions from one sequence to another, avoiding false detections.

Initial Values:
- Define initial states and values for all registers and flip-flops to ensure predictable behavior on startup and reset.
