<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to design a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) that detects specific sequences in a bit stream. The FSM will have states corresponding to the number of consecutive '1's detected. The FSM will transition between states based on the input bit and will assert the appropriate output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) based on the detected sequence.

1. **State Encoding**: We will define states to track the number of consecutive '1's. The states will be:
   - `IDLE`: Initial state, behaves as if the previous input was '0'.
   - `ONE` to `FIVE`: States representing 1 to 5 consecutive '1's.
   - `SIX`: State representing 6 consecutive '1's.
   - `SEVEN`: State representing 7 or more consecutive '1's (error condition).

2. **State Transitions**: 
   - From `IDLE`, if '1' is detected, transition to `ONE`.
   - From `ONE` to `FIVE`, transition to the next state if '1' is detected, otherwise return to `IDLE`.
   - From `FIVE`, if '0' is detected, assert `disc` and return to `IDLE`.
   - From `SIX`, if '0' is detected, assert `flag` and return to `IDLE`.
   - From `SIX`, if '1' is detected, transition to `SEVEN`.
   - From `SEVEN`, assert `err` and remain in `SEVEN` if '1' is detected, otherwise return to `IDLE`.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are asserted based on the current state and the input bit.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM will reset to the `IDLE` state on a synchronous reset signal.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and follow the specified coding conventions for clarity and correctness.

The following Verilog code implements this FSM.
