Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, triggering on the positive edge.\n  - reset: 1-bit, active high synchronous reset signal.\n  - in: 1-bit, input bit stream.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - disc: 1-bit, output signal indicating a bit should be discarded.\n  - flag: 1-bit, output signal indicating the beginning or end of a frame.\n  - err: 1-bit, output signal indicating an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Moore-type Finite State Machine (FSM) to process a continuous bit stream according to the Synchronous HDLC framing rules, adhering to these conditions:\n\n1. Detect the sequence \"0111110\":\n   - Output `disc` is asserted for one complete clock cycle starting from the cycle after detection.\n   - This sequence indicates a bit needs to be discarded to maintain frame integrity.\n\n2. Detect the sequence \"01111110\":\n   - Output `flag` is asserted for one complete clock cycle starting from the cycle after detection.\n   - This sequence indicates a flag, marking the beginning or end of a frame.\n\n3. Detect \"01111111\" or more consecutive 1s:\n   - Output `err` is asserted for one complete clock cycle starting from the cycle after detection.\n   - This condition signals an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s, which is not allowed in the valid data stream.\n\nFSM Behavior:\n- The FSM should reset to an initial state that behaves as if the previous input was 0.\n- State transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The FSM should have clearly defined states for detecting and handling each specified bit pattern.\n- All output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted synchronously with the clock.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The `reset` signal is an active high synchronous reset.\n- Upon reset, the FSM transitions to the initial state, ensuring it behaves as if the previous input was 0.\n- All outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be deasserted immediately upon reset.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Ensure correct state transitions and output assertions even at the boundaries of input sequences.\n- Properly handle transitions from one sequence to another, avoiding false detections.\n\nInitial Values:\n- Define initial states and values for all registers and flip-flops to ensure predictable behavior on startup and reset.\n                    "
