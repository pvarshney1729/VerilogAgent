        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, used to trigger all sequential logic on its positive edge.\n  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal, used to initialize the module's state.\n  - `input in`: Serial input stream, one bit per clock cycle.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output done`: Indicates a complete and correctly received byte (including start and stop bits).\n\nProtocol Specification:\n- The serial communication protocol uses:\n  - One start bit (`0`)\n  - Eight data bits (sent least significant bit first)\n  - One stop bit (`1`)\n  - Idle line is at logic `1`\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Requirements:\n- The FSM should transition through the following states:\n  1. Idle: Waits for a start bit (`0`).\n  2. Receiving: Captures 8 data bits sequentially.\n  3. Stop Check: Verifies the presence of a stop bit (`1`).\n  4. Done: Signals a successfully received byte and returns to Idle.\n\n- If the correct stop bit is not detected, the FSM should ignore incoming bits until another stop bit (`1`) is found, indicating the line is idle again. Only then should the FSM reset to the Idle state to begin receiving the next byte.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On activation of the synchronous reset, the FSM returns to the Idle state immediately, regardless of the current state. All internal registers should be initialized to a known state upon reset.\n\nSignal Timing and Edge Cases:\n- Ensure all state transitions and logic operations are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Properly handle edge cases where:\n  - The start bit is missed due to noise.\n  - The stop bit is incorrect or missing.\n  - Data bits are corrupted.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- Data bits are captured in a shift register starting from the least significant bit (bit[0]) to the most significant bit (bit[7]).\n\nThis specification aims for clarity and accuracy in implementing the described serial communication protocol decoder.\n                    "
