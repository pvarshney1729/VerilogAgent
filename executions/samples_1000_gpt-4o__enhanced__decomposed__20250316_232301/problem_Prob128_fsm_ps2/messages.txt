        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input wire clk`: This is the clock signal. The module operates on the rising edge of this clock.\n- `input wire reset`: An active-high, synchronous reset signal. When high, the FSM will reset to its initial state.\n- `input wire [7:0] in`: An 8-bit input bus representing the incoming byte stream. Bit 0 is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit 7 is the most significant bit (MSB).\n- `output reg done`: A 1-bit output signal that goes high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte of a message is successfully received.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify and process message boundaries in a continuous byte stream following the PS/2 mouse protocol. The FSM has the following operational details:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The FSM starts in an idle state (STATE_IDLE), waiting for the first byte of a message.\n\n2. **Byte Detection**:\n   - The FSM discards incoming bytes until it detects a byte with `in[3] == 1`.\n   - Upon detection, it transitions to the next state, indicating the receipt of the first byte of a message (STATE_BYTE1).\n\n3. **Message Tracking**:\n   - The FSM tracks the receipt of three consecutive bytes.\n   - Transition states are as follows:\n     - From STATE_BYTE1 to STATE_BYTE2 upon receiving the next byte.\n     - From STATE_BYTE2 to STATE_DONE after the third byte is received.\n\n4. **Done Signal**:\n   - The `done` signal is asserted (set high) for one clock cycle immediately following the complete receipt of the third byte (in STATE_DONE), indicating the end of the message.\n\n5. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - On the rising edge of the `clk`, if `reset` is high, the FSM returns to STATE_IDLE, and all internal counters and signals are reset to their initial values.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the stream is interrupted or reset is asserted during the message, the FSM will reset and begin re-evaluating the byte stream from the idle state.\n\nState Definitions:\n- STATE_IDLE: Waiting for a byte with `in[3] == 1`.\n- STATE_BYTE1: First byte of a message has been detected.\n- STATE_BYTE2: Second byte of a message has been received.\n- STATE_DONE: Third byte received; `done` is asserted next clock cycle.\n\nEnsure that all state transitions and signal assertions are executed on the rising edge of the clock to prevent race conditions.\n\nAll sequential elements should have explicitly defined initial values upon reset to ensure deterministic behavior.\n                    "
