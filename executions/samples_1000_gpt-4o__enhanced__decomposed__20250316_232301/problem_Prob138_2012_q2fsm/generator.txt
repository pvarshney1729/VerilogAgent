To implement the state machine as specified, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Module Interface**: The module `TopModule` will have inputs `clk`, `reset`, `w`, and output `z`. All ports are one bit.

2. **State Encoding**: Use a 3-bit encoding for the states A, B, C, D, E, and F. This allows us to represent each state uniquely.

3. **State Register**: Implement a state register using an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The state register will also handle the synchronous reset, setting the state to A when `reset` is high.

4. **Next State Logic**: Implement the state transition logic using an always block with a combinational sensitivity list (`always @(*)`). This block will determine the next state based on the current state and input `w`.

5. **Output Logic**: Implement the output logic for `z` using either a continuous assignment or an always block. Since `z` is determined by the current state, we can use a continuous assignment for simplicity.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding guidelines.
