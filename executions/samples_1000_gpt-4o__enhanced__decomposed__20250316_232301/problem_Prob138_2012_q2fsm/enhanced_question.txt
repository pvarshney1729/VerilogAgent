Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input  logic clk            // Clock signal for synchronous logic, positive edge-triggered
- input  logic reset          // Synchronous active-high reset signal, resets to state A
- input  logic w              // One-bit input signal driving state transitions
- output logic z              // One-bit output signal, determined by the current state

State Encoding (using binary encoding):
- State A: 3'b000
- State B: 3'b001
- State C: 3'b010
- State D: 3'b011
- State E: 3'b100
- State F: 3'b101

State Machine Specification:
- Initial State: State A upon reset
- Transition Table:
  - A (z = 0): 
    - w = 1: Transition to State B
    - w = 0: Remain in State A
  - B (z = 0): 
    - w = 1: Transition to State C
    - w = 0: Transition to State D
  - C (z = 0): 
    - w = 1: Transition to State E
    - w = 0: Transition to State D
  - D (z = 0): 
    - w = 1: Transition to State F
    - w = 0: Transition to State A
  - E (z = 1): 
    - w = 1: Remain in State E
    - w = 0: Transition to State D
  - F (z = 1): 
    - w = 1: Transition to State C
    - w = 0: Transition to State D

FSM Output Logic:
- Output z is determined by the current state:
  - States A, B, C, D: z = 0
  - States E, F: z = 1

Implementation Notes:
- Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic (next state logic) and the state register (current state storage).
- Ensure that reset is handled in the state register always block to initialize the state to A.
- Ensure that all combinational logic has explicitly defined dependencies to avoid race conditions.
- All state transitions and output logic should be evaluated on the positive edge of the clock.
