Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronizing the sequential logic.
- input wire reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- input wire in: Single-bit input to the state machine.
- output reg out: Single-bit output of the state machine.

State Machine Description:
- This is a Moore state machine with two states: State A and State B.
- The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state.

States:
- State B: Represents the reset state.
  - Output (out): 1
  - Transitions:
    - If 'in' = 0, transition to State A.
    - If 'in' = 1, remain in State B.
- State A:
  - Output (out): 0
  - Transitions:
    - If 'in' = 0, transition to State B.
    - If 'in' = 1, remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- Reset is active-high and synchronous with the clock.
- On reset, the state machine transitions to State B and the output 'out' is set to 1.

Clocking:
- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.
- No specific bit indexing is required as all signals are one bit wide.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the state is initialized to State B and the output 'out' is set to its corresponding value.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure no race conditions by properly synchronizing the reset and state transitions with the clock signal.
- The module should strictly adhere to the specified state transitions and output conditions.
