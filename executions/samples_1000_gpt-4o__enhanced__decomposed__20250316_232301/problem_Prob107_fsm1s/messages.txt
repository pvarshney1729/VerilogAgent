Use binary encoding for states: A=2'b00, B=2'b01.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding using binary encoding\n  parameter A = 2'b00;\n  parameter B = 2'b01;\n\n  // State register declaration\n  reg [1:0] current_state, next_state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with synchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk) and set the state to B on reset.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  parameter A = 1'b0, B = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      state <= B;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be added here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on the input 'in' and current state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam STATE_A = 1'b0;\n  localparam STATE_B = 1'b1;\n\n  // State register\n  reg current_state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_B: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n      end\n      STATE_A: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n      end\n      default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to reset state\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statements. Set output 'out' based on the current state: out=1 for state B, out=0 for state A.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n```verilog\n[BEGIN]\n  // State encoding\n  localparam STATE_A = 1'b0;\n  localparam STATE_B = 1'b1;\n\n  // State register\n  reg current_state;\n\n  // Output combinational logic\n  assign out = (current_state == STATE_B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n[END]\n```\n                    "
