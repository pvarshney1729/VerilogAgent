Use reg [1:0] for state and next_state. Define localparam for states A and B with binary encoding (A=2'b00, B=2'b01).\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam A = 2'b00;\n  localparam B = 2'b01;\n\n  // State registers\n  reg [1:0] state, next_state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with asynchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) to set the state to B on reset, otherwise update state to next_state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state, next_state;\n  \n  // State encoding\n  localparam A = 1'b0;\n  localparam B = 1'b1;\n\n  // State register with asynchronous reset\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset)\n      state <= B;\n    else\n      state <= next_state;\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*). Define state transitions based on the current state and input in, following the state diagram.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [0:0] {\n    STATE_A = 1'b0,\n    STATE_B = 1'b1\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_A: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n      end\n      STATE_B: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n      end\n      default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to state B\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statements. Set output out based on the current state: out = 1 for state B, out = 0 for state A.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nassign out = (state == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    "
