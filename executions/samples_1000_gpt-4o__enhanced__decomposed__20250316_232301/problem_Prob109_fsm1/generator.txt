<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The machine has two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, making it a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a single bit to encode the states, where `0` represents state A and `1` represents state B.

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The machine should reset to state B when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock. This requires including `areset` in the sensitivity list of the always block handling state transitions.

3. **State Transition Logic**: We will use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. It is `0` in state A and `1` in state B.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals and follow the guidelines for always blocks and numeric constants.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions.
