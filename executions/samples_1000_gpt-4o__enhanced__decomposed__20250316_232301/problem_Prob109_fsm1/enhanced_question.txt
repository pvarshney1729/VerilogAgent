<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronizing the sequential logic.
- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal; active high.
- input wire in: Input signal for state transitions.
- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state's output value.

State Definitions:
- State A: Output value = 0
- State B: Output value = 1

State Transition Diagram:
- From State B: 
  - On input '0', transition to State A.
  - On input '1', remain in State B.
- From State A: 
  - On input '0', transition to State B.
  - On input '1', remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- Asynchronous reset to State B when areset is high, overriding any other inputs or clock edges.

Clock and Reset:
- The state transition occurs on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The module should asynchronously reset to State B if areset is high, regardless of the clock state.

Output Specification:
- The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state:
  - It reflects the output value associated with the current state as defined above.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure the module properly handles all possible input combinations and initial conditions.
- On power-up, if areset is not asserted, the initial state is undefined until the next reset or clock edge.

Note:
- All state transitions are synchronous with respect to the clk signal except for the asynchronous reset.
- The design must ensure glitch-free output transitions when moving between states.
