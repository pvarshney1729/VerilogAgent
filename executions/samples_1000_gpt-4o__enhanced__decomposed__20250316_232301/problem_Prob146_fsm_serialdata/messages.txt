        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- `input  logic clk`: Clock signal, triggers all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n- `input  logic in`: Serial data input stream, represents a sequence of bits.\n- `input  logic reset`: Active-high synchronous reset, initializes the FSM and all internal states.\n- `output logic [7:0] out_byte`: 8-bit output representing the received data byte, valid when `done` is high.\n- `output logic done`: Output signal indicating the completion of a byte reception and that `out_byte` holds valid data.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to parse incoming serial data according to the following protocol:\n   - One start bit (logic 0)\n   - Eight data bits (LSB first)\n   - One stop bit (logic 1)\n   - The line remains at logic 1 during idle periods.\n\n2. FSM Operation:\n   - **Idle State**: The FSM remains in this state when `in` is logic 1, indicating the line is idle.\n   - **Start Bit Detection**: Transition to the \"Receiving\" state upon detecting a start bit (logic 0).\n   - **Data Bit Reception**: Sequentially capture 8 data bits starting from the least significant bit. Each bit is captured on the positive edge of `clk`.\n   - **Stop Bit Verification**: After receiving all data bits, verify the presence of a stop bit (logic 1).\n   - **Output Validity**: If the stop bit is correctly detected, assert `done` high and load `out_byte` with the received byte. If the stop bit is incorrect, discard the byte and await the next start bit.\n\n3. Edge Case Handling:\n   - If a stop bit is not detected when expected, the FSM resets to the \"Idle\" state and waits for a new start bit.\n   - During reset (`reset` high), the FSM returns to the initial state, `out_byte` is undefined, and `done` is low.\n\n4. Bit Indexing and Conventions:\n   - The least significant bit (LSB) of the data byte is received first and corresponds to `out_byte[0]`.\n   - `out_byte[7]` represents the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n5. Initialization:\n   - On reset, all internal registers and states are initialized to their default values to ensure correct FSM operation.\n\n6. Timing and Constraints:\n   - All sequential operations are synchronized to the positive edge of the clock.\n   - Ensure that `done` is asserted only when a complete, valid byte has been received and verified.\n\nThis specification ensures a robust and clear implementation of the serial data reception process, adhering to the described protocol and handling invalid conditions appropriately.\n                    "
