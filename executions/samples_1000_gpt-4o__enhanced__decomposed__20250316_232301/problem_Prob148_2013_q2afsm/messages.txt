        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. The following describes the interface and internal behavior specifications to ensure correct implementation.\n\n### Interface Definition\n- **input clk**: Clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.\n- **input resetn**: Active-low synchronous reset signal. When asserted (`resetn = 0`), the FSM resets to state A.\n- **input [2:0] r**: Request signals from three devices, where `r[0]` refers to device 0, `r[1]` to device 1, and `r[2]` to device 2. Each bit is independent and indicates a request when set to 1.\n- **output reg [2:0] g**: Grant signals corresponding to the request signals. `g[0]` for device 0, `g[1]` for device 1, and `g[2]` for device 2. Each bit is set to 1 when the respective device is granted access.\n\n### State Encoding and FSM Description\n- State encoding can be implemented using binary or one-hot encoding as preferred. For clarity, we suggest the following states:\n  - **State A**: 2'b00\n  - **State B**: 2'b01 (indicates `g[0]=1`)\n  - **State C**: 2'b10 (indicates `g[1]=1`)\n  - **State D**: 2'b11 (indicates `g[2]=1`)\n\n### FSM State Transitions\n- **State A**:\n  - Transition to **State B** if `r[0] = 1`.\n  - Transition to **State C** if `r[0] = 0` and `r[1] = 1`.\n  - Transition to **State D** if `r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, and `r[2] = 1`.\n  - Remain in **State A** if `r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, and `r[2] = 0`.\n\n- **State B**: (Output `g[0] = 1`)\n  - Remain in **State B** if `r[0] = 1`.\n  - Transition to **State A** if `r[0] = 0`.\n\n- **State C**: (Output `g[1] = 1`)\n  - Remain in **State C** if `r[1] = 1`.\n  - Transition to **State A** if `r[1] = 0`.\n\n- **State D**: (Output `g[2] = 1`)\n  - Remain in **State D** if `r[2] = 1`.\n  - Transition to **State A** if `r[2] = 0`.\n\n### Logic Implementation Details\n- Use separate `always` blocks for state transition logic and state register updates.\n- The state register should update on the positive edge of `clk` and respect the synchronous reset condition (`resetn`).\n- Output logic (`g`) can be implemented using a continuous assignment or an `always` block. It should reflect the current state as follows:\n  - In **State B**, set `g[0] = 1`, all others to 0.\n  - In **State C**, set `g[1] = 1`, all others to 0.\n  - In **State D**, set `g[2] = 1`, all others to 0.\n  - In **State A**, set all `g[i] = 0`.\n\n### Initial Conditions\n- Upon reset, or when `resetn` is asserted, transition the FSM to **State A**.\n- Ensure all flip-flops and registers are initialized to a known state, consistent with the reset behavior.\n\nThis FSM prioritizes requests based on device index, with device 0 having the highest priority and device 2 having the lowest priority.\n                    "
