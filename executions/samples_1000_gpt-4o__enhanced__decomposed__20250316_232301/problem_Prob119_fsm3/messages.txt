Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\n- Inputs:\n  - clk: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - areset: 1-bit asynchronous reset input. It resets the FSM to state A when asserted, independent of the clock.\n  - in: 1-bit input signal used for state transitions.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - out: 1-bit output signal determined by the current state of the FSM.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Type: Moore state machine\n- Number of States: 4 (States are named A, B, C, and D)\n- State Encoding: Use a 2-bit state encoding, with bit[1] as the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB).\n  - State A: 2'b00\n  - State B: 2'b01\n  - State C: 2'b10\n  - State D: 2'b11\n\nState Transition Table:\n- Current State: A\n  - Next State: A if in=0, B if in=1\n  - Output: 0\n- Current State: B\n  - Next State: C if in=0, B if in=1\n  - Output: 0\n- Current State: C\n  - Next State: A if in=0, D if in=1\n  - Output: 0\n- Current State: D\n  - Next State: C if in=0, B if in=1\n  - Output: 1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The asynchronous reset (areset) is active-high. When asserted, it immediately sets the FSM to state A, regardless of the clock.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On power-up or reset, the FSM should start in state A.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state, not by the input signal 'in'.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure proper handling of transitions when the input signal 'in' changes near the clock edge to avoid race conditions.\n- The behavior of the FSM is fully defined for all possible combinations of states and input values.\n                    "
