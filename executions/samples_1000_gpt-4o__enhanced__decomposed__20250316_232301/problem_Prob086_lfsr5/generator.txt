<REASONING>
To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The output `q` is a 5-bit vector.

2. **Signal Declaration**: Use `logic` to declare the internal signals and the output `q` as per the coding conventions.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the LFSR to the state `00001` when the `reset` signal is high on the rising edge of the clock.

4. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the Galois LFSR logic. The LFSR shifts right, and the new value for the MSB (`q[4]`) is determined by XORing the current LSB (`q[0]`) with the bit at position 3 (`q[2]`). The rest of the bits shift right as usual.

5. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always_ff` block to handle the sequential logic triggered by the positive edge of the clock.

6. **Output Assignment**: Assign the internal LFSR state to the output `q`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specified behavior and coding conventions.
