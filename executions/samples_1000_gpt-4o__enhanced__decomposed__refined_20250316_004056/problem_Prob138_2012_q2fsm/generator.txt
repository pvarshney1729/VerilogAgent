<REASONING>
To implement the finite state machine (FSM) as specified, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **State Encoding**: We define an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the states A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each state is assigned a unique 3-bit binary code.

2. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always @(*)` block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `w`. This block implements the state transition table provided in the specification.

3. **State Flip-Flops**: We use an `always @(posedge clk)` block to update the current state on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset logic ensures that the FSM resets to state A when the reset signal is high.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined by the current state. It is set to 1 when the FSM is in states E or F, and 0 otherwise. We use a continuous assignment statement for this logic.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for signal declarations, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure that the FSM behaves as specified and adheres to the provided guidelines and conventions.
