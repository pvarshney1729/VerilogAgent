The module named `TopModule` will implement a finite state machine (FSM) with the following interface. All input and output ports are single-bit signals unless otherwise specified.

- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.
  - `input w`: Input signal for state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - `output z`: Output signal based on the current state.

The FSM consists of six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F, with state transitions controlled by the input `w`. The output `z` is determined by the current state as follows:

- State A (output `z = 0`):
  - `w = 1`: Transition to State B.
  - `w = 0`: Remain in State A.

- State B (output `z = 0`):
  - `w = 1`: Transition to State C.
  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.

- State C (output `z = 0`):
  - `w = 1`: Transition to State E.
  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.

- State D (output `z = 0`):
  - `w = 1`: Transition to State F.
  - `w = 0`: Transition to State A.

- State E (output `z = 1`):
  - `w = 1`: Remain in State E.
  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.

- State F (output `z = 1`):
  - `w = 1`: Transition to State C.
  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.

Initial State and Reset Behavior:
- The initial state after reset is State A.
- The reset is synchronous and active-high, meaning it takes effect on the next positive edge of the clock when the reset signal is high.
- State transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Implementation Guidelines:
- Use separate `always` blocks for the state table (combinational logic for state transitions) and state flip-flops (sequential logic for current state storage).
- The FSM output `z` can be described using either continuous assignment statements or an `always` block.
- Assign state codes as desired, ensuring they are consistent throughout the implementation.

Ensure all flip-flops or registers have defined initial values upon reset. Handle edge cases and input boundaries explicitly to maintain predictable behavior.
