Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named `TopModule` will implement a finite state machine (FSM) with the following interface. All input and output ports are single-bit signals unless otherwise specified.\n\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n  - `input w`: Input signal for state transitions.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output z`: Output signal based on the current state.\n\nThe FSM consists of six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F, with state transitions controlled by the input `w`. The output `z` is determined by the current state as follows:\n\n- State A (output `z = 0`):\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State B.\n  - `w = 0`: Remain in State A.\n\n- State B (output `z = 0`):\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State C.\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.\n\n- State C (output `z = 0`):\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State E.\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.\n\n- State D (output `z = 0`):\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State F.\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State A.\n\n- State E (output `z = 1`):\n  - `w = 1`: Remain in State E.\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.\n\n- State F (output `z = 1`):\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State C.\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State D.\n\nInitial State and Reset Behavior:\n- The initial state after reset is State A.\n- The reset is synchronous and active-high, meaning it takes effect on the next positive edge of the clock when the reset signal is high.\n- State transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\nImplementation Guidelines:\n- Use separate `always` blocks for the state table (combinational logic for state transitions) and state flip-flops (sequential logic for current state storage).\n- The FSM output `z` can be described using either continuous assignment statements or an `always` block.\n- Assign state codes as desired, ensuring they are consistent throughout the implementation.\n\nEnsure all flip-flops or registers have defined initial values upon reset. Handle edge cases and input boundaries explicitly to maintain predictable behavior.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specifications for a finite state machine (FSM) with synchronous reset and state transitions based on the input `w`. The FSM is designed with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F, each with specific transitions and outputs. The module uses the following approach:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit `enum` type, which provides a clear and readable way to define state names and their corresponding binary values.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to describe the combinational logic for state transitions. The next state is determined based on the current state and the input `w`, following the transition diagram provided.\n\n3. **State Flip-Flops with Synchronous Reset**: An `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to implement the state register. The synchronous reset ensures that the FSM resets to state A on the next clock edge when the reset signal is high.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined by the current state. A continuous assignment statement is used to set `z` to 1 when the FSM is in states E or F, and 0 otherwise.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all ports and signals, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the FSM operates correctly according to the given state diagram and specifications.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        A = 3'b000,\n        B = 3'b001,\n        C = 3'b010,\n        D = 3'b011,\n        E = 3'b100,\n        F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            A: next_state = w ?
