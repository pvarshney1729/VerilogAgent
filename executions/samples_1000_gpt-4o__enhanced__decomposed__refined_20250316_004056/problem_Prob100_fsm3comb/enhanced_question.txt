Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in`: A single-bit input signal that influences state transitions.
  - `input wire [1:0] state`: A 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the most significant bit, and bit[0] is the least significant bit.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire [1:0] next_state`: A 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the most significant bit, and bit[0] is the least significant bit.
  - `output wire out`: A single-bit output signal produced by the state machine.

Behavioral Specification:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with four states (A, B, C, D) and a single input (`in`).
- State Encoding:
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

- State Transition and Output Logic:
  - Current State: A
    - Next State if `in` = 0: A
    - Next State if `in` = 1: B
    - Output: 0
  - Current State: B
    - Next State if `in` = 0: C
    - Next State if `in` = 1: B
    - Output: 0
  - Current State: C
    - Next State if `in` = 0: A
    - Next State if `in` = 1: D
    - Output: 0
  - Current State: D
    - Next State if `in` = 0: C
    - Next State if `in` = 1: B
    - Output: 1

Operational Details:
- The module strictly implements combinational logic for both state transition and output logic.
- The state transitions and output are determined solely by the current state and input `in`.
- Ensure that the module correctly implements the transitions and outputs as specified in the state transition table without any latches or memory elements.

Note: This specification assumes no reset condition or initial state is required as it exclusively focuses on combinational logic implementation.
