Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1 bit. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `resetn`: Active-low synchronous reset, 1 bit. Resets the FSM to state A when asserted low.\n  - `r`: Request signals, 3 bits, representing `r[2:0]` where `r[0]` is the highest priority and `r[2]` the lowest. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `g`: Grant signals, 3 bits, representing `g[2:0]` where `g[0]` corresponds to the grant for device 0 and `g[2]` for device 2. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFSM Description:\n- Initial State: State A, where no grants are issued (`g = 3'b000`).\n\n- State Transitions:\n  - State A:\n    - Remain in A if `r = 3'b000`.\n    - Transition to B if `r[0] = 1`.\n    - Transition to C if `r[0] = 0` and `r[1] = 1`.\n    - Transition to D if `r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, and `r[2] = 1`.\n  - State B:\n    - Remain in B if `r[0] = 1`.\n    - Transition to A if `r[0] = 0`.\n  - State C:\n    - Remain in C if `r[1] = 1`.\n    - Transition to A if `r[1] = 0`.\n  - State D:\n    - Remain in D if `r[2] = 1`.\n    - Transition to A if `r[2] = 0`.\n\n- State Outputs:\n  - State B: `g[0] = 1`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 0`.\n  - State C: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 1`, `g[2] = 0`.\n  - State D: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 1`.\n  - State A: `g = 3'b000`.\n\n- Priority Scheme: Device 0 has the highest priority, followed by device 1, then device 2. A device is granted resource access only if no higher-priority requests are pending.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic (state table) and state register (flip-flops).\n- Describe the FSM outputs using continuous assignment statements or an always block.\n- Assign state encoding as desired, ensuring clarity and simplicity in implementation.\n- Edge Cases: Ensure correct operation when multiple requests are asserted simultaneously, adhering to the priority scheme.\n                    "

The state transitions are handled in a combinational always block, and the state register is updated in a sequential always block with a synchronous reset. The output logic is also handled in a combinational always block, setting the appropriate grant signals based on the current state. The priority scheme is respected by checking the requests in order of priority in the state A transitions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic [2:0] r,\n    output logic [2:0] g\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State flip-flops with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn)\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (r[0])\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else if (r[1])\n                    next_state = STATE_C;\n                else if (r[2])\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                if (r[0])\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                if (r[1])\n                    next_state = STATE_C;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                if (r[2])\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        g = 3'b000;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_B: g = 3'b001;\n            STATE_C: g = 3'b010;\n            STATE_D: g = 3'b100;\n            default: g = 3'b000;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"

The synchronous reset is implemented by checking `resetn`.

The transitions follow the priority and conditions specified in the problem statement.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: Another combinational always block sets the output `g` based on the `current_state`. Each state sets the corresponding `g[i]` to 1 if the state corresponds to a grant for device `i`.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: Logic types are used for all signals, and the sensitivity list for combinational logic is omitted using `always @(*)`. Numeric constants are sized, and the synchronous reset does not include `resetn` in the sensitivity list.\n</REASONING>"
