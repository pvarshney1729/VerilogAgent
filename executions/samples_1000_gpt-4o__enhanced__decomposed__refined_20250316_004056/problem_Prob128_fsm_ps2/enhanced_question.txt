Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- Input: 
  - clk: 1 bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1 bit, active high synchronous reset.
  - in: 8 bits, input data stream, with bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] as the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output:
  - done: 1 bit, indicates the successful receipt of a complete 3-byte message.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to detect message boundaries within a continuous byte stream using the PS/2 mouse protocol.
- Message Structure: Each message consists of three bytes.
- The start of a message is identified by a byte where in[3] = 1.
- Bytes following the first byte in a message may have any value of in[3].

FSM Operation:
1. Initial State: The FSM discards bytes until it detects a byte with in[3] = 1.
2. Once the FSM identifies such a byte, it considers it to be the first byte of a message.
3. The FSM counts and processes the next two bytes as part of the message.
4. After the third byte of the message is processed, the 'done' signal is asserted high for one clock cycle on the following clock edge.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is active high and synchronous, meaning it affects the FSM state on the next rising edge of the clock when asserted.
- On reset, the FSM returns to its initial state, ready to begin discarding bytes until it finds a new start-of-message byte.

Edge Cases:
- If reset is asserted during message processing, the FSM immediately returns to the initial state, discarding all current progress.
- The FSM assumes a continuous stream of bytes, and any byte with in[3] = 1 is treated as the potential start of a new message.

Clock and Triggering:
- All sequential logic elements within the module are triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
- Ensure all registers used in the FSM have clearly defined initial values upon reset.

The design assumes no race conditions due to the synchronous nature of the FSM, as all state transitions occur on the same clock edge.
