        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPorts:\n- Input: \n  - clk: 1 bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - reset: 1 bit, active high synchronous reset.\n  - in: 8 bits, input data stream, with bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] as the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output:\n  - done: 1 bit, indicates the successful receipt of a complete 3-byte message.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to detect message boundaries within a continuous byte stream using the PS/2 mouse protocol.\n- Message Structure: Each message consists of three bytes.\n- The start of a message is identified by a byte where in[3] = 1.\n- Bytes following the first byte in a message may have any value of in[3].\n\nFSM Operation:\n1. Initial State: The FSM discards bytes until it detects a byte with in[3] = 1.\n2. Once the FSM identifies such a byte, it considers it to be the first byte of a message.\n3. The FSM counts and processes the next two bytes as part of the message.\n4. After the third byte of the message is processed, the 'done' signal is asserted high for one clock cycle on the following clock edge.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is active high and synchronous, meaning it affects the FSM state on the next rising edge of the clock when asserted.\n- On reset, the FSM returns to its initial state, ready to begin discarding bytes until it finds a new start-of-message byte.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If reset is asserted during message processing, the FSM immediately returns to the initial state, discarding all current progress.\n- The FSM assumes a continuous stream of bytes, and any byte with in[3] = 1 is treated as the potential start of a new message.\n\nClock and Triggering:\n- All sequential logic elements within the module are triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.\n- Ensure all registers used in the FSM have clearly defined initial values upon reset.\n\nThe design assumes no race conditions due to the synchronous nature of the FSM, as all state transitions occur on the same clock edge.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a finite state machine (FSM) approach to detect the start and end of a 3-byte message in a PS/2 mouse protocol byte stream. The FSM has four states: `IDLE`, `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `BYTE3`. The `IDLE` state is the initial state where the FSM waits for a byte with `in[3] = 1` to signal the start of a message. Once detected, it transitions to `BYTE1`, then `BYTE2`, and finally `BYTE3`. After processing the third byte, the FSM asserts the `done` signal for one clock cycle and returns to the `IDLE` state to search for the next message. The reset is synchronous and active high, ensuring the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state when reset is asserted. The FSM transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock, adhering to the synchronous design principles.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic [7:0] in,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        IDLE  = 2'b00,\n        BYTE1 = 2'b01,\n        BYTE2 = 2'b10,\n        BYTE3 = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in[3] == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = BYTE1;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            BYTE1: begin\n                next_state = BYTE2;\n            end\n            BYTE2: begin\n                next_state = BYTE3;\n            end\n            BYTE3: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            default: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end else if (current_state == BYTE3) begin\n            done <= 1'b1;\n        end else begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The only indication is that the first byte of each three\nbyte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be\n1 or 0 depending on data).\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine that will search for\nmessage boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll\nuse is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume\nthat this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message\nonce all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in\nthe cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was\nsuccessfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.

The FSM transitions through four states: IDLE, BYTE1, BYTE2, and BYTE3. The IDLE state waits for a byte with in[3] = 1, indicating the start of a message. Once detected, the FSM transitions through BYTE1, BYTE2, and BYTE3 states to process the message. The 'done' signal is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte is received, indicating the successful receipt of a complete message. The FSM uses a synchronous reset to return to the IDLE state when reset is high.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic [7:0] in,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        IDLE  = 2'b00,\n        BYTE1 = 2'b01,\n        BYTE2 = 2'b10,\n        BYTE3 = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in[3] == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = BYTE1;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            BYTE1: begin\n                next_state = BYTE2;\n            end\n            BYTE2: begin\n                next_state = BYTE3;\n            end\n            BYTE3: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            default: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end else if (current_state == BYTE3) begin\n            done <= 1'b1;\n        end else begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"
