<REASONING>
To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is a 5-bit vector `q`.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the LFSR to the initial state `00001` when `reset` is high. This ensures that the LFSR starts from a known state and avoids the all-zero state.

3. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the Galois LFSR logic. On each positive edge of the clock, if `reset` is not asserted, the LFSR shifts right. The new value of `q[4]` is determined by XORing the current LSB (`q[0]`) with the bit at the tap position `q[2]`. The rest of the bits shift right unchanged.

4. **Bitwise Operations**: Use bitwise operations to implement the feedback mechanism. The XOR operation is used to determine the new value for the tapped position.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the provided coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

By following these steps, we ensure that the LFSR is correctly implemented and adheres to the specifications provided.
