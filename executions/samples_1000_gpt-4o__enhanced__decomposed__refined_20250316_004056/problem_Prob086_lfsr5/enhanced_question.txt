Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input: `clk` - Clock signal (1 bit)
- Input: `reset` - Active-high synchronous reset (1 bit)
- Output: `q` - 5-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR, with `q[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- The LFSR shifts right with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, corresponding to `q[4]` and `q[2]` respectively.
- On each positive edge of the clock (`clk`), the following operations occur:
  - If `reset` is high, the LFSR is reset to the state `00001` (binary).
  - If `reset` is low, the LFSR shifts right:
    - The new value of `q[4]` is the XOR of the current `q[0]` (LSB) with `q[2]` (tap position).
    - `q[3]`, `q[2]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]` shift right from `q[4]`, `q[3]`, `q[2]`, and `q[1]` respectively.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the LFSR state is set to `00001`, ensuring the LFSR does not enter the all-zero state.

Operational Details:
- The LFSR will cycle through 31 unique states (2^5 - 1), avoiding the all-zero state, as it is a maximal-length configuration.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning the reset state is applied on the next clock edge when `reset` is asserted.

Edge Case Handling:
- The all-zero state is not reachable due to the maximal-length configuration.
- The output `q` is entirely dependent on the initial reset value and the clock-driven sequential logic.

Signal Conventions:
- Bit indexing for `q` is zero-based, where `q[0]` is the LSB and `q[4]` is the MSB.
- All operations are performed based on the positive edge of the clock signal.
