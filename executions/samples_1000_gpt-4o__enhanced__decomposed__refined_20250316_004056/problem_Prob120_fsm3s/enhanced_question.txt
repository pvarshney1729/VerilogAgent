Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input clk`: Clock signal, used to trigger all sequential logic on its positive edge.
- `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal, used to reset the state machine to the initial state (State A).
- `input in`: Single-bit input used for state transitions.
- `output reg out`: Single-bit output, determined by the current state of the state machine.

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- Number of States: Four (A, B, C, D)
- Initial State: State A

State Transition Table:
- State A: 
  - Next State: A if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1
  - Output: 0
- State B:
  - Next State: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1
  - Output: 0
- State C:
  - Next State: A if `in` = 0, D if `in` = 1
  - Output: 0
- State D:
  - Next State: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1
  - Output: 1

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and output updates are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- The `reset` signal, when asserted high, synchronously resets the state machine to State A at the next positive clock edge.

Output Behavior:
- The `out` signal is determined solely by the current state, irrespective of the `in` signal.

Initial Conditions and Conventions:
- On reset, the state machine is set to State A, and the output `out` is set to 0.
- Bit Indexing: All inputs and outputs are single-bit and do not require specific bit indexing.
- Ensure no race conditions by adhering to the specified clock and reset behavior.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The state machine must handle all possible input conditions based on the defined state transition table.
- Ensure that the synchronous reset properly initializes the state machine regardless of the current state or input values.
