The reset logic is included to set the state to A when the reset signal is high.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: We use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module `TopModule` with the given interface. The state machine has four states (A, B, C, D), and transitions between these states depend on the input `in`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, not the input.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We use a 2-bit encoding for the states, allowing us to represent four distinct states. We define these states using an enumerated type `state_t` for clarity and maintainability.\n\n2. **State Register**: We need a state register to hold the current state. This register is updated on the positive edge of the clock. If the `reset` signal is high, the state is reset to `STATE_A`.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: We implement combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `in`. This logic is implemented using a case statement.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. Since this is a Moore machine, the output is independent of the input `in`.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with the clock. Therefore, it is included in the sequential logic block but not in the sensitivity list of the combinational logic.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, as per the guidelines. We use `always @(*)` for combinational logic and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nBy following these steps and adhering to the guidelines and coding conventions, we ensure a correct and efficient implementation of the specified state machine.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state and output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                next_state = (in) ?
