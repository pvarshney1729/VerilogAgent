Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge triggered.
- input wire reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- input wire in: Serial data input.
- output reg done: Output signal indicating successful byte reception.

Functional Specification:
The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial data stream based on a communication protocol that includes:
- 1 start bit (logic 0),
- 8 data bits,
- 1 stop bit (logic 1).

Idle State:
- The serial line remains at logic 1 when idle.

FSM Operation:
1. The FSM initiates when a start bit (logic 0) is detected.
2. After detecting the start bit, the FSM reads the next 8 bits as data bits, with the least significant bit (bit[0]) received first.
3. After reading the 8 data bits, the FSM verifies the presence of a stop bit (logic 1).
4. If the stop bit is detected correctly, the output signal 'done' is asserted high for one clock cycle, indicating successful reception of a byte.
5. If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM disregards the current transmission and waits until a proper stop bit is found before attempting to decode the next byte.

Reset Behavior:
- On the assertion of the reset signal, the FSM returns to its initial state, and the 'done' signal is deasserted to low.

Timing and Triggering:
- All state transitions and signal changes are synchronized to the positive edge of the clock.
- The module assumes that input transitions occur sufficiently away from the clock edges to avoid metastability.

Edge Case Handling:
- The FSM will continuously monitor the input stream and reset its state if a valid stop bit is not detected after 8 data bits.
- The FSM is designed to handle any erroneous data transmissions by waiting for the next valid start bit sequence.

Bit Indexing:
- Indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit received first in the data stream.

The implementation must ensure that no race conditions occur and that the FSM transitions are clearly defined to avoid ambiguous states.
