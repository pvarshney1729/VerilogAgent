<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to decode a serial data stream using a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM is designed to handle a serial communication protocol with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module is implemented with the following considerations:

1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses an enumerated type `state_t` to define its states: `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, `STOP`, and `WAIT_STOP`. This helps in maintaining clarity and readability of the state transitions.

2. **State Register**: A synchronous state register is implemented using an `always @(posedge clk)` block. The state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock. The reset logic is synchronous, meaning the FSM resets to the `IDLE` state when the reset signal is asserted.

3. **Bit Counter**: A 3-bit counter `bit_count` is used to track the number of data bits received. It increments during the `DATA` state and resets in other states.

4. **Next State Logic**: The `always @(*)` block implements the combinational logic for determining the next state based on the current state and input `in`. The transitions are as follows:
   - From `IDLE` to `START` when a start bit (logic 0) is detected.
   - From `START` to `DATA` to begin receiving data bits.
   - From `DATA` to `STOP` after 8 data bits are received.
   - From `STOP` to `IDLE` if a correct stop bit (logic 1) is detected, otherwise to `WAIT_STOP`.
   - From `WAIT_STOP` to `IDLE` when a stop bit is detected.

5. **Output Logic**: The `done` signal is asserted high when a byte is successfully received, i.e., when the FSM is in the `STOP` state and the stop bit is verified.

6. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and ensuring all numeric constants are sized. The synchronous reset is correctly implemented without including `posedge reset` in the sensitivity list.

This structured approach ensures that the FSM correctly identifies and processes the serial data stream according to the specified protocol.
