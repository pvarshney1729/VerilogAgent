Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge triggered.\n- input wire reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- input wire in: Serial data input.\n- output reg done: Output signal indicating successful byte reception.\n\nFunctional Specification:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial data stream based on a communication protocol that includes:\n- 1 start bit (logic 0),\n- 8 data bits,\n- 1 stop bit (logic 1).\n\nIdle State:\n- The serial line remains at logic 1 when idle.\n\nFSM Operation:\n1. The FSM initiates when a start bit (logic 0) is detected.\n2. After detecting the start bit, the FSM reads the next 8 bits as data bits, with the least significant bit (bit[0]) received first.\n3. After reading the 8 data bits, the FSM verifies the presence of a stop bit (logic 1).\n4. If the stop bit is detected correctly, the output signal 'done' is asserted high for one clock cycle, indicating successful reception of a byte.\n5. If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM disregards the current transmission and waits until a proper stop bit is found before attempting to decode the next byte.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On the assertion of the reset signal, the FSM returns to its initial state, and the 'done' signal is deasserted to low.\n\nTiming and Triggering:\n- All state transitions and signal changes are synchronized to the positive edge of the clock.\n- The module assumes that input transitions occur sufficiently away from the clock edges to avoid metastability.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The FSM will continuously monitor the input stream and reset its state if a valid stop bit is not detected after 8 data bits.\n- The FSM is designed to handle any erroneous data transmissions by waiting for the next valid start bit sequence.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit received first in the data stream.\n\nThe implementation must ensure that no race conditions occur and that the FSM transitions are clearly defined to avoid ambiguous states.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to decode a serial data stream using a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM is designed to handle a serial communication protocol with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The module is implemented with the following considerations:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses an enumerated type `state_t` to define its states: `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, `STOP`, and `WAIT_STOP`. This helps in maintaining clarity and readability of the state transitions.\n\n2. **State Register**: A synchronous state register is implemented using an `always @(posedge clk)` block. The state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock. The reset logic is synchronous, meaning the FSM resets to the `IDLE` state when the reset signal is asserted.\n\n3. **Bit Counter**: A 3-bit counter `bit_count` is used to track the number of data bits received. It increments during the `DATA` state and resets in other states.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: The `always @(*)` block implements the combinational logic for determining the next state based on the current state and input `in`. The transitions are as follows:\n   - From `IDLE` to `START` when a start bit (logic 0) is detected.\n   - From `START` to `DATA` to begin receiving data bits.\n   - From `DATA` to `STOP` after 8 data bits are received.\n   - From `STOP` to `IDLE` if a correct stop bit (logic 1) is detected, otherwise to `WAIT_STOP`.\n   - From `WAIT_STOP` to `IDLE` when a stop bit is detected.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The `done` signal is asserted high when a byte is successfully received, i.e., when the FSM is in the `STOP` state and the stop bit is verified.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and ensuring all numeric constants are sized. The synchronous reset is correctly implemented without including `posedge reset` in the sensitivity list.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the FSM correctly identifies and processes the serial data stream according to the specified protocol.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input  logic clk,\n    input  logic reset,\n    input  logic in,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE      = 3'b000,\n        START     = 3'b001,\n        DATA      = 3'b010,\n        STOP      = 3'b011,\n        WAIT_STOP = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] bit_count;\n\n    // State register with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            bit_count <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == DATA) begin\n                bit_count <= bit_count + 1;\n            end else begin\n                bit_count <= 3'b000;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        done = 1'b0; // Default value\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in == 1'b0) // Detect start bit\n                    next_state = START;\n            end\n\n            START: begin\n                next_state = DATA;\n            end\n\n            DATA: begin\n                if (bit_count == 3'd7) // After 8 data bits\n                    next_state = STOP;\n            end\n\n            STOP: begin\n                if (in == 1'b1) begin // Correct stop bit\n                    done = 1'b1;\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = WAIT_STOP;\n                end\n            end\n\n            WAIT_STOP: begin\n                if (in == 1'b1) // Wait for stop bit\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n\n            default: next_state = IDLE;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
