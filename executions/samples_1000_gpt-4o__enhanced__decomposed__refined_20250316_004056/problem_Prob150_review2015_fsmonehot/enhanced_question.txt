  - `input wire ack;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire [9:0] state;` // 10-bit state input, one-hot encoded

  - `output wire counting;` // 1-bit output logic, active in Count state
  - `output wire shift_ena;` // 1-bit output logic, active in B0, B1, B2, and B3 states

State Encoding:
- One-hot encoded states with 10 bits each:
  - S: 10'b0000000001
  - S1: 10'b0000000010
  - S11: 10'b0000000100
  - S110: 10'b0000001000
  - B0: 10'b0000010000
  - B1: 10'b0000100000
  - B2: 10'b0001000000
  - B3: 10'b0010000000
  - Count: 10'b0100000000
  - Wait: 10'b1000000000

State Machine Description:
- Initial State: At reset, the state machine starts in state "S".
- The state machine is a Moore-type with the following transitions:
  - S: d = 0 leads to S, d = 1 leads to S1
  - S1: d = 0 leads to S, d = 1 leads to S11
  - S11: d = 0 leads to S110, d = 1 leads to S11
  - S110: d = 0 leads to S, d = 1 leads to B0
  - B0: Always transition to B1 (shift_ena = 1)
  - B1: Always transition to B2 (shift_ena = 1)
  - B2: Always transition to B3 (shift_ena = 1)
  - B3: Always transition to Count (shift_ena = 1)
  - Count: done_counting = 0 remains in Count; done_counting = 1 transitions to Wait (counting = 1)
  - Wait: ack = 0 remains in Wait; ack = 1 transitions to S (done = 1)

Output Logic Equations:
- B3_next: Asserted when transitioning to B3 state.
- S_next: Asserted when transitioning to S state.
- S1_next: Asserted when transitioning to S1 state.
- Count_next: Asserted when transitioning to Count state.
- Wait_next: Asserted when transitioning to Wait state.
- done: Asserted in Wait state.
- counting: Asserted in Count state.
- shift_ena: Asserted in B0, B1, B2, and B3 states.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is assumed to be synchronous, setting the initial state to "S" at the start of operation.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure the combinational logic correctly derives the next-state and output logic based on the current state and inputs.
- Avoid race conditions by ensuring all state transitions are based on the stable inputs and current state.
