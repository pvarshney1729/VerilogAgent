<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a Verilog module that represents a Moore state machine with a one-hot encoding for the states. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack`, and the outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are determined by the current state. The module also needs to generate signals for the next state transitions: `B3_next`, `S_next`, `S1_next`, `Count_next`, and `Wait_next`.

1. **State Encoding**: We use a one-hot encoding for the states, where each state is represented by a unique bit position in a 10-bit vector. This simplifies the logic for state transitions and output generation.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The next state is determined based on the current state and the input conditions. We use combinational logic to derive the next state signals (`B3_next`, `S_next`, `S1_next`, `Count_next`, `Wait_next`).

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are determined by the current state. For example, `shift_ena` is asserted in states `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, and `B3`.

4. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, and the combinational logic is implemented using `always @(*)` blocks. We adhere to the specified interface and signal names.

5. **Synchronous Reset**: Although not explicitly required in the combinational logic portion, the reset logic would typically initialize the state to `S` in a complete design.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specifications and coding conventions provided.
