Module Specification:

Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.
  - reset: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset signal. When high, the FSM resets to state 000 on the next clock edge.
  - x: 1-bit control input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output signal.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- State Encoding: The FSM uses a 3-bit state register y[2:0] to represent states, with bit[2] as the most significant bit and bit[0] as the least significant bit.
- Initial State: On reset, the FSM transitions to state 000.
- State Transitions: The state transitions are determined by the current state y[2:0] and input x as follows:
  - Present State 000:
    - If x = 0, next state = 000
    - If x = 1, next state = 001
  - Present State 001:
    - If x = 0, next state = 001
    - If x = 1, next state = 100
  - Present State 010:
    - If x = 0, next state = 010
    - If x = 1, next state = 001
  - Present State 011:
    - If x = 0, next state = 001
    - If x = 1, next state = 010
  - Present State 100:
    - If x = 0, next state = 011
    - If x = 1, next state = 100

- Output Logic: The output z is determined by the present state as follows:
  - z = 0 for states 000, 001, 010
  - z = 1 for states 011, 100

Operational Details:
- The FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, meaning the FSM will transition to the initial state 000 on the next clock cycle when reset is asserted.
- All state transitions and output determinations occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the reset signal is deasserted before observing normal state transitions.
- If the reset is asserted, the state immediately transitions to 000 on the next positive clock edge, regardless of the input x.

This specification ensures clarity in implementation and defines all necessary conditions for correct behavior of the FSM in the TopModule.
