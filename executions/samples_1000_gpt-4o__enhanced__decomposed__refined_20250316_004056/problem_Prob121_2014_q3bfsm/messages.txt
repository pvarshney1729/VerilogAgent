The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - reset: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset signal. When high, the FSM resets to state 000 on the next clock edge.\n  - x: 1-bit control input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - z: 1-bit output signal.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- State Encoding: The FSM uses a 3-bit state register y[2:0] to represent states, with bit[2] as the most significant bit and bit[0] as the least significant bit.\n- Initial State: On reset, the FSM transitions to state 000.\n- State Transitions: The state transitions are determined by the current state y[2:0] and input x as follows:\n  - Present State 000:\n    - If x = 0, next state = 000\n    - If x = 1, next state = 001\n  - Present State 001:\n    - If x = 0, next state = 001\n    - If x = 1, next state = 100\n  - Present State 010:\n    - If x = 0, next state = 010\n    - If x = 1, next state = 001\n  - Present State 011:\n    - If x = 0, next state = 001\n    - If x = 1, next state = 010\n  - Present State 100:\n    - If x = 0, next state = 011\n    - If x = 1, next state = 100\n\n- Output Logic: The output z is determined by the present state as follows:\n  - z = 0 for states 000, 001, 010\n  - z = 1 for states 011, 100\n\nOperational Details:\n- The FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, meaning the FSM will transition to the initial state 000 on the next clock cycle when reset is asserted.\n- All state transitions and output determinations occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the reset signal is deasserted before observing normal state transitions.\n- If the reset is asserted, the state immediately transitions to 000 on the next positive clock edge, regardless of the input x.\n\nThis specification ensures clarity in implementation and defines all necessary conditions for correct behavior of the FSM in the TopModule.\n                    "

The FSM transitions between states based on the input `x`, and the output `z` is determined by the current state. The state transitions and output logic are defined in the state table provided.\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `reset`, `x`, and output `z`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **State Register**: We declare a 3-bit `logic` vector `state` to hold the current state and `next_state` to hold the next state. The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n3. **Synchronous Reset**: The state register is reset to `000` when the `reset` signal is high on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: We use a combinational `always @(*)` block to determine the `next_state` based on the current `state` and input `x`. The state transitions are implemented as per the state table.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined based on the current `state` using the same combinational block. The output values are assigned according to the state table.\n\n6. **Default Case**: A default case is included to handle unexpected states, ensuring the FSM returns to the initial state `000` and sets `z` to `0`.\n\nThis implementation follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring correct behavior of the FSM.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    logic [2:0] state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            state <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state and output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            3'b000: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b000 : 3'b001;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n            3'b001: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b100;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n            3'b010: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b010 : 3'b001;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n            3'b011: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b010;\n                z = 1'b1;\n            end\n            3'b100: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b011 : 3'b100;\n                z = 1'b1;\n            end\n            default: begin\n                next_state = 3'b000;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is designed to implement a finite-state machine (FSM) with a synchronous active-high reset. The FSM transitions between states based on the input `x` and outputs `z` according to the specified state table.\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `reset`, `x`, and output `z`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **State Register**: The current state `state` and the next state `next_state` are declared as 3-bit `logic` vectors. This is necessary to represent the five possible states (000, 001, 010, 011, 100).\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: An `always` block is used to update the state on the positive edge of the clock. If `reset` is high, the state is set to 000. Otherwise, the state transitions to `next_state`.\n\n4. **Next State and Output Logic**: Another `always @(*)` block is used to determine the `next_state` and output `z` based on the current `state` and input `x`. This block implements the state transition table and output logic provided in the specification.\n\n5. **Default Case**: A default case is included to handle any unexpected states, ensuring the FSM returns to state 000 and outputs `z = 0`.\n\nThe implementation ensures that all logic is synchronous with the clock, and the reset is handled synchronously as specified.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    logic [2:0] state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            state <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state and output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            3'b000: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b000 : 3'b001;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n            3'b001: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b100;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n            3'b010: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b010 : 3'b001;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n            3'b011: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b010;\n                z = 1'b1;\n            end\n            3'b100: begin\n                next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b011 : 3'b100;\n                z = 1'b1;\n            end\n            default: begin\n                next_state = 3'b000;\n                z = 1'b0;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
