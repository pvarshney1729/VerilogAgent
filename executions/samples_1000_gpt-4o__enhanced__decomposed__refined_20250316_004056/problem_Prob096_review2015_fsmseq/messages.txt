Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire clk: Clock signal for the module. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - input wire reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When high, all state registers are reset to their initial state on the next positive clock edge.\n  - input wire data: Input bit stream for the finite-state machine (FSM) to process.\n- Output Ports:\n  - output reg start_shifting: Output signal that is set to 1 when the sequence 1101 is detected in the input stream and remains 1 until a reset occurs.\n\nFSM Description:\n- The FSM is designed to detect the sequence \"1101\" within a continuous input bit stream provided by 'data'.\n- The FSM consists of multiple states, each representing a partial or complete detection of the target sequence:\n  1. STATE_0: Initial state, no bits of the sequence detected.\n  2. STATE_1: First '1' of the sequence detected.\n  3. STATE_11: Two sequential '1's detected.\n  4. STATE_110: Sequence \"110\" detected.\n  5. STATE_1101: Sequence \"1101\" fully detected.\n\nOperation:\n- Transition between states occurs on the positive edge of 'clk'.\n- The state transitions are as follows:\n  - From STATE_0 to STATE_1 on receiving '1'.\n  - From STATE_1 to STATE_11 on receiving another '1'.\n  - From STATE_11 to STATE_110 on receiving '0'.\n  - From STATE_110 to STATE_1101 on receiving '1'.\n  - Remain in STATE_1101 once the sequence is detected until reset.\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- The output 'start_shifting' is set to 1 when the FSM enters STATE_1101.\n- 'start_shifting' remains 1 until the 'reset' signal is activated.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon activation of 'reset', the FSM returns to STATE_0, and 'start_shifting' is reset to 0 on the next positive clock edge.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM correctly handles overlapping sequences and resets appropriately upon detecting the sequence or receiving a reset signal.\n- All transitions and state assignments are synchronous with the clock signal and respect the active-high reset.\n\nNote:\n- All bit indices refer to the least significant bit (LSB) position as bit[0].\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is designed to detect the sequence \"1101\" in an input bit stream using a finite-state machine (FSM). The FSM transitions through states based on the input data, and once the sequence is detected, the output `start_shifting` is set to 1 and remains 1 until a reset occurs.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses a 3-bit state encoding to represent five states: IDLE, S1, S11, S110, and S1101. These states correspond to the detection of the sequence \"1101\".\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The state transition logic is implemented in an `always @(posedge clk)` block. This block updates the current state based on the next state and sets `start_shifting` to 1 when the FSM reaches the S1101 state. The reset logic is synchronous, meaning the state and output are reset on the next positive clock edge when `reset` is high.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented using an `always @(*)` block. This block determines the next state based on the current state and input data. The FSM transitions through the states as follows:\n   - From IDLE to S1 on receiving '1'.\n   - From S1 to S11 on receiving another '1'.\n   - From S11 to S110 on receiving '0'.\n   - From S110 to S1101 on receiving '1'.\n   - Remains in S1101 once the sequence is detected.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `start_shifting` is set to 1 when the FSM enters the S1101 state and remains 1 until reset. This is achieved by checking the current state in the state transition logic.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring synchronous reset without including `reset` in the sensitivity list of sequential blocks.\n\nOverall, the implementation is designed to be efficient and follows best practices for FSM design in Verilog.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    output logic start_shifting\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE    = 3'b000,\n        S1      = 3'b001,\n        S11     = 3'b010,\n        S110    = 3'b011,\n        S1101   = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            start_shifting <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == S1101) begin\n                start_shifting <= 1'b1;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (data)\n                    next_state = S1;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            S1: begin\n                if (data)\n                    next_state = S11;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            S11: begin\n                if (data)\n                    next_state = S11;\n                else\n                    next_state = S110;\n            end\n            S110: begin\n                if (data)\n                    next_state = S1101;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            S1101: begin\n                next_state = S1101; // Remain in S1101 once sequence is detected\n            end\n            default: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
