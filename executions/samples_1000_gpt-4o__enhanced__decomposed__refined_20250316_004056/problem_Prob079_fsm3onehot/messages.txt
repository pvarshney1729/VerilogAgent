        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. The interface is defined as follows:\n\n- **Input Ports:**\n  - `input wire in`: A 1-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire [3:0] state`: A 4-bit input signal representing the current state using one-hot encoding.\n\n- **Output Ports:**\n  - `output wire [3:0] next_state`: A 4-bit output signal to represent the next state using one-hot encoding.\n  - `output wire out`: A 1-bit output signal.\n\n### State Machine Specifications\n\nThe state machine is a Moore type with one input (`in`), one output (`out`), and four distinct states. The state encoding uses a one-hot scheme as follows:\n- State A is encoded as `4'b0001`\n- State B is encoded as `4'b0010`\n- State C is encoded as `4'b0100`\n- State D is encoded as `4'b1000`\n\n#### State Transition Table\nThe state transitions and outputs are defined by the following table:\n\n| Current State | `in` = 0 | `in` = 1 | Output |\n|---------------|----------|----------|--------|\n| A (0001)      | A (0001) | B (0010) | 0      |\n| B (0010)      | C (0100) | B (0010) | 0      |\n| C (0100)      | A (0001) | D (1000) | 0      |\n| D (1000)      | C (0100) | B (0010) | 1      |\n\n### Combinational Logic\n\n- **State Transition Logic:** \n  The next state is determined based on the current state and the input `in`. The logic should be implemented using combinational logic to derive the `next_state` from the `state` and `in` signals.\n\n- **Output Logic:** \n  The output `out` is determined solely by the current state. The output logic must also be implemented as combinational logic.\n\n### Additional Implementation Details\n\n- **Bit Indexing:** \n  - The encoding uses bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] as the most significant bit (MSB).\n  \n- **Operational Constraints:** \n  - The design should ensure that only one bit in the `state` and `next_state` signals is set at any time (one-hot encoding).\n  - All logic must be purely combinational without any sequential elements, as the specification focuses exclusively on the state transition and output logic.\n\nEdge cases, such as invalid state encodings, are not to be handled within the module, as the design assumes valid one-hot encoded states are always provided.\n                    "
