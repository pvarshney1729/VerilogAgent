Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input  wire clk: Clock signal, active on the positive edge.\n- input  wire reset: Active high synchronous reset.\n- input  wire in: Input data stream, 1-bit.\n- output reg disc: Output signal, indicates a bit needs to be discarded, 1-bit.\n- output reg flag: Output signal, indicates detection of a frame boundary flag, 1-bit.\n- output reg err: Output signal, indicates an error condition, 1-bit.\n\nPort Widths and Conventions:\n- All ports are 1-bit wide.\n- Input 'in' is a 1-bit continuous bit stream.\n- Outputs 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' will be asserted for one clock cycle when their respective conditions are met.\n\nFinite State Machine Specification:\n- Type: Moore-type FSM.\n- Initial State: Upon reset, the FSM should act as if the previous input was '0'.\n- State Transition: Triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\nFlag Detection:\n1. Sequence \"0111110\": \n   - FSM should transition to a state where 'disc' is asserted for one clock cycle to discard the zero following five consecutive '1's.\n2. Sequence \"01111110\":\n   - FSM should transition to a state where 'flag' is asserted for one clock cycle, indicating a frame boundary.\n3. Sequence \"01111111...\":\n   - FSM should transition to a state where 'err' is asserted for one clock cycle if seven or more consecutive '1's are detected.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous (active high) and returns the FSM to the initial state.\n- Upon reset, outputs 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' should be de-asserted (set to 0).\n\nInput Boundaries and Edge Cases:\n- The FSM should handle continuous stream inputs and reset correctly to process subsequent bit patterns.\n- No race conditions should occur as the design is based on a Moore FSM, where outputs depend solely on the current state.\n\nOutput Assertion:\n- Outputs 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' are asserted for the entire clock cycle following the detection of their respective conditions.\n- Outputs are cleared on the next clock cycle unless conditions for assertion are met again.\n\nClock and Timing:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Ensure that the FSM transitions and output assertions adhere to the specified clock cycle behavior.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is designed to detect specific sequences in a continuous bit stream using a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM). The FSM transitions between states based on the input bit stream and asserts the appropriate output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) based on the detected sequence.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses a 3-bit state encoding to represent the number of consecutive '1's detected. The states range from `S0` (no '1's) to `S7` (7 or more consecutive '1's, indicating an error).\n\n2. **State Register**: The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock. A synchronous reset is implemented to reset the FSM to the `S0` state, simulating the condition where the previous input was '0'.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented using a combinational `always_comb` block. The FSM transitions to the next state based on the current state and the input bit. For example, if the FSM is in state `S5` and receives a '1', it transitions to `S6`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output logic is also implemented using a combinational `always_comb` block. The outputs are asserted based on the current state:\n   - `disc` is asserted when the FSM detects the sequence \"0111110\".\n   - `flag` is asserted when the FSM detects the sequence \"01111110\".\n   - `err` is asserted when the FSM detects 7 or more consecutive '1's.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and `always_comb` for combinational logic. The FSM is implemented using a `typedef` for state encoding, ensuring clarity and maintainability.\n\nOverall, the module is designed to accurately detect the specified sequences in the input bit stream and assert the corresponding output signals for one clock cycle after the sequence is detected.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic disc,\n    output logic flag,\n    output logic err\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        S0 = 3'b000,  // Initial state, equivalent to 0 previous 1s\n        S1 = 3'b001,  // 1 consecutive 1\n        S2 = 3'b010,  // 2 consecutive 1s\n        S3 = 3'b011,  // 3 consecutive 1s\n        S4 = 3'b100,  // 4 consecutive 1s\n        S5 = 3'b101,  // 5 consecutive 1s\n        S6 = 3'b110,  // 6 consecutive 1s\n        S7 = 3'b111   // 7 or more consecutive 1s (error state)\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State register with synchronous reset\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= S0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            S0: next_state = (in) ?
