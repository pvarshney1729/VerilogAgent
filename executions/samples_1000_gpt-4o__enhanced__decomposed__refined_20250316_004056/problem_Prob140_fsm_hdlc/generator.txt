<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to detect specific patterns in a bit stream. The FSM transitions through states based on the number of consecutive '1's detected in the input stream. The states are encoded using a 3-bit logic vector, allowing for up to 8 states, which is sufficient for our needs.

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded as follows:
   - `S0`: Initial state, no consecutive '1's detected.
   - `S1` to `S6`: States representing 1 to 6 consecutive '1's.
   - `S7`: Error state, representing 7 or more consecutive '1's.

2. **State Register**: The state register updates on the positive edge of the clock. If the reset signal is high, the FSM resets to the `S0` state. Otherwise, it transitions to the next state as determined by the input and current state.

3. **Next State Logic**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input bit. If the input is '1', the FSM moves to the next state representing an additional consecutive '1'. If the input is '0', the FSM resets to `S0`, except in specific conditions where outputs are asserted.

4. **Output Logic**: The outputs are determined solely by the current state:
   - `disc` is asserted when the FSM detects the pattern `0111110`, indicating a zero should be discarded.
   - `flag` is asserted when the FSM detects the pattern `01111110`, indicating a frame boundary.
   - `err` is asserted when the FSM detects 7 or more consecutive '1's, indicating an error.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and employing `always_ff` and `always_comb` for sequential and combinational logic, respectively. The reset is synchronous, and the FSM is designed to handle continuous input streams efficiently.
