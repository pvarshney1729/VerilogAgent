Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input  wire clk: Clock signal, active on the positive edge.
- input  wire reset: Active high synchronous reset.
- input  wire in: Input data stream, 1-bit.
- output reg disc: Output signal, indicates a bit needs to be discarded, 1-bit.
- output reg flag: Output signal, indicates detection of a frame boundary flag, 1-bit.
- output reg err: Output signal, indicates an error condition, 1-bit.

Port Widths and Conventions:
- All ports are 1-bit wide.
- Input 'in' is a 1-bit continuous bit stream.
- Outputs 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' will be asserted for one clock cycle when their respective conditions are met.

Finite State Machine Specification:
- Type: Moore-type FSM.
- Initial State: Upon reset, the FSM should act as if the previous input was '0'.
- State Transition: Triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Flag Detection:
1. Sequence "0111110": 
   - FSM should transition to a state where 'disc' is asserted for one clock cycle to discard the zero following five consecutive '1's.
2. Sequence "01111110":
   - FSM should transition to a state where 'flag' is asserted for one clock cycle, indicating a frame boundary.
3. Sequence "01111111...":
   - FSM should transition to a state where 'err' is asserted for one clock cycle if seven or more consecutive '1's are detected.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous (active high) and returns the FSM to the initial state.
- Upon reset, outputs 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' should be de-asserted (set to 0).

Input Boundaries and Edge Cases:
- The FSM should handle continuous stream inputs and reset correctly to process subsequent bit patterns.
- No race conditions should occur as the design is based on a Moore FSM, where outputs depend solely on the current state.

Output Assertion:
- Outputs 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' are asserted for the entire clock cycle following the detection of their respective conditions.
- Outputs are cleared on the next clock cycle unless conditions for assertion are met again.

Clock and Timing:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
- Ensure that the FSM transitions and output assertions adhere to the specified clock cycle behavior.
