Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input  logic clk, // Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input  logic reset, // Synchronous reset, active high.
- input  logic s, // Input signal used only in state A.
- input  logic w, // Input signal used for determining state transitions in state B.
- output logic z // Output signal that is set based on FSM conditions.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Overview:
- The FSM comprises two states, A and B.
- State A is the initial state upon reset.

State Descriptions:
1. State A:
   - If s = 0, remain in State A.
   - If s = 1, transition to State B on the next positive clock edge.
   - The output z is irrelevant in this state and should be set to 0.

2. State B:
   - In this state, the FSM monitors the input w over the next three consecutive clock cycles.
   - A counter (3-bit wide) tracks the number of cycles where w = 1.
   - If w = 1 in exactly two of these three cycles, set z = 1 in the subsequent clock cycle.
   - If not, set z = 0 in the subsequent clock cycle.
   - After evaluating w for three cycles, continue monitoring for the next three cycles without transitioning back to State A.

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- All state transitions and operations occur on the positive edge of the clock.
- The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning the FSM will return to State A when reset = 1 on the positive edge of the clock.
- Upon reset, all FSM state indicators and counters are initialized to 0.

Bit Indexing:
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit values.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit if any multi-bit signals or counters are introduced.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure the counter resets correctly after each three-cycle evaluation in state B.
- Handle transitions and outputs correctly at every clock edge following the specified conditions.
