Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input  logic clk, // Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- input  logic reset, // Synchronous reset, active high.\n- input  logic s, // Input signal used only in state A.\n- input  logic w, // Input signal used for determining state transitions in state B.\n- output logic z // Output signal that is set based on FSM conditions.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Overview:\n- The FSM comprises two states, A and B.\n- State A is the initial state upon reset.\n\nState Descriptions:\n1. State A:\n   - If s = 0, remain in State A.\n   - If s = 1, transition to State B on the next positive clock edge.\n   - The output z is irrelevant in this state and should be set to 0.\n\n2. State B:\n   - In this state, the FSM monitors the input w over the next three consecutive clock cycles.\n   - A counter (3-bit wide) tracks the number of cycles where w = 1.\n   - If w = 1 in exactly two of these three cycles, set z = 1 in the subsequent clock cycle.\n   - If not, set z = 0 in the subsequent clock cycle.\n   - After evaluating w for three cycles, continue monitoring for the next three cycles without transitioning back to State A.\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- All state transitions and operations occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n- The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning the FSM will return to State A when reset = 1 on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Upon reset, all FSM state indicators and counters are initialized to 0.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All inputs and outputs are single-bit values.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit if any multi-bit signals or counters are introduced.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure the counter resets correctly after each three-cycle evaluation in state B.\n- Handle transitions and outputs correctly at every clock edge following the specified conditions.\n                    "

The module starts in STATE_A and transitions to STATE_B when the input `s` is 1. In STATE_B, the module monitors the input `w` over three clock cycles. A counter `w_count` tracks the number of times `w` is 1 during these cycles. If `w` is 1 exactly twice, the output `z` is set to 1; otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The `cycle_count` counter ensures the FSM evaluates `w` for exactly three cycles before resetting the counters and continuing the evaluation. The synchronous reset ensures the FSM starts in STATE_A with all counters and outputs initialized to 0.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic s,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [0:0] {\n        STATE_A = 1'b0,\n        STATE_B = 1'b1\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] cycle_count; // Counter for the number of cycles in state B\n    logic [1:0] w_count;     // Counter for the number of times w is 1\n\n    // State register with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            cycle_count <= 2'b00;\n            w_count <= 2'b00;\n            z <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == STATE_B) begin\n                if (cycle_count < 2'b11) begin\n                    cycle_count <= cycle_count + 1;\n                    if (w) begin\n                        w_count <= w_count + 1;\n                    end\n                end else begin\n                    cycle_count <= 2'b00;\n                    if (w_count == 2'b10) begin\n                        z <= 1'b1;\n                    end else begin\n                        z <= 1'b0;\n                    end\n                    w_count <= 2'b00;\n                end\n            end else begin\n                z <= 1'b0;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (s) next_state = STATE_B;\n                else next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                next_state = STATE_B; // Remain in STATE_B\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"
