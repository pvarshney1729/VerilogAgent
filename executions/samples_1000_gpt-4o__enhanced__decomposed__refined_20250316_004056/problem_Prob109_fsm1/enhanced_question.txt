Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal for the module. This signal is used to synchronize state transitions. Active on the rising edge.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal. When high, the module resets the state to the initial state, B.
  - `input in`: Input signal to determine state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - `output out`: Output signal that reflects the current state. 1 when the module is in state B, 0 when in state A.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states, A and B.
  - State A: The output `out` is 0.
  - State B: The output `out` is 1.

State Transition Diagram:
- State B (output = 1)
  - Transition to State A on input `in` = 0
  - Remain in State B on input `in` = 1

- State A (output = 0)
  - Transition to State B on input `in` = 0
  - Remain in State A on input `in` = 1

Reset Behavior:
- The `areset` signal is an asynchronous reset.
- When `areset` is high, the module immediately transitions to state B, regardless of the clock signal.
- Upon release of `areset`, the module resumes normal operation governed by the clock signal.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up or reset (`areset` high), the module is in state B and the output `out` is 1.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal when the `areset` signal is not asserted.
- The module should handle all input combinations and edge cases, ensuring deterministic behavior as specified.
