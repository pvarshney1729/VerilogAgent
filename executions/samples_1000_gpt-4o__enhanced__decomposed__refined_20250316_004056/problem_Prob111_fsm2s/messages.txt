Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module `TopModule` is a digital logic circuit that implements a Moore state machine with two states and one output. The interface is defined as follows:\n\n- `input clk`: The clock signal, used for synchronizing the state transitions within the state machine.\n- `input reset`: An active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted (logic high) on the rising edge of the clock, the state machine resets to the initial state `OFF`.\n- `input j`: An input signal that influences state transitions when the current state is `OFF`.\n- `input k`: An input signal that influences state transitions when the current state is `ON`.\n- `output out`: The output signal, which reflects the current state of the state machine.\n\nPort Naming and Widths:\n- All ports are 1-bit wide.\n- The naming convention is lowercase for input and output signals.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The state machine consists of two states: `OFF` and `ON`.\n- The initial state after reset is `OFF`.\n\nState Transition Conditions:\n1. State `OFF` (Output `out=0`):\n   - If `j=0`, remain in state `OFF`.\n   - If `j=1`, transition to state `ON`.\n\n2. State `ON` (Output `out=1`):\n   - If `k=0`, remain in state `ON`.\n   - If `k=1`, transition to state `OFF`.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous and active-high.\n- When `reset` is high at the rising edge of `clk`, the state machine will transition to state `OFF`.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On reset, the state is initialized to `OFF` and the output `out` is set to `0`.\n\nSignal and Operation Precedence:\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n- The reset signal has priority over input signals `j` and `k` during a clock cycle.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that `j` and `k` signals are stable before the rising edge of the `clk` to avoid unintended state transitions.\n- The state transition conditions are designed to avoid race conditions by ensuring only stable state transitions occur per the Moore state machine design.\n\nThe above specification ensures the correct and unambiguous implementation of the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine.\n                    "

This provides clarity and ensures that the states are represented as single-bit logic values.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: An `always` block triggered on the rising edge of `clk` is used to implement the synchronous state transition. The `reset` signal is checked first to ensure that the state machine resets to `OFF` when `reset` is high.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: Another `always` block with `always @(*)` is used to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`. This block is purely combinational.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. This is implemented using a combinational `always` block. The output is `0` in the `OFF` state and `1` in the `ON` state.\n\n6. **Default Cases**: Default cases are provided in both the next state and output logic to handle any unforeseen conditions, ensuring the state machine is robust.\n\nThe implementation strictly follows the conventions and ensures that the state transitions and output logic are correctly implemented as per the Moore state machine specification.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic {\n        OFF = 1'b0,\n        ON  = 1'b1\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= OFF;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            OFF: begin\n                if (j)\n                    next_state = ON;\n                else\n                    next_state = OFF;\n            end\n            ON: begin\n                if (k)\n                    next_state = OFF;\n                else\n                    next_state = ON;\n            end\n            default: next_state = OFF;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            OFF: out = 1'b0;\n            ON:  out = 1'b1;\n            default: out = 1'b0;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define two states, `OFF` and `ON`, using an enumerated type `state_t`. Each state is represented by a single bit: `OFF` is `0` and `ON` is `1`.\n\n2. **State Register**: We declare `current_state` and `next_state` as variables of type `state_t`. The `current_state` holds the present state of the machine, while `next_state` is used to determine the upcoming state based on the current state and inputs.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always @(posedge clk)` block to implement synchronous state transitions. If `reset` is high, the state machine resets to `OFF`. Otherwise, it transitions to `next_state` on each rising edge of `clk`.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: We use an `always @(*)` block to determine `next_state` based on `current_state` and inputs `j` and `k`. The transitions are defined as:\n   - From `OFF`, if `j` is `1`, transition to `ON`; otherwise, stay in `OFF`.\n   - From `ON`, if `k` is `1`, transition to `OFF`; otherwise, stay in `ON`.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: We use another `always @(*)` block to set the output `out` based on `current_state`. In a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state:\n   - In `OFF`, `out` is `0`.\n   - In `ON`, `out` is `1`.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, employing `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring synchronous reset is implemented correctly without including `reset` in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure the module behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output logic.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic {\n        OFF = 1'b0,\n        ON  = 1'b1\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= OFF;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            OFF: begin\n                if (j)\n                    next_state = ON;\n                else\n                    next_state = OFF;\n            end\n            ON: begin\n                if (k)\n                    next_state = OFF;\n                else\n                    next_state = ON;\n            end\n            default: next_state = OFF;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            OFF: out = 1'b0;\n            ON:  out = 1'b1;\n            default: out = 1'b0;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
