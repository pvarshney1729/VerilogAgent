<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module `TopModule` is a digital logic circuit that implements a Moore state machine with two states and one output. The interface is defined as follows:

- `input clk`: The clock signal, used for synchronizing the state transitions within the state machine.
- `input reset`: An active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted (logic high) on the rising edge of the clock, the state machine resets to the initial state `OFF`.
- `input j`: An input signal that influences state transitions when the current state is `OFF`.
- `input k`: An input signal that influences state transitions when the current state is `ON`.
- `output out`: The output signal, which reflects the current state of the state machine.

Port Naming and Widths:
- All ports are 1-bit wide.
- The naming convention is lowercase for input and output signals.

State Machine Description:
- The state machine consists of two states: `OFF` and `ON`.
- The initial state after reset is `OFF`.

State Transition Conditions:
1. State `OFF` (Output `out=0`):
   - If `j=0`, remain in state `OFF`.
   - If `j=1`, transition to state `ON`.

2. State `ON` (Output `out=1`):
   - If `k=0`, remain in state `ON`.
   - If `k=1`, transition to state `OFF`.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and active-high.
- When `reset` is high at the rising edge of `clk`, the state machine will transition to state `OFF`.

Initial Conditions:
- On reset, the state is initialized to `OFF` and the output `out` is set to `0`.

Signal and Operation Precedence:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk`.
- The reset signal has priority over input signals `j` and `k` during a clock cycle.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that `j` and `k` signals are stable before the rising edge of the `clk` to avoid unintended state transitions.
- The state transition conditions are designed to avoid race conditions by ensuring only stable state transitions occur per the Moore state machine design.

The above specification ensures the correct and unambiguous implementation of the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine.
