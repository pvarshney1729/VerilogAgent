<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we follow these steps:

1. **State Encoding**: We define two states, `OFF` and `ON`, using an enumerated type `state_t`. Each state is represented by a single bit: `OFF` is `0` and `ON` is `1`.

2. **State Register**: We declare `current_state` and `next_state` as variables of type `state_t`. The `current_state` holds the present state of the machine, while `next_state` is used to determine the upcoming state based on the current state and inputs.

3. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always @(posedge clk)` block to implement synchronous state transitions. If `reset` is high, the state machine resets to `OFF`. Otherwise, it transitions to `next_state` on each rising edge of `clk`.

4. **Next State Logic**: We use an `always @(*)` block to determine `next_state` based on `current_state` and inputs `j` and `k`. The transitions are defined as:
   - From `OFF`, if `j` is `1`, transition to `ON`; otherwise, stay in `OFF`.
   - From `ON`, if `k` is `1`, transition to `OFF`; otherwise, stay in `ON`.

5. **Output Logic**: We use another `always @(*)` block to set the output `out` based on `current_state`. In a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state:
   - In `OFF`, `out` is `0`.
   - In `ON`, `out` is `1`.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, employing `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring synchronous reset is implemented correctly without including `reset` in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.

By following these steps, we ensure the module behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output logic.
