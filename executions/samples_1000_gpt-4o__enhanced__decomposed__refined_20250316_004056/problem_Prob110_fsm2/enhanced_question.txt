Module: TopModule

Interface:
- Input:  clk (Clock signal, 1 bit)
- Input:  areset (Asynchronous reset, active-high, 1 bit)
- Input:  j (State transition input, 1 bit)
- Input:  k (State transition input, 1 bit)
- Output: out (State output, 1 bit)

Specification:
1. The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
2. The state transition is determined by the inputs j and k.
3. The reset (areset) is an active-high asynchronous reset that sets the state to OFF.
4. The state machine outputs 0 in the OFF state and 1 in the ON state.

State Definitions:
- OFF State: 
  - Output (out): 0
  - Transition: 
    - If j == 0, stay in OFF.
    - If j == 1, transition to ON.
- ON State:
  - Output (out): 1
  - Transition:
    - If k == 0, stay in ON.
    - If k == 1, transition to OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- When areset is high, the state machine transitions to the OFF state immediately, regardless of the clock.

Clocking:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up, the module initializes to the OFF state.

MSB/LSB Conventions:
- bit[0] refers to the least significant bit for single-bit inputs and outputs.
