<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and conventions provided. The module is designed as a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` is determined solely by the current state.

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a single-bit logic type, with OFF represented as `1'b0` and ON as `1'b1`.

2. **State Register**: The state register is implemented using an `always_ff` block with an asynchronous reset. The reset is active-high and immediately sets the state to OFF when asserted.

3. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented using an `always_comb` block. A `case` statement is used to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output logic is also implemented using an `always_comb` block. The output `out` is set based on the current state, with OFF producing an output of `0` and ON producing an output of `1`.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all ports and signals, and `always_comb` for combinational logic without explicitly specifying the sensitivity list.

6. **Safety Defaults**: Default cases are included in both the next state and output logic to handle unexpected states, ensuring robust operation.

The implementation ensures that the state transitions and outputs occur as specified in the state diagram, with the asynchronous reset correctly initializing the state to OFF.
