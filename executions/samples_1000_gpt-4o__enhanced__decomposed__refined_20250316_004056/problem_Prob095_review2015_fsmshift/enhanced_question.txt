Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: `clk` (1 bit) - Clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
- Input: `reset` (1 bit) - Active-high synchronous reset. When asserted, the FSM will reset and follow the reset behavior described below.
- Output: `shift_ena` (1 bit) - Signal to enable the shift register.

Functional Description:
1. The module is part of a finite state machine (FSM) that controls a shift register.
2. The FSM should enable the `shift_ena` signal for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles upon detecting a specific bit pattern (pattern detection logic is assumed to be external and not part of this specification).
3. Upon a synchronous reset (`reset` asserted high), `shift_ena` should be asserted (set to 1) for 4 consecutive clock cycles, regardless of other conditions. After these 4 cycles, `shift_ena` should be deasserted (set to 0) indefinitely until another reset occurs.
4. Ensure that after a reset, the FSM starts counting the 4 cycles from the next positive edge of the clock.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and active high.
- Upon reset, the FSM should initialize such that it starts counting the 4 clock cycles from the next positive edge of the clock.
- After 4 cycles of `shift_ena` being high, it should transition to low (0) and remain low until the next reset.

Implementation Notes:
- Bit [0] refers to the least significant bit in any multi-bit signals.
- All registers and flip-flops used in this module should be initialized to a known state upon reset.
- Sequential elements should have explicitly defined initial values to ensure predictable behavior.
  
Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the FSM handles transitions cleanly and there are no race conditions, particularly around the reset and pattern detection transitions.
- Consider edge cases where the reset is asserted and deasserted in quick succession; the module should still perform as specified.
