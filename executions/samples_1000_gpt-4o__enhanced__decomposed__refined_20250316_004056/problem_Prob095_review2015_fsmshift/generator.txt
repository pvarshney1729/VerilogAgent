<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule`, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal based on the clock and reset inputs. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles when a reset occurs and then keep it deasserted until the next reset.

1. **Inputs and Outputs**: We have a clock (`clk`), a synchronous reset (`reset`), and an output (`shift_ena`). All are single-bit signals.

2. **State Management**: We use a 3-bit counter (`cycle_count`) to keep track of the number of cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted. The counter is initialized to 4 on reset.

3. **Reset Logic**: On a synchronous reset, the `cycle_count` is set to 4, and `shift_ena` is asserted. This ensures that `shift_ena` is high for the first 4 cycles after a reset.

4. **Counting Logic**: If the `cycle_count` is not zero, it is decremented on each clock cycle, and `shift_ena` remains high. Once the counter reaches zero, `shift_ena` is deasserted.

5. **Synchronous Operation**: The entire logic is synchronous with respect to the clock, and the reset is sampled on the clock's positive edge.

This approach ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 cycles after a reset and remains deasserted until the next reset, as specified.
