Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal used for synchronous operations.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
  - in: 1-bit input signal that drives state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output signal representing the state output.

Design Specifications:
1. State Machine Type: Moore State Machine with two states:
   - State B: Output `out` is 1.
   - State A: Output `out` is 0.

2. State Encoding:
   - State B encoded as 1'b0
   - State A encoded as 1'b1

3. State Transition Logic:
   - From State B:
     - Transition to State A when `in` = 0.
     - Remain in State B when `in` = 1.
   - From State A:
     - Transition to State B when `in` = 0.
     - Remain in State A when `in` = 1.

4. Reset Behavior:
   - The reset signal is active-high and synchronous, meaning it will only be evaluated on the rising edge of the clock.
   - Upon activation of the reset, the state machine transitions to State B, irrespective of the current state or input.

5. Signal Conventions:
   - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

6. Initial Conditions:
   - On power-up, the initial state is not defined by this specification; ensure reset is asserted to initialize the state machine.

7. State Transition Table:
   - Current State: B, Input: 0, Next State: A, Output: 1
   - Current State: B, Input: 1, Next State: B, Output: 1
   - Current State: A, Input: 0, Next State: B, Output: 0
   - Current State: A, Input: 1, Next State: A, Output: 0

Note: The design assumes the presence of a stable clock signal to ensure reliable state transitions.
