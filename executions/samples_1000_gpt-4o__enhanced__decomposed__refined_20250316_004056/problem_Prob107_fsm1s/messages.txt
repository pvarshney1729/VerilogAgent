State Machine Type: Moore State Machine with two states:\n   - State B: Output `out` is 1.\n   - State A: Output `out` is 0.\n\n2. State Encoding:\n   - State B encoded as 1'b0\n   - State A encoded as 1'b1\n\n3. State Transition Logic:\n   - From State B:\n     - Transition to State A when `in` = 0.\n     - Remain in State B when `in` = 1.\n   - From State A:\n     - Transition to State B when `in` = 0.\n     - Remain in State A when `in` = 1.\n\n4. Reset Behavior:\n   - The reset signal is active-high and synchronous, meaning it will only be evaluated on the rising edge of the clock.\n   - Upon activation of the reset, the state machine transitions to State B, irrespective of the current state or input.\n\n5. Signal Conventions:\n   - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n6. Initial Conditions:\n   - On power-up, the initial state is not defined by this specification; ensure reset is asserted to initialize the state machine.\n\n7. State Transition Table:\n   - Current State: B, Input: 0, Next State: A, Output: 1\n   - Current State: B, Input: 1, Next State: B, Output: 1\n   - Current State: A, Input: 0, Next State: B, Output: 0\n   - Current State: A, Input: 1, Next State: A, Output: 0\n\nNote: The design assumes the presence of a stable clock signal to ensure reliable state transitions.\n                    "

All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nImplement the following Moore state machine with two states, one input,\nand one output. The reset state is B and reset is active-high\nsynchronous.\n\n  B (out=1) --in=0--> A\n  B (out=1) --in=1--> B\n  A (out=0) --in=0--> B\n  A (out=0) --in=1--> A\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "
