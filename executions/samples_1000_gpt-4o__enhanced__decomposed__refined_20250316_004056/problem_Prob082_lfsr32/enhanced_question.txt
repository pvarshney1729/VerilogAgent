Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal; all sequential operations are triggered on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset; when asserted, the register output `q` is reset to 32'h1.

- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 32-bit output representing the current state of the Galois LFSR.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
2. The shifting operation is performed to the right.
3. Tap positions are defined at bit indices 31, 21, 1, and 0 (considering `q[31]` as the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and `q[0]` as the Least Significant Bit (LSB)).
4. The feedback mechanism:
   - The next state of `q[31]` is determined by XORing the current `q[0]` with bits at tap positions `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.
   - Bits without taps, specifically `q[30:1]`, shift to the right unaltered.
5. The reset condition:
   - When `reset` is asserted high, the entire register `q` is reset synchronously to the initial value of 32'h1 on the next positive clock edge.
6. Initialization:
   - On module instantiation or on reset, `q` is explicitly initialized to 32'h1.
7. Edge and boundary cases:
   - Ensure that the LFSR does not enter a lockup state by proper initialization on reset.
   - Handle all transitions ensuring correct bit shifting and feedback operations.

Note: Bit indexing follows zero-based numbering, with `q[0]` as the LSB and `q[31]` as the MSB.
