Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal; all sequential operations are triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset; when asserted, the register output `q` is reset to 32'h1.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `q`: 32-bit output representing the current state of the Galois LFSR.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n2. The shifting operation is performed to the right.\n3. Tap positions are defined at bit indices 31, 21, 1, and 0 (considering `q[31]` as the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and `q[0]` as the Least Significant Bit (LSB)).\n4. The feedback mechanism:\n   - The next state of `q[31]` is determined by XORing the current `q[0]` with bits at tap positions `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.\n   - Bits without taps, specifically `q[30:1]`, shift to the right unaltered.\n5. The reset condition:\n   - When `reset` is asserted high, the entire register `q` is reset synchronously to the initial value of 32'h1 on the next positive clock edge.\n6. Initialization:\n   - On module instantiation or on reset, `q` is explicitly initialized to 32'h1.\n7. Edge and boundary cases:\n   - Ensure that the LFSR does not enter a lockup state by proper initialization on reset.\n   - Handle all transitions ensuring correct bit shifting and feedback operations.\n\nNote: Bit indexing follows zero-based numbering, with `q[0]` as the LSB and `q[31]` as the MSB.\n                    "
