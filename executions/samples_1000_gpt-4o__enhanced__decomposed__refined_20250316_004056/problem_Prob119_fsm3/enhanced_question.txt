Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal; triggers sequential logic on the positive edge.
  - areset: 1-bit asynchronous reset signal; active high, resets state machine to initial state on the positive edge.
  - in: 1-bit input signal for state transition.

- Outputs:
  - out: 1-bit output signal.

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore state machine.
- Number of States: Four (A, B, C, D).

State Encoding:
- State A: 2'b00
- State B: 2'b01
- State C: 2'b10
- State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table:
| Current State | next state (in=0) | next state (in=1) | Output |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |
| B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |
| C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |
| D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |

Operational Details:
- Upon an active high asynchronous reset (areset = 1), the state machine resets to State A, irrespective of the clock signal.
- Transition between states occurs on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The output is determined solely by the current state and does not depend on the input.

Reset State:
- All state registers are reset to 2'b00 (State A) upon activation of the asynchronous reset.

Bit Indexing:
- For multi-bit signals, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that all inputs are properly synchronized with the clk signal to prevent metastability issues.
- The state transitions should be robust against any glitches on the input signal by ensuring proper debouncing if necessary.

Initial Values:
- On power-up or reset, the system initializes to State A with the output set to 0.
