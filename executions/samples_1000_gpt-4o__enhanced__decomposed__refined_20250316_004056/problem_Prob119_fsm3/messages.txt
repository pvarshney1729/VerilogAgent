The module is designed to implement a Moore state machine with four states (A, B, C, D) and a single input and output. The state transitions and output logic are based on the given state transition table.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit enumeration (`state_t`) for clarity and ease of understanding. Each state is assigned a unique 2-bit value.\n\n2. **State Register with Asynchronous Reset**: The state register is implemented using an `always_ff` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset (`areset`). When `areset` is high, the state machine resets to `STATE_A`.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented using an `always_comb` block. The next state is determined based on the current state and the input `in`, following the provided state transition table.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output logic is also implemented using an `always_comb` block. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine model.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and `always_comb` for combinational logic.
