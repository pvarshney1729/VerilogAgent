Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\nInterface:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal, used to synchronize all sequential elements, triggered on the positive edge.\n- `input reset`: Active high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the state machine resets to its initial state.\n- `input data`: Serial data input, 1-bit width, used for pattern detection and duration specification.\n- `input done_counting`: 1-bit input signal indicating when external counters have finished counting.\n- `input ack`: 1-bit input signal indicating user acknowledgment of timer completion.\n- `output shift_ena`: 1-bit output signal, enables shifting of additional bits for duration determination.\n- `output counting`: 1-bit output signal, indicates the state machine is in the counting phase.\n- `output done`: 1-bit output signal, indicates the timer has completed and is awaiting user acknowledgment.\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. **Pattern Detection**: The state machine continuously monitors the `data` input for the specific 4-bit pattern `1101`. This is done bit sequentially, starting from the most significant bit (MSB).\n2. **Timer Initialization**: Upon detecting the `1101` pattern, the state machine asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles to enable shifting in 4 additional bits from the `data` input to determine the delay duration.\n3. **Counting Phase**: After the duration bits are latched, the state machine asserts the `counting` output, indicating it is waiting for the counting operation to complete, as signaled by `done_counting` being high.\n4. **Completion Notification**: Once `done_counting` is high, the state machine asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has expired.\n5. **Acknowledgment Wait**: The state machine remains in the `done` state until the `ack` signal is asserted, upon which it resets and returns to monitoring for the next `1101` pattern occurrence.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On the assertion of the `reset` signal, the state machine is synchronously reset to the initial pattern detection state, ready to search for the `1101` pattern.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions and sequential logic operations are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up or reset, the state machine is in its initial state, waiting to detect the `1101` pattern.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Correct handling of consecutive `1101` patterns and partial patterns should be ensured without false triggering.\n- Ensure that `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are correctly deasserted when not in their respective states.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to design a finite state machine (FSM) that meets the given specifications. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the different states of the FSM. The states include `IDLE`, `DETECT_1`, `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`, `DETECT_1101`, `SHIFT`, `COUNT`, and `DONE`. Each state is assigned a unique 3-bit binary code.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input signals and the current state. The transitions are defined in an `always_ff` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The `reset` signal is used to synchronously reset the FSM to the `IDLE` state.\n\n3. **Shift Counter**: A 3-bit counter `shift_counter` is used to count the number of clock cycles during which `shift_ena` is asserted. This counter is incremented in the `SHIFT` state and reset in other states.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented in an `always @(*)` block. This block evaluates the current state and input signals to determine the next state and the values of the output signals (`shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done`).\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The outputs are controlled based on the current state:\n   - `shift_ena` is asserted in the `SHIFT` state for exactly 4 clock cycles.\n   - `counting` is asserted in the `COUNT` state, indicating that the FSM is waiting for the counting operation to complete.\n   - `done` is asserted in the `DONE` state, indicating that the timer has expired and is awaiting user acknowledgment.\n\n6. **State Transitions**:\n   - The FSM starts in the `IDLE` state and transitions to `DETECT_1` upon detecting the first '1' of the pattern `1101`.\n   - It continues to transition through `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`, and `DETECT_1101` as it detects the complete pattern.\n   - Upon detecting `1101`, it enters the `SHIFT` state, where it enables `shift_ena` for 4 cycles.\n   - After shifting, it transitions to the `COUNT` state, waiting for `done_counting`.\n   - Once `done_counting` is asserted, it transitions to the `DONE` state, waiting for `ack` to return to `IDLE`.\n\nThis design ensures that the FSM correctly implements the specified behavior, including pattern detection, shifting, counting, and acknowledgment handling.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    output logic shift_ena,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE        = 3'b000,\n        DETECT_1    = 3'b001,\n        DETECT_11   = 3'b010,\n        DETECT_110  = 3'b011,\n        DETECT_1101 = 3'b100,\n        SHIFT       = 3'b101,\n        COUNT       = 3'b110,\n        DONE        = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] shift_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == SHIFT)\n                shift_counter <= shift_counter + 1;\n            else\n                shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1;\n            end\n            DETECT_1: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_11;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_11: begin\n                if (~data) next_state = DETECT_110;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_110: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1101;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_1101: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                next_state = SHIFT;\n            end\n            SHIFT: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                if (shift_counter == 3'b011) next_state = COUNT;\n            end\n            COUNT: begin\n                counting = 1'b1;\n                if (done_counting) next_state = DONE;\n            end\n            DONE: begin\n                done = 1'b1;\n                if (ack) next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  data\n - input  done_counting\n - input  ack\n - output shift_ena\n - output counting\n - output done\n\nThe module should implement a timer that:\n\n  (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,\n  (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n  (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n  (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n\nIn this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls\nthe timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included\nhere.\n\nThe serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101\nis received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for\nexactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its\ncounting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits\nuntil input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must\nassert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until\ninput ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the\nstart sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high\nsynchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the\ninput sequence 1101. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the\npositive edge of the clock.\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to create a finite state machine (FSM) that meets the specified requirements. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses a set of states encoded as a 3-bit value. The states are:\n   - `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the pattern `1101`.\n   - `DETECT_1`, `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`, `DETECT_1101`: Intermediate states for detecting the pattern `1101`.\n   - `SHIFT`: State where the FSM enables shifting of 4 bits to determine the delay duration.\n   - `COUNT`: State indicating the FSM is waiting for the counting process to complete.\n   - `DONE`: State indicating the timer has completed and is waiting for user acknowledgment.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input `data` and other control signals (`done_counting`, `ack`):\n   - From `IDLE`, it moves to `DETECT_1` when `data` is high.\n   - It continues through the detection states as the pattern `1101` is recognized.\n   - Upon detecting `1101`, it transitions to `SHIFT`, where `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 cycles.\n   - After shifting, it moves to `COUNT`, asserting `counting` until `done_counting` is high.\n   - Finally, it transitions to `DONE`, asserting `done` until `ack` is received, then returns to `IDLE`.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are controlled based on the current state:\n   - `shift_ena` is asserted in the `SHIFT` state.\n   - `counting` is asserted in the `COUNT` state.\n   - `done` is asserted in the `DONE` state.\n\n4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize the state to `IDLE` and reset the shift counter.\n\n5. **Shift Counter**: A 3-bit counter is used to track the 4 cycles during which `shift_ena` is asserted.\n\nThis design ensures that the FSM correctly detects the pattern, manages the timing sequence, and handles user acknowledgment as specified.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    output logic shift_ena,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE        = 3'b000,\n        DETECT_1    = 3'b001,\n        DETECT_11   = 3'b010,\n        DETECT_110  = 3'b011,\n        DETECT_1101 = 3'b100,\n        SHIFT       = 3'b101,\n        COUNT       = 3'b110,\n        DONE        = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] shift_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == SHIFT)\n                shift_counter <= shift_counter + 1;\n            else\n                shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1;\n            end\n            DETECT_1: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_11;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_11: begin\n                if (~data) next_state = DETECT_110;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_110: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1101;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_1101: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                next_state = SHIFT;\n            end\n            SHIFT: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                if (shift_counter == 3'b011) next_state = COUNT;\n            end\n            COUNT: begin\n                counting = 1'b1;\n                if (done_counting) next_state = DONE;\n            end\n            DONE: begin\n                done = 1'b1;\n                if (ack) next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
