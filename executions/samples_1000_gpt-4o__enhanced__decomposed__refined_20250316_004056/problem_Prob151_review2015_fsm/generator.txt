The implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to create a finite state machine (FSM) that meets the specified requirements. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses a set of states encoded as a 3-bit value. The states are:
   - `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the pattern `1101`.
   - `DETECT_1`, `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`, `DETECT_1101`: Intermediate states for detecting the pattern `1101`.
   - `SHIFT`: State where the FSM enables shifting of 4 bits to determine the delay duration.
   - `COUNT`: State indicating the FSM is waiting for the counting process to complete.
   - `DONE`: State indicating the timer has completed and is waiting for user acknowledgment.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input `data` and other control signals (`done_counting`, `ack`):
   - From `IDLE`, it moves to `DETECT_1` when `data` is high.
   - It continues through the detection states as the pattern `1101` is recognized.
   - Upon detecting `1101`, it transitions to `SHIFT`, where `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 cycles.
   - After shifting, it moves to `COUNT`, asserting `counting` until `done_counting` is high.
   - Finally, it transitions to `DONE`, asserting `done` until `ack` is received, then returns to `IDLE`.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are controlled based on the current state:
   - `shift_ena` is asserted in the `SHIFT` state.
   - `counting` is asserted in the `COUNT` state.
   - `done` is asserted in the `DONE` state.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize the state to `IDLE` and reset the shift counter.

5. **Shift Counter**: A 3-bit counter is used to track the 4 cycles during which `shift_ena` is asserted.

This design ensures that the FSM correctly detects the pattern, manages the timing sequence, and handles user acknowledgment as specified.
