Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal (1 bit), positive edge-triggered.
  - `input in`: Serial data input (1 bit).
  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset (1 bit).

- Output Ports:
  - `output [7:0] out_byte`: 8-bit output for the received data byte.
  - `output done`: Indicates a correctly received byte (1 bit).

Specifications:
1. Data Transmission Protocol:
   - The serial protocol includes: 
     - 1 Start Bit: Logic 0
     - 8 Data Bits: Sent LSB (bit[0]) first
     - 1 Stop Bit: Logic 1
   - The line is idle at logic 1 when no data is transmitted.

2. Finite State Machine (FSM):
   - The FSM must identify the start bit, receive the subsequent 8 data bits, and verify the stop bit.
   - The FSM should assert `done` when a complete byte (start, 8 data bits, stop) is correctly received.
   - If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM will resume operation after detecting the next valid stop bit.

3. Operation Details:
   - `out_byte` is valid only when `done` is asserted (logic 1) and is considered a don't-care state otherwise.
   - The `done` signal is asserted each time a correct stop bit is detected following 8 data bits.
   - The module should handle misaligned input sequences by waiting for a valid start bit after a stop bit error.

4. Reset Behavior:
   - On assertion of the synchronous reset, all internal states and registers should return to their initial states.
   - The `reset` signal should synchronize with the `clk` to ensure predictable state transitions.

5. Timing and Edge Sensitivity:
   - All sequential logic within the module should be triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
   - The design must handle input transitions occurring at the clock edges effectively.

6. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
   - The FSM should handle consecutive start bits by restarting the reception process for a new byte.
   - Ensure that any data received during the reset period does not affect the FSM's behavior once the reset is deasserted.
