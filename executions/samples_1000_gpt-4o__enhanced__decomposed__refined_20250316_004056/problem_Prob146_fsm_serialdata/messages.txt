        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal (1 bit), positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input in`: Serial data input (1 bit).\n  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset (1 bit).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output [7:0] out_byte`: 8-bit output for the received data byte.\n  - `output done`: Indicates a correctly received byte (1 bit).\n\nSpecifications:\n1. Data Transmission Protocol:\n   - The serial protocol includes: \n     - 1 Start Bit: Logic 0\n     - 8 Data Bits: Sent LSB (bit[0]) first\n     - 1 Stop Bit: Logic 1\n   - The line is idle at logic 1 when no data is transmitted.\n\n2. Finite State Machine (FSM):\n   - The FSM must identify the start bit, receive the subsequent 8 data bits, and verify the stop bit.\n   - The FSM should assert `done` when a complete byte (start, 8 data bits, stop) is correctly received.\n   - If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM will resume operation after detecting the next valid stop bit.\n\n3. Operation Details:\n   - `out_byte` is valid only when `done` is asserted (logic 1) and is considered a don't-care state otherwise.\n   - The `done` signal is asserted each time a correct stop bit is detected following 8 data bits.\n   - The module should handle misaligned input sequences by waiting for a valid start bit after a stop bit error.\n\n4. Reset Behavior:\n   - On assertion of the synchronous reset, all internal states and registers should return to their initial states.\n   - The `reset` signal should synchronize with the `clk` to ensure predictable state transitions.\n\n5. Timing and Edge Sensitivity:\n   - All sequential logic within the module should be triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.\n   - The design must handle input transitions occurring at the clock edges effectively.\n\n6. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n   - The FSM should handle consecutive start bits by restarting the reception process for a new byte.\n   - Ensure that any data received during the reset period does not affect the FSM's behavior once the reset is deasserted.\n                    "
