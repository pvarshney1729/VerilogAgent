Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input wire resetn: Synchronous, active-low reset signal.
- input wire x: Motor input signal.
- input wire y: Motor input signal.
- output reg f: Motor control signal.
- output reg g: Motor control signal.

Design Specification:
1. The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to control a motor using inputs x and y.
2. The FSM is driven by the clk signal and is reset by a synchronous, active-low resetn signal.
3. The initial state of the FSM is State A. In this state:
   - The FSM remains in State A as long as resetn is deasserted (logic high).
   - When resetn is asserted (logic low) and on the next rising edge of clk, the FSM transitions out of State A.
4. Upon transitioning out of State A, the output f is set to logic high (1) for exactly one clock cycle.
5. Following the f logic high condition, the FSM monitors input x:
   - If input x follows the sequence of 1, 0, 1 across three successive clock cycles, the FSM sets output g to logic high (1) on the clock cycle immediately following the sequence.
6. Once g is set to logic high (1), the FSM monitors input y:
   - If input y becomes logic high (1) within the next two clock cycles, the FSM maintains g at logic high (1) indefinitely until the next reset.
   - If input y does not become logic high (1) within two clock cycles, the FSM sets g to logic low (0) permanently until the next reset.
7. All FSM transitions are triggered by the positive edge of the clk signal.
8. It is assumed that all sequential elements are initialized to logic low (0) upon reset.

Bit Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that transitions between states do not occur inadvertently due to signal glitches or race conditions.
- The FSM should handle boundary conditions where x or y signals change state precisely at the clock edge.

Initial Values:
- Registers and outputs are initialized to logic low (0) upon the assertion of the resetn signal (active low).

State Descriptions:
- State A: Initial state, awaiting reset deassertion.
- State B: Transition state post-reset where f is asserted.
- State C: Monitoring x for sequence detection.
- State D: Maintaining g high and monitoring y for confirmation.
- State E: Permanent states for g based on y observation.

Note: All unspecified behavior is assumed to maintain the last known state until the next specified condition is met.
