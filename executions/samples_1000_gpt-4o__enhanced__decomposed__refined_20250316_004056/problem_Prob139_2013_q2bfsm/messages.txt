        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- input wire resetn: Synchronous, active-low reset signal.\n- input wire x: Motor input signal.\n- input wire y: Motor input signal.\n- output reg f: Motor control signal.\n- output reg g: Motor control signal.\n\nDesign Specification:\n1. The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to control a motor using inputs x and y.\n2. The FSM is driven by the clk signal and is reset by a synchronous, active-low resetn signal.\n3. The initial state of the FSM is State A. In this state:\n   - The FSM remains in State A as long as resetn is deasserted (logic high).\n   - When resetn is asserted (logic low) and on the next rising edge of clk, the FSM transitions out of State A.\n4. Upon transitioning out of State A, the output f is set to logic high (1) for exactly one clock cycle.\n5. Following the f logic high condition, the FSM monitors input x:\n   - If input x follows the sequence of 1, 0, 1 across three successive clock cycles, the FSM sets output g to logic high (1) on the clock cycle immediately following the sequence.\n6. Once g is set to logic high (1), the FSM monitors input y:\n   - If input y becomes logic high (1) within the next two clock cycles, the FSM maintains g at logic high (1) indefinitely until the next reset.\n   - If input y does not become logic high (1) within two clock cycles, the FSM sets g to logic low (0) permanently until the next reset.\n7. All FSM transitions are triggered by the positive edge of the clk signal.\n8. It is assumed that all sequential elements are initialized to logic low (0) upon reset.\n\nBit Conventions:\n- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that transitions between states do not occur inadvertently due to signal glitches or race conditions.\n- The FSM should handle boundary conditions where x or y signals change state precisely at the clock edge.\n\nInitial Values:\n- Registers and outputs are initialized to logic low (0) upon the assertion of the resetn signal (active low).\n\nState Descriptions:\n- State A: Initial state, awaiting reset deassertion.\n- State B: Transition state post-reset where f is asserted.\n- State C: Monitoring x for sequence detection.\n- State D: Maintaining g high and monitoring y for confirmation.\n- State E: Permanent states for g based on y observation.\n\nNote: All unspecified behavior is assumed to maintain the last known state until the next specified condition is met.\n                    "

The FSM is designed with the following states:\n\n1. **STATE_A**: The initial state where the FSM waits for the reset signal to be deasserted. When reset is deasserted, the FSM transitions to STATE_B and sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.\n\n2. **STATE_B**: This state is used to ensure `f` is set to 1 for exactly one clock cycle. The FSM then transitions to STATE_C.\n\n3. **STATE_C**: In this state, the FSM monitors the input `x` for the sequence 1, 0, 1. A shift register `x_sequence` is used to track the last two values of `x`. If the sequence is detected, the FSM transitions to STATE_D and sets `g` to 1.\n\n4. **STATE_D**: This state confirms the detection of the sequence and sets `g` to 1. The FSM then transitions to STATE_E.\n\n5. **STATE_E**: In this state, the FSM monitors the input `y` for up to two clock cycles. If `y` becomes 1, `g` remains 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1 within two cycles, `g` is set to 0. A counter `y_counter` is used to track the number of cycles.\n\nThe FSM uses synchronous reset logic, and all state transitions are triggered by the positive edge of the clock.

If the sequence is detected, the FSM transitions to `STATE_D`, and `g` is set to 1.\n\n4. **State D**: In this state, `g` is maintained at 1, and the FSM transitions to `STATE_E`.\n\n5. **State E**: The FSM monitors the input `y` for up to two clock cycles. If `y` becomes 1, `g` remains 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1 within two cycles, `g` is set to 0, and the FSM transitions back to `STATE_A`.\n\nThe FSM uses a counter (`y_counter`) to track the number of clock cycles in `STATE_E` without `y` being 1.\n\nThe implementation follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided, using `logic` for all signals, and ensuring synchronous reset behavior.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic x,\n    input logic y,\n    output logic f,\n    output logic g\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] x_sequence;\n    logic [1:0] y_counter;\n\n    // State transition and output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            f <= 0;\n            g <= 0;\n            x_sequence <= 2'b00;\n            y_counter <= 0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            case (current_state)\n                STATE_A: begin\n                    f <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_B: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_C: begin\n                    if (x_sequence == 2'b10 && x == 1) begin\n                        g <= 1;\n                    end\n                end\n                STATE_D: begin\n                    g <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_E: begin\n                    if (y) begin\n                        g <= 1;\n                    end else if (y_counter == 2) begin\n                        g <= 0;\n                    end\n                end\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (!resetn) begin\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                end\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                next_state = STATE_C;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                x_sequence = {x_sequence[0], x};\n                if (x_sequence == 2'b10 && x == 1) begin\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n                end\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                next_state = STATE_E;\n            end\n            STATE_E: begin\n                if (y) begin\n                    next_state = STATE_E;\n                end else if (y_counter == 2) begin\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n                end\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Y counter logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            y_counter <= 0;\n        end else if (current_state == STATE_E) begin\n            if (!y) begin\n                y_counter <= y_counter + 1;\n            end else begin\n                y_counter <= 0;\n            end\n        end else begin\n            y_counter <= 0;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
