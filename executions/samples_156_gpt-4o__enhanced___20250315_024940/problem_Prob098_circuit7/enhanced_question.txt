<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - a: 1-bit input (data signal)

- Output Ports:
  - q: 1-bit output (data signal)

Clocking and Behavior:
- This module implements sequential logic triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).
- The output (q) is updated on the rising edge of clk based on the value of input (a).

Reset Behavior:
- The module does not include an explicit reset signal. The initial state of q is undefined until the first positive edge of clk.

Signal Timing Specification:
- The behavior of the output (q) is inferred from the provided simulation waveforms as follows:

  | Time (ns) | clk | a | q |
  |------------|-----|---|---|
  | 0          | 0   | x | x |
  | 5          | 1   | 0 | x |
  | 10         | 0   | 0 | x |
  | 15         | 1   | 0 | 1 |
  | 20         | 0   | 0 | 1 |
  | 25         | 1   | 0 | 1 |
  | 30         | 0   | 0 | 1 |
  | 35         | 1   | 1 | 1 |
  | 40         | 0   | 1 | 1 |
  | 45         | 1   | 1 | 0 |
  | 50         | 0   | 1 | 0 |
  | 55         | 1   | 1 | 0 |
  | 60         | 0   | 1 | 0 |
  | 65         | 1   | 1 | 0 |
  | 70         | 0   | 1 | 0 |
  | 75         | 1   | 1 | 0 |
  | 80         | 0   | 1 | 0 |
  | 85         | 1   | 1 | 0 |
  | 90         | 0   | 1 | 0 |

- The initial condition of the output (q) at time 0ns is unknown (x) until the first valid clock edge.
- The output (q) transitions according to the following inferred logic:
  - At the rising edge of clk (5ns, 15ns, 25ns, etc.), the output q samples the value of a.
  - The output q remains stable during low periods of the clk.
  - The transitions of q occur based on the input a's value at the time of the rising edge of clk.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- The output q should not be driven by the input a until the first rising edge of clk, where it can take the known value from a.
- If the input a remains constant during multiple clock cycles, q should maintain its value until the next rising edge of clk where a may change.

Signal Dependencies and Precedence:
- The output q is solely dependent on the value of input a at the time of the rising edge of clk. No other conditions affect the output.
- Ensure that no race conditions occur between the clock signal and the input signal's changes.

Initial Conditions:
- All sequential elements, specifically the output q, do not have an explicitly defined initial value and should be considered undefined until the first positive edge of clk.

Formal Description:
- Let clk(t) be the clock signal at time t, a(t) be the input signal at time t, and q(t) be the output signal at time t.
- The output q(t) is defined as:
  - q(t) = a(t) when clk(t) transitions from 0 to 1 (positive edge).
  - q(t) remains constant during the low period of clk until the next positive edge.

This specification provides detailed definitions and clarifications on the input/output ports, signal behavior, and dependencies to ensure correct implementation of the TopModule.
