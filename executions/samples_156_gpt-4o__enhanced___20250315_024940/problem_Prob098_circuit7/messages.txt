Read the simulation waveforms to determine\nwhat the circuit does, then implement it.\n\n  time  clk a   q\n  0ns   0   x   x\n  5ns   1   0   x\n  10ns  0   0   x\n  15ns  1   0   1\n  20ns  0   0   1\n  25ns  1   0   1\n  30ns  0   0   1\n  35ns  1   1   1\n  40ns  0   1   1\n  45ns  1   1   0\n  50ns  0   1   0\n  55ns  1   1   0\n  60ns  0   1   0\n  65ns  1   1   0\n  70ns  0   1   0\n  75ns  1   1   0\n  80ns  0   1   0\n  85ns  1   1   0\n  90ns  0   1   0\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)\n  - a: 1-bit input (data signal)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 1-bit output (data signal)\n\nClocking and Behavior:\n- This module implements sequential logic triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).\n- The output (q) is updated on the rising edge of clk based on the value of input (a).\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module does not include an explicit reset signal. The initial state of q is undefined until the first positive edge of clk.\n\nSignal Timing Specification:\n- The behavior of the output (q) is inferred from the provided simulation waveforms as follows:\n\n  | Time (ns) | clk | a | q |\n  |------------|-----|---|---|\n  | 0          | 0   | x | x |\n  | 5          | 1   | 0 | x |\n  | 10         | 0   | 0 | x |\n  | 15         | 1   | 0 | 1 |\n  | 20         | 0   | 0 | 1 |\n  | 25         | 1   | 0 | 1 |\n  | 30         | 0   | 0 | 1 |\n  | 35         | 1   | 1 | 1 |\n  | 40         | 0   | 1 | 1 |\n  | 45         | 1   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 50         | 0   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 55         | 1   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 60         | 0   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 65         | 1   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 70         | 0   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 75         | 1   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 80         | 0   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 85         | 1   | 1 | 0 |\n  | 90         | 0   | 1 | 0 |\n\n- The initial condition of the output (q) at time 0ns is unknown (x) until the first valid clock edge.\n- The output (q) transitions according to the following inferred logic:\n  - At the rising edge of clk (5ns, 15ns, 25ns, etc.), the output q samples the value of a.\n  - The output q remains stable during low periods of the clk.\n  - The transitions of q occur based on the input a's value at the time of the rising edge of clk.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- The output q should not be driven by the input a until the first rising edge of clk, where it can take the known value from a.\n- If the input a remains constant during multiple clock cycles, q should maintain its value until the next rising edge of clk where a may change.\n\nSignal Dependencies and Precedence:\n- The output q is solely dependent on the value of input a at the time of the rising edge of clk. No other conditions affect the output.\n- Ensure that no race conditions occur between the clock signal and the input signal's changes.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All sequential elements, specifically the output q, do not have an explicitly defined initial value and should be considered undefined until the first positive edge of clk.\n\nFormal Description:\n- Let clk(t) be the clock signal at time t, a(t) be the input signal at time t, and q(t) be the output signal at time t.\n- The output q(t) is defined as:\n  - q(t) = a(t) when clk(t) transitions from 0 to 1 (positive edge).\n  - q(t) remains constant during the low period of clk until the next positive edge.\n\nThis specification provides detailed definitions and clarifications on the input/output ports, signal behavior, and dependencies to ensure correct implementation of the TopModule.\n                    "
