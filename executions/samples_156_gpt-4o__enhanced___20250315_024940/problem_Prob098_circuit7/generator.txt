Based on the provided specifications and the behavior inferred from the simulation waveforms, here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule`. The implementation captures the sequential logic behavior described.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic a,
    output logic q
);

    // Initialize q to 0 at the beginning
    initial begin
        q = 1'b0;  // Set initial value of q
    end

    // Sequential logic that updates q on the positive edge of clk
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Update q based on the value of a at the rising edge of clk
        if (clk) begin
            q <= a ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; // Logic inferred from the waveform
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration**: The `TopModule` is defined with the specified input and output ports.
2. **Initial Block**: An `initial` block is included to set the initial value of `q` to `0`. This is necessary to ensure that `q` has a defined state before any clock signals are applied.
3. **Always Block**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to implement the sequential logic. It triggers on the rising edge of the clock signal.
4. **Output Logic**: The output `q` is updated based on the value of `a` at the rising edge of the clock. The logic infers that:
   - If `a` is `1`, `q` is set to `0`.
   - If `a` is `0`, `q` is set to `1`.

This implementation adheres to the specified interface and behavior while following the provided guidelines and coding conventions.
