Based on the specifications and guidelines provided, here's the implementation of the `TopModule`. This module sign-extends an 8-bit input to a 32-bit output by replicating the sign bit as required.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic [7:0] in,   // 8-bit input
    output logic [31:0] out   // 32-bit output
);

    // Combinational logic to sign-extend the 8-bit input to 32 bits
    always @(*) begin
        out = { {24{in[7]}}, in }; // Replicate the sign bit 24 times and concatenate with the input
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule`, and it has a defined interface with one 8-bit input `in` and one 32-bit output `out`.

2. **Input and Output Declaration**: The input `in` is declared as an 8-bit logic vector, while the output `out` is declared as a 32-bit logic vector, adhering to the requirement for using `logic` type.

3. **Combinational Logic**: 
   - The `always @(*)` block is used to define combinational logic. This block automatically triggers whenever any of its input signals change.
   - Inside the block, the output `out` is calculated using concatenation:
     - The replication operator `{24{in[7]}}` creates a 24-bit vector where the MSB of `in` (the sign bit) is replicated 24 times.
     - This is concatenated with the original 8-bit input `in` to form the full 32-bit output.

4. **Sign Extension**: The method effectively sign-extends the 8-bit input to a 32-bit output by ensuring that the sign bit is correctly propagated.

This implementation follows all guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring clarity and correct functionality.
