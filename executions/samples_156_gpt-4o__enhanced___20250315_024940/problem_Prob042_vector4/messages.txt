All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in  (8  bits)\n - output out (32 bits)\n\nOne common place to see a replication operator is when sign-extending a\nsmaller number to a larger one, while preserving its signed value. This\nis done by replicating the sign bit (the most significant bit) of the\nsmaller number to the left. For example, sign-extending 4'b0101 (5) to 8\nbits results in 8'b00000101 (5), while sign-extending 4'b1101 (-3) to 8\nbits results in 8'b11111101 (-3). Implement a module that sign-extends an\n8-bit number to 32 bits. This requires a concatenation of 24 copies of\nthe sign bit (i.e., replicate bit[7] 24 times) followed by the 8-bit\nnumber itself.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

The sign extension is accomplished by replicating the most significant bit (MSB) of the input (bit[7]) a total of 24 times to the left of the original 8-bit value.\n\n1. Sign Extension Rule:\n   - If in[7] (the sign bit) is 0, then out will be 32'b00000000000000000000000000[in].\n   - If in[7] (the sign bit) is 1, then out will be 32'b11111111111111111111111111[in].\n\nBit Indexing Convention:\n- The least significant bit (LSB) of the input 'in' is referred to as in[0].\n- The most significant bit (MSB) of the input 'in' is referred to as in[7].\n- The LSB of the output 'out' is referred to as out[0].\n- The MSB of the output 'out' is referred to as out[31].\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that the sign bit (in[7]) is correctly replicated 24 times to create the upper part of the output.\n- The operation should be purely combinational, with no sequential elements or registers involved.\n- No synchronous or asynchronous resets are applied in this module.\n- The output must be valid and stable as soon as the input is provided, with no additional clock cycle dependencies.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module must handle all valid 8-bit input values (0 to 255 for unsigned, -128 to 127 for signed).\n- Output must correctly reflect sign extension for all possible input values, ensuring no overflow or unexpected behavior occurs.\n                    "
