Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[7:0] (8 bits, unsigned) 
    - Description: This input represents an 8-bit unsigned binary number.

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit[31:0] (32 bits, signed)
    - Description: This output represents a 32-bit signed binary number resulting from the sign-extension of the input.

Functional Description:
The module will perform a sign-extension operation on the 8-bit input 'in' to produce a 32-bit output 'out'. The sign extension is accomplished by replicating the most significant bit (MSB) of the input (bit[7]) a total of 24 times to the left of the original 8-bit value.

1. Sign Extension Rule:
   - If in[7] (the sign bit) is 0, then out will be 32'b00000000000000000000000000[in].
   - If in[7] (the sign bit) is 1, then out will be 32'b11111111111111111111111111[in].

Bit Indexing Convention:
- The least significant bit (LSB) of the input 'in' is referred to as in[0].
- The most significant bit (MSB) of the input 'in' is referred to as in[7].
- The LSB of the output 'out' is referred to as out[0].
- The MSB of the output 'out' is referred to as out[31].

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the sign bit (in[7]) is correctly replicated 24 times to create the upper part of the output.
- The operation should be purely combinational, with no sequential elements or registers involved.
- No synchronous or asynchronous resets are applied in this module.
- The output must be valid and stable as soon as the input is provided, with no additional clock cycle dependencies.

Edge Cases:
- The module must handle all valid 8-bit input values (0 to 255 for unsigned, -128 to 127 for signed).
- Output must correctly reflect sign extension for all possible input values, ensuring no overflow or unexpected behavior occurs.
