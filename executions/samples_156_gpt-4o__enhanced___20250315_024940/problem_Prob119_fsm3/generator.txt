Here is the Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` based on your specifications and guidelines:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic areset,
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        A = 2'b00,
        B = 2'b01,
        C = 2'b10,
        D = 2'b11
    } state_t;

    // State registers
    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Output logic based on the current state
    assign out = (current_state == D) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            A: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ? A : B;
            B: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ? C : B;
            C: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ? A : D;
            D: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ? C : B;
            default: next_state = A; // Default case for safety
        endcase
    end

    // Sequential logic for state update
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= A; // Reset state to A
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state; // Update state
        end
    end

    // Initialize current state to A on reset
    initial begin
        current_state = A;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with the specified input and output ports, all declared as `logic`.

2. **State Encoding**: The states are defined using an enumerated type `state_t` for clarity and readability.

3. **State Registers**: Two state variables, `current_state` and `next_state`, are declared to hold the current and next states of the FSM.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is assigned based on the current state. It is `1` only when in state `D`, otherwise it is `0`.

5. **Next State Logic**: An always block (with combinational logic) determines the `next_state` based on the `current_state` and the input `in`. The state transitions are implemented as per the state transition table.

6. **Sequential Logic**: Another always block (sensitive to the positive edge of `clk`) updates the `current_state`. If `areset` is high, it resets the state to `A`. Otherwise, it updates to the `next_state`.

7. **Initial State**: An initial block ensures that `current_state` is set to `A` at the start of simulation.

This implementation strictly follows the guidelines and conventions you provided, ensuring correct functionality for the described Moore state machine.
