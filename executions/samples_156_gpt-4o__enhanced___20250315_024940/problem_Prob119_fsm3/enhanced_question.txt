Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal)
  - in: 1-bit input (data signal)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (state machine output)

State Machine Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
- Number of States: 4
- State Encoding:
  - State A: 00
  - State B: 01
  - State C: 10
  - State D: 11

State Transition Table:
- The state machine transitions are defined as follows, based on the value of the input signal 'in':
  
| Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| A             | A                  | B                  | 0      |
| B             | C                  | B                  | 0      |
| C             | A                  | D                  | 0      |
| D             | C                  | B                  | 1      |

Reset Conditions:
- The asynchronous reset signal 'areset' will reset the state machine to State A (00) when asserted (active high).
- On the next positive edge of the clock, if 'areset' is high, the state will be set to State A regardless of the current state.

Sequential Logic Behavior:
- All state transitions and output logic shall occur on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).
- The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state of the state machine and is updated on the clock edge.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, all state registers should initialize to State A (00).
- The output 'out' should be set to 0 during the reset condition.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure proper handling of the 'areset' signal during clock cycles.
- Define behavior when 'in' remains constant (0 or 1) for multiple clock cycles.

Potential Race Conditions:
- Ensure that the transition logic and output logic do not create any race conditions during state transitions, especially during the reset condition.

Signal Dependencies:
- The next state logic is dependent on the current state and the input signal 'in'.
