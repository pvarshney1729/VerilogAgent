All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  mode\n - input  too_cold\n - input  too_hot\n - input  fan_on\n - output heater\n - output aircon\n - output fan\n\nThe module should implement a heating/cooling thermostat controller which\ncontrols both a heater (during winter) and an air conditioner (during\nsummer). The module should on and off the heater, air conditioning, and\nblower fan as appropriate. The thermostat can be in one of two modes:\nheating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the\nheater on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1) but do not use the air\nconditioner. In cooling mode, turn the air conditioner on when it is too\nhot (too_hot = 1), but do not turn on the heater. When the heater or air\nconditioner are on, also turn on the fan to circulate the air. In\naddition, the user can also request the fan to turn on (fan_on = 1), even\nif the heater and air conditioner are off.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - mode: bit (1 bit, where bit[0] is the least significant bit; mode = 1 indicates heating mode, mode = 0 indicates cooling mode)\n  - too_cold: bit (1 bit, indicates if the temperature is too cold; too_cold = 1 when the temperature is below the set threshold)\n  - too_hot: bit (1 bit, indicates if the temperature is too hot; too_hot = 1 when the temperature is above the set threshold)\n  - fan_on: bit (1 bit, user control for the fan; fan_on = 1 to request the fan to be turned on)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - heater: bit (1 bit, indicates the state of the heater; heater = 1 when the heater is turned on)\n  - aircon: bit (1 bit, indicates the state of the air conditioner; aircon = 1 when the air conditioner is turned on)\n  - fan: bit (1 bit, indicates the state of the fan; fan = 1 when the fan is turned on)\n\nFunctional Specification:\nThe module implements a heating/cooling thermostat controller with the following behavior:\n\n1. Modes:\n   - The module operates in one of two modes based on the value of the `mode` input:\n     - Heating Mode (mode = 1):\n       - If `too_cold` = 1, then set `heater` = 1 and `aircon` = 0.\n       - If `too_cold` = 0, then set `heater` = 0 and `aircon` = 0.\n     - Cooling Mode (mode = 0):\n       - If `too_hot` = 1, then set `aircon` = 1 and `heater` = 0.\n       - If `too_hot` = 0, then set `aircon` = 0 and `heater` = 0.\n\n2. Fan Control:\n   - The `fan` output should be set to 1 if either the `fan_on` input is 1 or if either the `heater` or `aircon` output is 1 (indicating that either heating or cooling is active). It should be set to 0 otherwise.\n\n3. Edge Cases:\n   - Ensure that when both `too_cold` and `too_hot` are 1, the module will prioritize the mode based on the `mode` input (heating mode will take precedence if mode = 1).\n   - The fan should never be off when either heating or cooling is active, regardless of the `fan_on` input.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module does not specify a reset; therefore, it is assumed that the initial state of all outputs is `heater` = 0, `aircon` = 0, and `fan` = 0 upon initialization.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The module's logic is combinational; the outputs depend solely on the current values of the inputs with no memory or state retention required.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The outputs `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan` depend on the values of inputs `mode`, `too_cold`, `too_hot`, and `fan_on` without any timing or delay constraints.\n                    "
