Based on the provided specifications and guidelines, here is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic mode,
    input  logic too_cold,
    input  logic too_hot,
    input  logic fan_on,
    output logic heater,
    output logic aircon,
    output logic fan
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Default output values
        heater = 1'b0;
        aircon = 1'b0;
        fan = 1'b0;

        // Control logic for heater and air conditioner based on mode
        if (mode) begin // Heating mode
            if (too_cold) begin
                heater = 1'b1; // Turn on heater
            end
            // Air conditioner is off in heating mode
        end else begin // Cooling mode
            if (too_hot) begin
                aircon = 1'b1; // Turn on air conditioner
            end
            // Heater is off in cooling mode
        end

        // Fan control: on if fan_on is 1 or if heater or aircon is on
        fan = fan_on || heater || aircon;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is declared with the specified input and output ports, all as `logic` type.

2. **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block is used to describe combinational logic, ensuring that the outputs are recalculated whenever any input changes.

3. **Default States**: The output values for `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan` are initialized to `0` at the beginning of the block.

4. **Heating and Cooling Logic**:
   - If `mode` is `1` (heating mode), and `too_cold` is `1`, the heater is turned on.
   - If `mode` is `0` (cooling mode), and `too_hot` is `1`, the air conditioner is turned on.
   - The corresponding component that is not in use (heater in cooling mode and air conditioner in heating mode) remains off.

5. **Fan Control**: The fan is controlled based on the user input `fan_on` or if either the heater or air conditioner is active.

This implementation adheres strictly to the guidelines and conventions provided, ensuring correct behavior as specified in the requirements.
