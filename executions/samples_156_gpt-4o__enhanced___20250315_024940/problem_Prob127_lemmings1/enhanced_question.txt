Module Name: TopModule

Interface Definition:
- Input Ports:
  - input clk: 1-bit clock signal (positive edge triggered)
  - input areset: 1-bit asynchronous reset signal (active high)
  - input bump_left: 1-bit signal indicating a bump from the left (active high)
  - input bump_right: 1-bit signal indicating a bump from the right (active high)

- Output Ports:
  - output reg walk_left: 1-bit output indicating Lemming is walking left (active high)
  - output reg walk_right: 1-bit output indicating Lemming is walking right (active high)

State Definitions:
- The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with the following states:
  - State 0: Walking Left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0)
  - State 1: Walking Right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1)

State Transition Logic:
- The Lemming transitions between states based on the following conditions:
  - If bump_left is asserted (1), transition to State 1 (walk_right = 1).
  - If bump_right is asserted (1), transition to State 0 (walk_left = 1).
  - If both bump_left and bump_right are asserted simultaneously, the Lemming will switch directions according to the last bump detected.

Reset Behavior:
- The areset signal resets the state machine to State 0 (walking left) on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- Upon reset, the output signals are defined as follows:
  - walk_left = 1
  - walk_right = 0

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and output assignments occur on the positive edge of the clk signal, ensuring synchronous behavior.
- The outputs walk_left and walk_right will only reflect the current state after the clk positive edge.

Edge Case Behavior:
- The FSM must be designed to handle simultaneous bumps (bump_left and bump_right both being high) consistently, prioritizing the last change detected before the clock edge.
- Ensure correct initialization of the FSM and outputs to avoid undefined behavior upon startup.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that the bump signals are checked immediately upon the positive edge of clk for state transitions, to avoid race conditions.

Initialization:
- All registers and outputs should have defined initial values upon reset.
