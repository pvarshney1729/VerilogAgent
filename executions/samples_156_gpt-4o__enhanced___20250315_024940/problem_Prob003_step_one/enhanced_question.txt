<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Ports:
  - output logic one; // 1-bit output, logic high

Functional Description:
- The module shall continuously drive the output port 'one' to a logic high level (1). 

Implementation Details:
- The output port 'one' is defined as a 1-bit wide, unsigned signal, where:
  - bit[0] represents the least significant bit (LSB).
- The module should be combinational in nature, with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.
- There are no reset conditions since the output is always driven high.
- There are no input ports defined for this module.

Edge Cases and Behavior:
- Under all conditions, the output 'one' must consistently output logic high (1).

Timing and Signal Integrity:
- There are no timing constraints or signal dependencies, as this is a straightforward combinational output.
