Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input signal (clock)
  - reset: 1-bit input signal (active high synchronous reset)

- Output Ports:
  - q: 10-bit output signal (counter value)
    - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB)
    - Bit[9] refers to the most significant bit (MSB)

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a synchronous counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive.
- The counter increments on the positive edge of the clock (clk).
- The counter has a period of 1000 clock cycles, meaning it will reset to 0 after reaching 999.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset input (reset) is active high and synchronous.
- When reset is high, the counter (q) is set to 10'b000000000 (0).
- The counter should maintain its value unless reset or incremented.

Initial Conditions:
- At power-up or upon a reset, the counter (q) should be initialized to 10'b000000000 (0).

Edge Case Handling:
- The counter will roll over to 0 after reaching 999 (10'b111110011).
- Ensure that the counter does not exceed the maximum count of 999 and wraps around to 0.
  
Dependencies:
- The counter's value (q) is solely dependent on the clk and reset signals.
- Ensure proper handling of clock edges to avoid race conditions between the clk and reset signals.

Timing Specifications:
- All operations occur in relation to the rising edge of clk.
