<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input [7:0] a;  // 8-bit unsigned input representing the first value
  - input [7:0] b;  // 8-bit unsigned input representing the second value
  - input [7:0] c;  // 8-bit unsigned input representing the third value
  - input [7:0] d;  // 8-bit unsigned input representing the fourth value

- Output Ports:
  - output [7:0] min;  // 8-bit unsigned output representing the minimum value among inputs a, b, c, and d

Functional Specification:
- The TopModule shall compute the minimum value among the four 8-bit unsigned input values (a, b, c, d) and provide this minimum value as an output on the min port.
- The comparison of values shall be performed using standard unsigned comparison operators (e.g., a < b).
- The output min shall reflect the minimum value of the inputs at the end of each combinational evaluation cycle.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The module shall handle edge cases where all input values are equal by outputting any of the input values as the minimum.
- The module shall also consider cases when the input values are at their maximum (255) or minimum (0) to ensure correct functionality.

Implementation Details:
- The module shall be implemented using combinational logic to ensure that the output min is updated continuously based on the current values of inputs a, b, c, and d without any clocking elements or delays.
