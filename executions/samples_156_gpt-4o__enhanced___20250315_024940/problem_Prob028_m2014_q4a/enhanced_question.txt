<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - d: bit[0] (1-bit wide; represents the data input)
  - ena: bit[0] (1-bit wide; represents the enable signal)

- Output Ports:
  - q: bit[0] (1-bit wide; represents the output of the D latch)

Functionality:
The TopModule shall implement a level-sensitive D latch. The behavior of the D latch is defined as follows:
- When ena (enable) is high (logic '1'), the output q shall follow the input d.
- When ena is low (logic '0'), the output q shall hold its previous state (i.e., remain unchanged).

Logic Description:
- The module will use an always block to implement the D latch's behavior.
- The latch is sensitive to changes in the ena signal.

Sequential Logic Characteristics:
- The D latch behavior is level-sensitive; thus, it does not depend on clock edges.
- The output q is updated immediately when ena transitions to high.

Reset Conditions:
- The design does not specify an asynchronous or synchronous reset. The default behavior will assume that there is no reset condition, and q will retain its last value when ena is low.

Initial Conditions:
- The initial value of output q must be defined. For simulation purposes, we will assume that q initializes to '0' at the start of the simulation.

Edge Cases:
- The module shall be tested for all possible combinations of d and ena to verify correct operation, particularly at the transitions of ena from low to high and high to low.

Dependencies:
- The output q depends on the current state of d and the enable signal ena.

Precedence of Operations:
- The enable signal ena takes precedence over the data input d when determining the output q.

Potential Race Conditions:
- There are no race conditions anticipated, as the design is intended to operate as a level-sensitive latch.

Please ensure that all implementation details adhere to the specified behaviors and conditions.
