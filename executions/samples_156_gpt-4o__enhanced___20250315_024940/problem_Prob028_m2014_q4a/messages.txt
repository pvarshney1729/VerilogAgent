All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  d\n - input  ena\n - output q\n\nThe module should impement a D latch using an always block.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - d: bit[0] (1-bit wide; represents the data input)\n  - ena: bit[0] (1-bit wide; represents the enable signal)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: bit[0] (1-bit wide; represents the output of the D latch)\n\nFunctionality:\nThe TopModule shall implement a level-sensitive D latch. The behavior of the D latch is defined as follows:\n- When ena (enable) is high (logic '1'), the output q shall follow the input d.\n- When ena is low (logic '0'), the output q shall hold its previous state (i.e., remain unchanged).\n\nLogic Description:\n- The module will use an always block to implement the D latch's behavior.\n- The latch is sensitive to changes in the ena signal.\n\nSequential Logic Characteristics:\n- The D latch behavior is level-sensitive; thus, it does not depend on clock edges.\n- The output q is updated immediately when ena transitions to high.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- The design does not specify an asynchronous or synchronous reset. The default behavior will assume that there is no reset condition, and q will retain its last value when ena is low.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The initial value of output q must be defined. For simulation purposes, we will assume that q initializes to '0' at the start of the simulation.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module shall be tested for all possible combinations of d and ena to verify correct operation, particularly at the transitions of ena from low to high and high to low.\n\nDependencies:\n- The output q depends on the current state of d and the enable signal ena.\n\nPrecedence of Operations:\n- The enable signal ena takes precedence over the data input d when determining the output q.\n\nPotential Race Conditions:\n- There are no race conditions anticipated, as the design is intended to operate as a level-sensitive latch.\n\nPlease ensure that all implementation details adhere to the specified behaviors and conditions.\n                    "
