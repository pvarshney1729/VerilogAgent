        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  p1a\n - input  p1b\n - input  p1c\n - input  p1d\n - input  p1e\n - input  p1f\n - input  p2a\n - input  p2b\n - input  p2c\n - input  p2d\n - output p1y\n - output p2y\n\nThe 7458 is a chip with four AND gates and two OR gates. Implement a\nmodule with the same functionality as the 7458 chip. It has 10 inputs and\n2 outputs. You may choose to use an `assign` statement to drive each of\nthe output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as\nintermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of\none of the AND gates.\n\nIn this circuit, p1y should be the OR of two 3-input AND gates: one that\nANDs p1a, p1b, and p1c, and the second that ANDs p1d, p1e, and p1f. The\noutput p2y is the OR of two 2-input AND gates: one that ANDs p2a and p2b,\nand the second that ANDs p2c and p2d.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire p1a;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p1b;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p1c;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p1d;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p1e;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p1f;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p2a;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p2b;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p2c;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire p2d;  // 1-bit input\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire p1y; // 1-bit output\n  - output wire p2y; // 1-bit output\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module replicates the functionality of the 7458 chip, which includes four 3-input AND gates and two 2-input OR gates, resulting in a total of 10 inputs and 2 outputs.\n\n1. Output p1y:\n   - p1y is generated by the logical OR of two 3-input AND gates.\n     - The first AND gate takes inputs p1a, p1b, and p1c.\n     - The second AND gate takes inputs p1d, p1e, and p1f.\n   - The logical expression for p1y can be mathematically represented as:\n     p1y = (p1a AND p1b AND p1c) OR (p1d AND p1e AND p1f)\n\n2. Output p2y:\n   - p2y is generated by the logical OR of two 2-input AND gates.\n     - The first AND gate takes inputs p2a and p2b.\n     - The second AND gate takes inputs p2c and p2d.\n   - The logical expression for p2y can be mathematically represented as:\n     p2y = (p2a AND p2b) OR (p2c AND p2d)\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The module may utilize an `assign` statement to directly drive the output wires or may declare intermediate wire signals to hold the outputs of the AND gates before driving the outputs.\n- Ensure that all signals are driven appropriately, avoiding any race conditions or undriven outputs.\n- All input signals are treated as combinational logic with no sequential behavior involved.\n- The module does not include any clock or reset signals as it operates purely on combinational logic.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The outputs p1y and p2y will be evaluated based on the logical states of the inputs. Any combinations of high and low inputs will be handled without specific edge case conditions.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All input and output ports are considered 1-bit wide. The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].\n                    "
