Functional Description:
This module replicates the functionality of the 7458 chip, which includes four 3-input AND gates and two 2-input OR gates, resulting in a total of 10 inputs and 2 outputs.

1. Output p1y:
   - p1y is generated by the logical OR of two 3-input AND gates.
     - The first AND gate takes inputs p1a, p1b, and p1c.
     - The second AND gate takes inputs p1d, p1e, and p1f.
   - The logical expression for p1y can be mathematically represented as:
     p1y = (p1a AND p1b AND p1c) OR (p1d AND p1e AND p1f)

2. Output p2y:
   - p2y is generated by the logical OR of two 2-input AND gates.
     - The first AND gate takes inputs p2a and p2b.
     - The second AND gate takes inputs p2c and p2d.
   - The logical expression for p2y can be mathematically represented as:
     p2y = (p2a AND p2b) OR (p2c AND p2d)

Implementation Notes:
- The module may utilize an `assign` statement to directly drive the output wires or may declare intermediate wire signals to hold the outputs of the AND gates before driving the outputs.
- Ensure that all signals are driven appropriately, avoiding any race conditions or undriven outputs.
- All input signals are treated as combinational logic with no sequential behavior involved.
- The module does not include any clock or reset signals as it operates purely on combinational logic.

Edge Cases:
- The outputs p1y and p2y will be evaluated based on the logical states of the inputs. Any combinations of high and low inputs will be handled without specific edge case conditions.

Bit Indexing:
- All input and output ports are considered 1-bit wide. The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].
