Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - d: 1-bit input signal representing the data input, where bit[0] is the LSB.
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: 1-bit output signal representing the data output, where bit[0] is the LSB.

Functional Description:
This module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, which mimics the behavior of a flip-flop that captures the input data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. 

Sequential Logic Details:
- The flip-flop shall update its output (q) on both the rising edge (posedge) and falling edge (negedge) of the clock signal (clk).
- The module must ensure that the output q follows the input d, such that:
  - q is updated to the value of d on the rising edge of clk.
  - q is updated to the value of d on the falling edge of clk.

Reset Behavior:
- The module shall include an asynchronous reset input (reset) with the following specifications:
  - Input Port:
    - reset: 1-bit input signal that, when asserted high, resets the output q to a defined initial state.
  - Reset State:
    - When reset is asserted, q shall be set to '0' (logic low).
  
Initial State:
- At power-up or upon assertion of the reset signal, the initial state of output q shall be '0' (logic low).

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is dependent on the input d and the clock signal clk, with precedence given to the clock edge events to determine when to sample d.

Edge Case Behavior:
- The module must handle potential race conditions that could arise from simultaneous changes in d near the clock edges. Ensure that q is stable and reflects the correct value of d during the clock transitions.

This specification ensures clarity in the design and correctness in the implementation of the dual-edge triggered flip-flop functionality.
