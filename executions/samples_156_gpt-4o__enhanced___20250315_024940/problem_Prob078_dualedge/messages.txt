All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  d\n - output q\n\nA dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.\nHowever, FPGAs don't have dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and using an\nalways @(posedge clk or negedge clk) is not accepted as a legal\nsensitivity list. Build a circuit that functionally behaves like a\ndual-edge triggered flip-flop.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n  - d: 1-bit input signal representing the data input, where bit[0] is the LSB.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 1-bit output signal representing the data output, where bit[0] is the LSB.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, which mimics the behavior of a flip-flop that captures the input data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. \n\nSequential Logic Details:\n- The flip-flop shall update its output (q) on both the rising edge (posedge) and falling edge (negedge) of the clock signal (clk).\n- The module must ensure that the output q follows the input d, such that:\n  - q is updated to the value of d on the rising edge of clk.\n  - q is updated to the value of d on the falling edge of clk.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module shall include an asynchronous reset input (reset) with the following specifications:\n  - Input Port:\n    - reset: 1-bit input signal that, when asserted high, resets the output q to a defined initial state.\n  - Reset State:\n    - When reset is asserted, q shall be set to '0' (logic low).\n  \nInitial State:\n- At power-up or upon assertion of the reset signal, the initial state of output q shall be '0' (logic low).\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is dependent on the input d and the clock signal clk, with precedence given to the clock edge events to determine when to sample d.\n\nEdge Case Behavior:\n- The module must handle potential race conditions that could arise from simultaneous changes in d near the clock edges. Ensure that q is stable and reflects the correct value of d during the clock transitions.\n\nThis specification ensures clarity in the design and correctness in the implementation of the dual-edge triggered flip-flop functionality.\n                    "
