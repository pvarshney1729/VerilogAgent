When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - in: [31:0] (32 bits, unsigned)\n    - Description: A 32-bit input vector, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - out: [31:0] (32 bits, unsigned)\n    - Description: A 32-bit output vector that represents the reversed byte order of the input vector.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module shall reverse the byte order of the 32-bit input vector 'in'. The output vector 'out' is generated by reordering the bytes of 'in' such that:\n  - out[7:0] = in[31:24]\n  - out[15:8] = in[23:16]\n  - out[23:16] = in[15:8]\n  - out[31:24] = in[7:0]\n\nBehavioral Characteristics:\n- The reversing operation is combinational logic, meaning the output 'out' is determined solely by the current state of the input 'in'.\n- There are no sequential elements (flip-flops or registers) in this module; thus, no clock or reset signals are required.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure that the module operates correctly for all possible values of the 32-bit input vector, including all zeros (in = 32'b00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000) and all ones (in = 32'b11111111_11111111_11111111_11111111).\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that the bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[31] is the MSB.\n- Confirm that no implicit assumptions about the input values or states are made beyond those stated in the specification.\n                    "
