Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: [31:0] (32 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 32-bit input vector, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: [31:0] (32 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 32-bit output vector that represents the reversed byte order of the input vector.

Functional Description:
- The module shall reverse the byte order of the 32-bit input vector 'in'. The output vector 'out' is generated by reordering the bytes of 'in' such that:
  - out[7:0] = in[31:24]
  - out[15:8] = in[23:16]
  - out[23:16] = in[15:8]
  - out[31:24] = in[7:0]

Behavioral Characteristics:
- The reversing operation is combinational logic, meaning the output 'out' is determined solely by the current state of the input 'in'.
- There are no sequential elements (flip-flops or registers) in this module; thus, no clock or reset signals are required.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure that the module operates correctly for all possible values of the 32-bit input vector, including all zeros (in = 32'b00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000) and all ones (in = 32'b11111111_11111111_11111111_11111111).

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[31] is the MSB.
- Confirm that no implicit assumptions about the input values or states are made beyond those stated in the specification.
