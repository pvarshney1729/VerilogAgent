All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  x\n - input  y (3 bits)\n - output Y0\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement the output logic and next state logic for an\nFSM using the table shown below. Note that the output Y0 is Y[0] of the\nnext state signal.\n\n   Present state input y[2:0] | Next state Y[2:0] when x=0, Next state Y[2:0] when x=1 | Output z\n   000 | 000, 001 | 0\n   001 | 001, 100 | 0\n   010 | 010, 001 | 0\n   011 | 001, 010 | 1\n   100 | 011, 100 | 1\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    The `TopModule` implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following interface. All input and output ports are explicitly defined in terms of width, signedness, and naming conventions. \n\n**Input Ports:**\n- `input clk;`              // Clock signal (1 bit, rising edge triggered)\n- `input x;`                // Control input (1 bit)\n- `input [2:0] y;`          // Current state input (3 bits, unsigned, y[2] is the most significant bit (MSB), y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB))\n\n**Output Ports:**\n- `output Y0;`              // Output Y0 (1 bit, represents Y[0] of the next state signal)\n- `output z;`               // Output z (1 bit)\n\n**FSM State Transition Table:**\nThe FSM behavior is defined by the present state `y[2:0]` and the control input `x`. The next state and output logic are determined as follows:\n\n| Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State if `x=0` | Next State if `x=1` | Output `z` |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| 000                     | 000                  | 001                  | 0           |\n| 001                     | 001                  | 100                  | 0           |\n| 010                     | 010                  | 001                  | 0           |\n| 011                     | 001                  | 010                  | 1           |\n| 100                     | 011                  | 100                  | 1           |\n\n**Sequential Logic:**\n- The FSM transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The state transition is synchronous, meaning the next state is updated based on the current state and inputs after each clock cycle.\n\n**Reset Behavior:**\n- The module shall have a synchronous reset which is not explicitly defined in the current specification.\n- The initial state of the FSM (upon reset) will be state `000`.\n\n**Output Behavior:**\n- The output `Y0` represents the least significant bit of the next state after the FSM has transitioned.\n- The output `z` is determined based on the current state and the value of `x` as specified in the state transition table.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Ensure that the module properly handles transitions when `x` is at its boundaries (0 and 1).\n- The behavior of the FSM must be verified for all combinations of `y[2:0]` and input `x`.\n\n**Signal Dependencies:**\n- The next state is determined by both the current state `y[2:0]` and the input `x`.\n- The output `Y0` and `z` are dependent on the next state determined at the clock edge.\n\n**Potential Race Conditions:**\n- Ensure that all state transitions and output logic occur without race conditions by properly synchronizing on the clock edge.\n\nAll registers and flip-flops within the module must be initialized to their defined reset state upon the synchronous reset condition.\n                    "
