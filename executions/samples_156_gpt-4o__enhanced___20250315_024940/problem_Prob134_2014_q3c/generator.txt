### Explanation of the Code

1. **Module Definition**: The module `TopModule` is defined with the specified ports for inputs and outputs.

2. **Next State Logic**: 
   - An `always @(*)` block is used to define the combinational logic that determines the `next_state` based on the current state `y` and the control input `x`.
   - A `case` statement is used to implement the state transitions according to the provided state transition table.

3. **State Register**: 
   - An `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to update the state on the rising edge of the clock.
   - The reset condition is simulated by checking if the current state `y` equals `3'b000`. This is not a typical reset, but it ensures the state can be reset. For actual synchronous reset behavior, an explicit reset input would be required.

4. **Output Logic**: 
   - The output `Y0` is assigned the least significant bit of the `next_state`.
   - The output `z` is determined based on the current state `y`, where `z` is `1` if the state is `011` or `100`, and `0` otherwise.

5. **Synthesis Considerations**: The use of `logic` for all signals allows proper synthesis and simulation, adhering to the coding conventions specified.

### Note
- The implementation assumes that the reset behavior is based on the current state `y`, as no explicit reset signal was provided. For a proper synchronous reset, an additional reset input would typically be included in the module interface.
