<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The `TopModule` implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following interface. All input and output ports are explicitly defined in terms of width, signedness, and naming conventions. 

**Input Ports:**
- `input clk;`              // Clock signal (1 bit, rising edge triggered)
- `input x;`                // Control input (1 bit)
- `input [2:0] y;`          // Current state input (3 bits, unsigned, y[2] is the most significant bit (MSB), y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB))

**Output Ports:**
- `output Y0;`              // Output Y0 (1 bit, represents Y[0] of the next state signal)
- `output z;`               // Output z (1 bit)

**FSM State Transition Table:**
The FSM behavior is defined by the present state `y[2:0]` and the control input `x`. The next state and output logic are determined as follows:

| Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State if `x=0` | Next State if `x=1` | Output `z` |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 000                     | 000                  | 001                  | 0           |
| 001                     | 001                  | 100                  | 0           |
| 010                     | 010                  | 001                  | 0           |
| 011                     | 001                  | 010                  | 1           |
| 100                     | 011                  | 100                  | 1           |

**Sequential Logic:**
- The FSM transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- The state transition is synchronous, meaning the next state is updated based on the current state and inputs after each clock cycle.

**Reset Behavior:**
- The module shall have a synchronous reset which is not explicitly defined in the current specification.
- The initial state of the FSM (upon reset) will be state `000`.

**Output Behavior:**
- The output `Y0` represents the least significant bit of the next state after the FSM has transitioned.
- The output `z` is determined based on the current state and the value of `x` as specified in the state transition table.

**Edge Cases:**
- Ensure that the module properly handles transitions when `x` is at its boundaries (0 and 1).
- The behavior of the FSM must be verified for all combinations of `y[2:0]` and input `x`.

**Signal Dependencies:**
- The next state is determined by both the current state `y[2:0]` and the input `x`.
- The output `Y0` and `z` are dependent on the next state determined at the clock edge.

**Potential Race Conditions:**
- Ensure that all state transitions and output logic occur without race conditions by properly synchronizing on the clock edge.

All registers and flip-flops within the module must be initialized to their defined reset state upon the synchronous reset condition.
