Here is the implementation of the `TopModule` based on the provided specifications and guidelines:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    input  logic c,
    input  logic d,
    input  logic e,
    output logic [24:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin
        out[24] = (a == a); // Comparison of a with itself
        out[23] = (a == b); // Comparison of a with b
        out[22] = (a == c); // Comparison of a with c
        out[21] = (a == d); // Comparison of a with d
        out[20] = (a == e); // Comparison of a with e
        out[19] = (b == a); // Comparison of b with a
        out[18] = (b == b); // Comparison of b with itself
        out[17] = (b == c); // Comparison of b with c
        out[16] = (b == d); // Comparison of b with d
        out[15] = (b == e); // Comparison of b with e

        out[12] = (c == c); // Comparison of c with itself
        out[11] = (c == d); // Comparison of c with d
        out[10] = (c == e); // Comparison of c with e
        out[ 9] = (d == a); // Comparison of d with a
        out[ 8] = (d == b); // Comparison of d with b

        out[ 6] = (d == d); // Comparison of d with itself
        out[ 5] = (d == e); // Comparison of d with e
        out[ 4] = (e == a); // Comparison of e with a
        out[ 3] = (e == b); // Comparison of e with b
        out[ 2] = (e == c); // Comparison of e with c

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with the input ports `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`, and an output port `out` which is 25 bits wide.
2. **Combinational Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to define the combinational logic. This means that the output `out` will be continuously updated based on the values of the inputs.
3. **Comparison Logic**: Each bit of the output `out` is computed by comparing pairs of inputs:
   - The first few bits compare `a` with all inputs (including itself).
   - This pattern continues for `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`, producing a total of 25 comparisons.
4. **Output Assignment**: The results of the comparisons are assigned to the corresponding bits of the output vector.

This implementation adheres to the specified interface, coding conventions, and logical requirements.
