Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])
  - input wire b (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])
  - input wire c (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])
  - input wire d (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])
  - input wire e (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])
  
- Output Port:
  - output wire [24:0] out (25 bits, unsigned, LSB: out[0])

Functional Description:
The TopModule computes all pairwise one-bit comparisons among the five input signals (a, b, c, d, and e) and produces a 25-bit output vector. Each bit in the output vector corresponds to a comparison between two input bits, where the output bit is set to '1' if the compared bits are equal and '0' if they are not.

Output Mapping:
- out[24] = (a == a)      // Comparison of a with itself
- out[23] = (a == b)      // Comparison of a with b
- out[22] = (a == c)      // Comparison of a with c
- out[21] = (a == d)      // Comparison of a with d
- out[20] = (a == e)      // Comparison of a with e
- out[19] = (b == a)      // Comparison of b with a
- out[18] = (b == b)      // Comparison of b with itself
- out[17] = (b == c)      // Comparison of b with c
- out[16] = (b == d)      // Comparison of b with d
- out[15] = (b == e)      // Comparison of b with e
- out[14] = (c == a)      // Comparison of c with a
- out[13] = (c == b)      // Comparison of c with b
- out[12] = (c == c)      // Comparison of c with itself
- out[11] = (c == d)      // Comparison of c with d
- out[10] = (c == e)      // Comparison of c with e
- out[ 9] = (d == a)      // Comparison of d with a
- out[ 8] = (d == b)      // Comparison of d with b
- out[ 7] = (d == c)      // Comparison of d with c
- out[ 6] = (d == d)      // Comparison of d with itself
- out[ 5] = (d == e)      // Comparison of d with e
- out[ 4] = (e == a)      // Comparison of e with a
- out[ 3] = (e == b)      // Comparison of e with b
- out[ 2] = (e == c)      // Comparison of e with c
- out[ 1] = (e == d)      // Comparison of e with d
- out[ 0] = (e == e)      // Comparison of e with itself

Notes:
- The output bits are indexed from 0 (LSB) to 24 (MSB).
- All comparisons are performed in a combinational logic manner, with no sequential elements or clock dependencies defined for this module.
- The module does not include any reset functionality, as it operates solely based on the current values of the input signals.
