All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - input  c\n - input  d\n - input  e\n - output out (25 bits)\n\nImplement a module that given five 1-bit signals (a, b, c, d, and e),\ncompute all 25 pairwise one-bit comparisons in the 25-bit output vector.\nThe output should be 1 if the two bits being compared are equal. Example:\nout[24] = ~a ^ a; out[23] = ~a ^ b; out[22] = ~a ^ c; ...\nout[ 1] = ~e ^ d; out[ 0] = ~e ^ e.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])\n  - input wire b (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])\n  - input wire c (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])\n  - input wire d (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])\n  - input wire e (1 bit, unsigned, LSB: bit[0])\n  \n- Output Port:\n  - output wire [24:0] out (25 bits, unsigned, LSB: out[0])\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule computes all pairwise one-bit comparisons among the five input signals (a, b, c, d, and e) and produces a 25-bit output vector. Each bit in the output vector corresponds to a comparison between two input bits, where the output bit is set to '1' if the compared bits are equal and '0' if they are not.\n\nOutput Mapping:\n- out[24] = (a == a)      // Comparison of a with itself\n- out[23] = (a == b)      // Comparison of a with b\n- out[22] = (a == c)      // Comparison of a with c\n- out[21] = (a == d)      // Comparison of a with d\n- out[20] = (a == e)      // Comparison of a with e\n- out[19] = (b == a)      // Comparison of b with a\n- out[18] = (b == b)      // Comparison of b with itself\n- out[17] = (b == c)      // Comparison of b with c\n- out[16] = (b == d)      // Comparison of b with d\n- out[15] = (b == e)      // Comparison of b with e\n- out[14] = (c == a)      // Comparison of c with a\n- out[13] = (c == b)      // Comparison of c with b\n- out[12] = (c == c)      // Comparison of c with itself\n- out[11] = (c == d)      // Comparison of c with d\n- out[10] = (c == e)      // Comparison of c with e\n- out[ 9] = (d == a)      // Comparison of d with a\n- out[ 8] = (d == b)      // Comparison of d with b\n- out[ 7] = (d == c)      // Comparison of d with c\n- out[ 6] = (d == d)      // Comparison of d with itself\n- out[ 5] = (d == e)      // Comparison of d with e\n- out[ 4] = (e == a)      // Comparison of e with a\n- out[ 3] = (e == b)      // Comparison of e with b\n- out[ 2] = (e == c)      // Comparison of e with c\n- out[ 1] = (e == d)      // Comparison of e with d\n- out[ 0] = (e == e)      // Comparison of e with itself\n\nNotes:\n- The output bits are indexed from 0 (LSB) to 24 (MSB).\n- All comparisons are performed in a combinational logic manner, with no sequential elements or clock dependencies defined for this module.\n- The module does not include any reset functionality, as it operates solely based on the current values of the input signals.\n                    "
