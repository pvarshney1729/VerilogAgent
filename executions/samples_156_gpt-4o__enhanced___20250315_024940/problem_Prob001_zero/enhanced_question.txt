Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Ports:
  - zero: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned)
    - Description: The output 'zero' will always output a logic LOW (0).

Functional Description:
- The module is combinational logic that continuously drives the output port 'zero' to a logic LOW state (0) regardless of any input signals.

Behavior at Edge Cases:
- There are no input signals affecting the output; hence, no edge cases for input signals need to be defined.

Implementation Notes:
- The output 'zero' does not change state and is not dependent on any clock cycles or resets.

Reset Behavior:
- There are no reset signals or states associated with this module as it is designed to continuously output a LOW state.

Initial Values:
- The output 'zero' is initialized to a LOW state (0) upon instantiation.

Signal Dependencies:
- There are no signal dependencies as the module does not have any input ports or internal state.
