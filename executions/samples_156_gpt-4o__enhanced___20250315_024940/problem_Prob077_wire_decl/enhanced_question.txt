Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: 1-bit input (unsigned)
  - input wire b: 1-bit input (unsigned)
  - input wire c: 1-bit input (unsigned)
  - input wire d: 1-bit input (unsigned)
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: 1-bit output (unsigned)
  - output wire out_n: 1-bit output (unsigned)

Circuit Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit comprising two layers of gates.

Layer 1:
- Two 2-input AND gates are utilized:
  - AND Gate 1: Takes inputs from 'a' and 'b'. The output of this gate will be referred to as `and_output1`.
  - AND Gate 2: Takes inputs from 'c' and 'd'. The output of this gate will be referred to as `and_output2`.

Layer 2:
- A single 2-input OR gate takes inputs from `and_output1` and `and_output2`. The output of this OR gate is assigned to the output port 'out'.

Inversion:
- The output port 'out_n' is the logical negation of the output port 'out', defined as follows:
  - out_n = NOT(out)

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that the outputs are driven by the results of the AND gates, with no additional wires needed for the output of the NOT operation.
- All signals must have exactly one driver, adhering to the combinational logic design principles.

Edge Cases:
- All input signals (a, b, c, d) are assumed to be either 0 or 1, and the behavior of 'out' and 'out_n' should be clearly defined for all combinations of these inputs.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic without state elements.

This specification should ensure that the implementation of the TopModule is clear, unambiguous, and correct.
