Based on your requirements and the guidelines provided, here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule`. The module implements the specified combinational logic using two AND gates, one OR gate, and provides an inverted output.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    input logic d,
    output logic out,
    output logic out_n
);

    logic and_output1;
    logic and_output2;

    // First layer: two AND gates
    assign and_output1 = a & b; // AND gate for inputs a and b
    assign and_output2 = c & d; // AND gate for inputs c and d

    // Second layer: OR gate
    assign out = and_output1 | and_output2; // OR gate for the outputs of the AND gates

    // Inverted output
    assign out_n = ~out; // NOT gate for output out

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input and Output Declaration**: All ports are declared as `logic` type as per the conventions specified.
2. **Intermediate Wires**: Two intermediate signals (`and_output1` and `and_output2`) are declared to hold the outputs of the AND gates.
3. **Combinational Logic**: The AND gates are implemented using the `assign` statements, where `and_output1` is the result of `a & b` and `and_output2` is the result of `c & d`.
4. **OR Gate**: The output `out` is generated by OR-ing the two AND outputs.
5. **Inversion**: The output `out_n` is simply the negation of `out`, achieved with the `~` operator.

This implementation adheres to the specified guidelines and ensures that all signals are driven by exactly one source, maintaining combinational logic integrity.
