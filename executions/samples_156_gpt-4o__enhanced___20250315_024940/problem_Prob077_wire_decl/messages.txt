        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - input  c\n - input  d\n - output out\n - output out_n\n\nThe module should implement the following circuit. Create two\nintermediate wires (named anything you want) to connect the AND and OR\ngates together. Note that the wire that feeds the NOT gate is really wire\n`out`, so you do not necessarily need to declare a third wire here.\nNotice how wires are driven by exactly one source (output of a gate), but\ncan feed multiple inputs.\n\nThe circuit is composed of two layers. The first layer, counting from the\ninput, is two AND gates: one whose input is connected to a and b, and the\nsecond is connected to c and d. The second layer there is an OR gate to\nOR the two AND outputs, connected the output 'out'. Additionally, there\nis an inverted output 'out_n'.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a: 1-bit input (unsigned)\n  - input wire b: 1-bit input (unsigned)\n  - input wire c: 1-bit input (unsigned)\n  - input wire d: 1-bit input (unsigned)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out: 1-bit output (unsigned)\n  - output wire out_n: 1-bit output (unsigned)\n\nCircuit Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic circuit comprising two layers of gates.\n\nLayer 1:\n- Two 2-input AND gates are utilized:\n  - AND Gate 1: Takes inputs from 'a' and 'b'. The output of this gate will be referred to as `and_output1`.\n  - AND Gate 2: Takes inputs from 'c' and 'd'. The output of this gate will be referred to as `and_output2`.\n\nLayer 2:\n- A single 2-input OR gate takes inputs from `and_output1` and `and_output2`. The output of this OR gate is assigned to the output port 'out'.\n\nInversion:\n- The output port 'out_n' is the logical negation of the output port 'out', defined as follows:\n  - out_n = NOT(out)\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- Ensure that the outputs are driven by the results of the AND gates, with no additional wires needed for the output of the NOT operation.\n- All signals must have exactly one driver, adhering to the combinational logic design principles.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- All input signals (a, b, c, d) are assumed to be either 0 or 1, and the behavior of 'out' and 'out_n' should be clearly defined for all combinations of these inputs.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic without state elements.\n\nThis specification should ensure that the implementation of the TopModule is clear, unambiguous, and correct.\n                    "
