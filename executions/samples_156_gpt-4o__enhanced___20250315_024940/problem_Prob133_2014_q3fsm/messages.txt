All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  s\n - input  w\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine with inputs s and w.\nAssume that the FSM begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below.\nThe FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when\ns = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the\nnext three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles,\nthen the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle.\nOtherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three\nclock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s\ninput is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.\nAssume reset is active high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is\ntriggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: bit (1-bit input, rising edge-triggered clock signal)\n  - reset: bit (1-bit input, active high synchronous reset signal)\n  - s: bit (1-bit input)\n  - w: bit (1-bit input)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - z: bit (1-bit output)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with two states: State A and State B. The FSM behavior is as follows:\n\n1. Initial State:\n   - The FSM begins in State A upon power-up or when the reset signal is asserted (reset = 1). In this state, the output z is initially set to 0.\n\n2. State A:\n   - The FSM remains in State A as long as the input s = 0. \n   - If s transitions to 1 (s = 1), the FSM changes its state to State B on the next positive edge of the clock.\n\n3. State B:\n   - Upon entering State B, the FSM will observe the value of the input w for the next three clock cycles (counting from the clock edge when the FSM transitioned to State B).\n   - After three clock cycles, if the value of w equals 1 for exactly two of those cycles (i.e., the input w has the pattern 110, 101, or 011), then the output z is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.\n   - If w does not equal 1 in exactly two of the three clock cycles, then z is set to 0 on the following clock cycle.\n   - The FSM continues to check the input w in subsequent sequences of three clock cycles, resetting the count after each evaluation.\n\n4. Reset Behavior:\n   - The reset signal is active high and synchronous. Upon reset, all internal registers and states are initialized to their defined states, with the FSM starting in State A and output z set to 0.\n\n5. Timing:\n   - All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).\n   - The transitions between states and the output z will occur on the rising edge of clk.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If reset is asserted while in State B, the FSM must immediately return to State A and set z to 0.\n- If s is toggled during State B, the FSM will not return to State A until the next reset or the next clock edge where s = 0.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The FSM's transition from State A to State B depends solely on the input s.\n- The evaluation of the output z is dependent on the value of w over the specified three clock cycles after the state transition to State B.\n\nState Encoding:\n- The FSM should use the minimum number of states necessary to achieve the required functionality while maintaining clarity in state transitions and output behavior.\n                    "
