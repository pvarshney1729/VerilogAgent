Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge triggered)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset signal)
  - x: 1-bit input (data signal)

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output (result signal)

State Encoding:
The module implements a Mealy finite-state machine (FSM) using one-hot encoding for the states. The following states are defined:
- State A: 2'b01 (active)
- State B: 2'b10 (active)

Reset Behavior:
- The FSM resets into State A when the areset signal is asserted (high).
- The reset is asynchronous, meaning the state will reset immediately upon areset being high, regardless of the clk signal.

State Transition and Output Logic:
The state transitions and output behavior are defined as follows:

1. From State A:
   - If x = 0, remain in State A and output z = 0.
   - If x = 1, transition to State B and output z = 1.

2. From State B:
   - If x = 0, remain in State B and output z = 1.
   - If x = 1, remain in State B and output z = 0.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic (state transitions) are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal. The state of the FSM is updated on the rising edge of clk.

Initial Condition:
- Upon reset (when areset is high), the FSM should initialize to State A.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle the case when areset is asserted while clk is high, ensuring that the FSM resets immediately to State A.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that the output z is immediately updated based on the current state and the input x.
- There should be no race conditions; the outputs are determined solely by the current state and the input x.

Bit Indexing:
- All input and output signals are defined as single bits where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Compliance:
- The implementation must adhere strictly to the above specifications to ensure correct functionality of the 2's complementer as a Mealy FSM.
