All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  areset\n - input  x\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement the following Mealy finite-state machine\nwhich is an implementation of the 2's complementer. Implement using a\none-hot encoding. Resets into state A and reset is asynchronous\nactive-high.\n\n  A --x=0 (z=0)--> A\n  A --x=1 (z=1)--> B\n  B --x=0 (z=1)--> B\n  B --x=1 (z=0)--> B\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge triggered)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset signal)\n  - x: 1-bit input (data signal)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - z: 1-bit output (result signal)\n\nState Encoding:\nThe module implements a Mealy finite-state machine (FSM) using one-hot encoding for the states. The following states are defined:\n- State A: 2'b01 (active)\n- State B: 2'b10 (active)\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The FSM resets into State A when the areset signal is asserted (high).\n- The reset is asynchronous, meaning the state will reset immediately upon areset being high, regardless of the clk signal.\n\nState Transition and Output Logic:\nThe state transitions and output behavior are defined as follows:\n\n1. From State A:\n   - If x = 0, remain in State A and output z = 0.\n   - If x = 1, transition to State B and output z = 1.\n\n2. From State B:\n   - If x = 0, remain in State B and output z = 1.\n   - If x = 1, remain in State B and output z = 0.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential logic (state transitions) are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal. The state of the FSM is updated on the rising edge of clk.\n\nInitial Condition:\n- Upon reset (when areset is high), the FSM should initialize to State A.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle the case when areset is asserted while clk is high, ensuring that the FSM resets immediately to State A.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- Ensure that the output z is immediately updated based on the current state and the input x.\n- There should be no race conditions; the outputs are determined solely by the current state and the input x.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All input and output signals are defined as single bits where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nCompliance:\n- The implementation must adhere strictly to the above specifications to ensure correct functionality of the 2's complementer as a Mealy FSM.\n                    "
