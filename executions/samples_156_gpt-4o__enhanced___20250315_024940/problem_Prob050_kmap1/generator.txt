Generated Response:

Based on the specifications and guidelines provided, here is the implementation for the `TopModule`. The code uses combinational logic to derive the output `out` based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, as described by the Karnaugh map.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    input  logic c,
    output logic out
);

    // Combinational logic derived from the Karnaugh map
    always @(*) begin
        out = (b & c) | (a & (b | c)) | (b & ~a);
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The module `TopModule` is defined with the specified inputs and output.
2. All ports are declared as `logic` as required.
3. The combinational logic is implemented within an `always @(*)` block to ensure that the output `out` is computed based on the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. The logic expression `(b & c) | (a & (b | c)) | (b & ~a)` corresponds to the conditions derived from the Karnaugh map, ensuring that `out` is set high for the correct combinations of inputs.

This implementation adheres to the provided interface, guidelines, and coding conventions while correctly inferring the logic based on the given Karnaugh map.
