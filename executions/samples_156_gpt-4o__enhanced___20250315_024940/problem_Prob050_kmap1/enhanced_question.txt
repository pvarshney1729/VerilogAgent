Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: 1-bit input (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  - b: 1-bit input (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  - c: 1-bit input (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)

Functional Description:
The module shall implement the combinational logic circuit defined by the provided Karnaugh map, which describes the relationship between the inputs (a, b, c) and the output (out). The output is defined by the following truth table derived from the Karnaugh map:

| a | b | c | out |
|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0   |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1   |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1   |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1   |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1   |

- The output `out` will be high (1) for the following input combinations:
  - (a=0, b=0, c=1)
  - (a=0, b=1, c=0)
  - (a=0, b=1, c=1)
  - (a=1, b=0, c=0)
  - (a=1, b=0, c=1)
  - (a=1, b=1, c=0)
  - (a=1, b=1, c=1)

Implementation Notes:
- The module implements purely combinational logic and does not include any sequential elements.
- There are no resets or clock cycles involved in this specification as it is entirely combinational.
- The output `out` must be computed based solely on the current values of inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, without any stored state.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all combinations of the input signals (a, b, c) as specified above.
- There are no undefined states or transitions in the context of this combinational logic design.
