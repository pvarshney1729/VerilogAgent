Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the first variable of the function
  - input wire b [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the second variable of the function
  - input wire c [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the third variable of the function
  - input wire d [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the fourth variable of the function

- Output Port:
  - output wire out [1 bit, unsigned] // Result of the combinational logic based on inputs a, b, c, and d

Karnaugh Map Representation:
The module implements the following logic function based on the provided Karnaugh map:

             ab
  cd   00  01  11  10
  00 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |
  01 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
  11 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |
  10 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |

- Function Definition:
  The output 'out' is defined as follows based on the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd':
  - out = (c' d' b) + (c d' a) + (c' d a) + (c d b')

  Where:
  - c' denotes the complement (NOT) of c
  - d' denotes the complement (NOT) of d

- Bit Indexing:
  - The most significant bit (MSB) is 'a' and the least significant bit (LSB) is 'd'.
  - Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] refers to the LSB (d), and bit[3] refers to the MSB (a).

- Logic Type:
  - The output 'out' is derived from combinational logic based on the inputs a, b, c, and d.
  - There are no sequential elements, and therefore no clock cycles or reset states are relevant in this specification.

- Edge Cases:
  - When any input (a, b, c, d) is at its boundary (0 or 1), the output 'out' should reflect the logic defined in the Karnaugh map without any undefined states.

- Signal Dependencies:
  - The output 'out' is solely dependent on the current values of inputs a, b, c, and d. There are no additional dependencies.

- Race Conditions:
  - As this is a purely combinational circuit with no memory elements, race conditions are not a concern.

Initial Conditions:
- The module does not include any flip-flops or registers; thus, there are no initial values to specify.

Please ensure that the implementation adheres strictly to this clarified specification to maintain functional correctness.
