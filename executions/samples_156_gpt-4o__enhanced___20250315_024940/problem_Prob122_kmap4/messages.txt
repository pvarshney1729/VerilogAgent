All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - input  c\n - input  d\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement the Karnaugh map below.\n\n             ab\n  cd   00  01  11  10\n  00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n  11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the first variable of the function\n  - input wire b [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the second variable of the function\n  - input wire c [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the third variable of the function\n  - input wire d [1 bit, unsigned] // Controls the fourth variable of the function\n\n- Output Port:\n  - output wire out [1 bit, unsigned] // Result of the combinational logic based on inputs a, b, c, and d\n\nKarnaugh Map Representation:\nThe module implements the following logic function based on the provided Karnaugh map:\n\n             ab\n  cd   00  01  11  10\n  00 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |\n  01 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |\n  11 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |\n  10 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |\n\n- Function Definition:\n  The output 'out' is defined as follows based on the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd':\n  - out = (c' d' b) + (c d' a) + (c' d a) + (c d b')\n\n  Where:\n  - c' denotes the complement (NOT) of c\n  - d' denotes the complement (NOT) of d\n\n- Bit Indexing:\n  - The most significant bit (MSB) is 'a' and the least significant bit (LSB) is 'd'.\n  - Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] refers to the LSB (d), and bit[3] refers to the MSB (a).\n\n- Logic Type:\n  - The output 'out' is derived from combinational logic based on the inputs a, b, c, and d.\n  - There are no sequential elements, and therefore no clock cycles or reset states are relevant in this specification.\n\n- Edge Cases:\n  - When any input (a, b, c, d) is at its boundary (0 or 1), the output 'out' should reflect the logic defined in the Karnaugh map without any undefined states.\n\n- Signal Dependencies:\n  - The output 'out' is solely dependent on the current values of inputs a, b, c, and d. There are no additional dependencies.\n\n- Race Conditions:\n  - As this is a purely combinational circuit with no memory elements, race conditions are not a concern.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The module does not include any flip-flops or registers; thus, there are no initial values to specify.\n\nPlease ensure that the implementation adheres strictly to this clarified specification to maintain functional correctness.\n                    "
