Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 100 bits
  - Definition: in[99:0] where in[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and in[99] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
  - Signedness: Unsigned

- Output:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 100 bits
  - Definition: out[99:0] where out[0] corresponds to the least significant bit (LSB) and out[99] corresponds to the most significant bit (MSB).
  - Signedness: Unsigned

Functionality:
- The module shall implement a combinational logic function that reverses the bit order of the input signal. Specifically, the output signal out shall be defined as:
  - out[0] = in[99]
  - out[1] = in[98]
  - ...
  - out[98] = in[1]
  - out[99] = in[0]

Behavioral Characteristics:
- The module shall have no internal state, as it is purely combinational.
- There are no clock edges or sequential elements in this design.
- There is no reset mechanism as this is not a sequential circuit.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all 100-bit input values, including all possible combinations of ‘0’ and ‘1’ in the input vector. The output will reflect the exact reversed bit order for all valid 100-bit input values.
