Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a;  // 1-bit input, representing the first select input
  - input wire b;  // 1-bit input, representing the second select input
  - input wire sel; // 1-bit input, control signal for selection

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out; // 1-bit output, the selected output from the multiplexer

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a 1-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer with the following behavior:
- When sel = 1'b0 (where 'b' indicates binary):
  - out shall be assigned the value of input a (i.e., out = a).
- When sel = 1'b1:
  - out shall be assigned the value of input b (i.e., out = b).

Signal Definitions:
- The input signals a, b, and sel are treated as unsigned 1-bit values.
- The output signal out is also treated as an unsigned 1-bit value.

Edge Cases:
- The module shall ensure that the output out is always driven according to the value of sel, with no undefined states.

Timing and Logic:
- The selection of the output is a combinational logic operation and is not dependent on any clock signal.
- There are no sequential elements or state retention in this module; thus, no reset behavior is applicable.

Potential Race Conditions:
- Ensure that there are no race conditions in the signal assignment by maintaining a clear combinational logic path.

Note: All input/output ports are explicitly defined as 1-bit wide to avoid ambiguity.
