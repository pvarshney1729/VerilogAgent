Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal) 
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: 4-bit output (binary counter value) 
    - q[3:0]: bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Specification:
- The module shall implement a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15, inclusive, with a reset functionality.
- The counter increments its value on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The counter shall wrap around to 0 after reaching 15, effectively creating a counting period of 16.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal (reset) is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (high), the counter (q) shall be set to 0 (0000).
- The counter shall only reset on the positive edge of the clk when reset is asserted.

Sequential Logic:
- The counter shall be implemented using flip-flops that are clocked on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The counter state (q) shall be updated in accordance with the following behavior:
  - If reset is low (deasserted), on the next rising edge of clk, if the counter is less than 15, it shall increment by 1.
  - If the counter reaches 15, it shall reset to 0 on the next increment.

Edge Cases:
- When reset is asserted, q should immediately be set to 0 regardless of the current counter state.
- When clk transitions from low to high, and reset is not asserted, the counter should follow the specified counting behavior.

Initialization:
- Upon instantiation, the counter value (q) shall be initialized to 0 (0000) in the event that reset is not asserted during the first clk cycle.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset inputs, with precedence given to the reset signal during its active state.
