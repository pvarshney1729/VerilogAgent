Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - vec: bit[2:0] (3 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 3-bit vector input where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] is the most significant bit (MSB).
  
- Output Ports:
  - outv: bit[2:0] (3 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 3-bit output that directly reflects the input vector 'vec'. 
  - o0: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Outputs the value of vec[0], corresponding to the LSB of the input vector.
  - o1: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Outputs the value of vec[1], corresponding to the second bit of the input vector.
  - o2: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Outputs the value of vec[2], corresponding to the MSB of the input vector.

Logic Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit with no sequential elements. 
- The outputs are determined directly from the input 'vec' as follows:
  - o0 = vec[0]
  - o1 = vec[1]
  - o2 = vec[2]
  - outv = vec

Reset Behavior:
- There are no reset signals defined in this module.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible values of 'vec' (000 to 111) without any undefined behavior.

Signal Dependencies:
- The outputs 'o0', 'o1', 'o2', and 'outv' are dependent solely on the 'vec' input with no additional conditions or operations.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the output assignments are made in a manner that reflects the input vector with correct mapping to individual output signals.
