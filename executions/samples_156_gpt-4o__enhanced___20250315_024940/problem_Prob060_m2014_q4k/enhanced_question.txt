Module Name: TopModule

Input/Output Ports:
- Input:
  - clk: 1-bit input (active on the rising edge)
  - resetn: 1-bit input (active-low synchronous reset)
  - in: 1-bit input (data to be shifted into the register)
  
- Output:
  - out: 1-bit output (the most significant bit of the shift register)

Port Widths:
- All input and output ports are defined as 1-bit wide.

Bit Indexing:
- The bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
The module implements a 4-bit shift register composed of four D flip-flops (DFFs). The DFFs are arranged in a series where the output of each DFF connects to the input of the next DFF, facilitating the shift operation. 

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The behavior of the shift register during each clock cycle is as follows:
  - On the rising edge of clk:
    - If resetn is low (active), all flip-flops are reset to '0'.
    - If resetn is high (inactive), each DFF captures the input signal from the previous stage:
      - DFF0 (LSB) captures the input signal 'in'.
      - DFF1 captures the output of DFF0.
      - DFF2 captures the output of DFF1.
      - DFF3 (MSB) captures the output of DFF2.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and active-low. When resetn is low, all DFFs are reset to '0'.

Initial Values:
- Upon reset (resetn = 0), all DFFs (DFF0, DFF1, DFF2, DFF3) are initialized to '0'.

Output Behavior:
- The output 'out' is assigned the value of DFF3 (the most significant bit of the shift register).

Edge Cases:
- Consider the behavior when the input signal 'in' is asserted immediately after reset; the output 'out' will remain '0' on the next clock cycle until the input is shifted into the register.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure the correct sequencing of signals to avoid race conditions, particularly during the reset condition and the capturing of inputs in the DFFs.
