All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  x\n - input  y\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement the boolean function z = (x^y) & x.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire x;  // 1-bit input, unsigned, representing the first operand\n  - input wire y;  // 1-bit input, unsigned, representing the second operand\n\n- Output Port:\n  - output wire z;  // 1-bit output, unsigned, representing the result of the boolean function\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements the boolean function z = (x XOR y) AND x.\n- The output z is derived from the following operations:\n  1. Compute the XOR of inputs x and y, denoted as (x ^ y).\n  2. Perform a bitwise AND operation between the result of the XOR and input x, resulting in z.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n- The output z is combinational logic and is updated whenever there is a change in inputs x or y.\n- There are no sequential elements, flip-flops, or registers in this design.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module\u2019s behavior is well-defined for all input combinations of x and y (0 or 1). It does not require special handling of edge cases as it operates on single-bit inputs.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output z depends directly on both input signals x and y without any intermediate states or timing dependencies.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- There are no reset conditions in this combinational module, as it does not include any storage elements.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Inputs x and y are provided in a valid binary format (0 or 1).\n- The module does not handle any asynchronous or synchronous resets, as it does not maintain state.\n\nEnd of Specification.\n                    "
