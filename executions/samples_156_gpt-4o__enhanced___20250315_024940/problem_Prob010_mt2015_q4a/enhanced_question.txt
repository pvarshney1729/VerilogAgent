<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire x;  // 1-bit input, unsigned, representing the first operand
  - input wire y;  // 1-bit input, unsigned, representing the second operand

- Output Port:
  - output wire z;  // 1-bit output, unsigned, representing the result of the boolean function

Functionality:
- The module implements the boolean function z = (x XOR y) AND x.
- The output z is derived from the following operations:
  1. Compute the XOR of inputs x and y, denoted as (x ^ y).
  2. Perform a bitwise AND operation between the result of the XOR and input x, resulting in z.

Behavioral Specification:
- The output z is combinational logic and is updated whenever there is a change in inputs x or y.
- There are no sequential elements, flip-flops, or registers in this design.

Edge Cases:
- The moduleâ€™s behavior is well-defined for all input combinations of x and y (0 or 1). It does not require special handling of edge cases as it operates on single-bit inputs.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z depends directly on both input signals x and y without any intermediate states or timing dependencies.

Reset Behavior:
- There are no reset conditions in this combinational module, as it does not include any storage elements.

Assumptions:
- Inputs x and y are provided in a valid binary format (0 or 1).
- The module does not handle any asynchronous or synchronous resets, as it does not maintain state.

End of Specification.
