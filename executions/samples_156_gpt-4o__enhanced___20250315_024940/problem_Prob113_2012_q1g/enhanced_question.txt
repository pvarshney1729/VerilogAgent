Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - x: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 4-bit input vector where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).
- Output Ports:
  - f: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: A single-bit output representing the result of the function defined by the Karnaugh map.

Functional Description:
The output f is determined by the following Karnaugh map, which represents a combinational logic function based on the input vector x:

             x[0] x[1]
x[2] x[3]  00    01    11    10
  00     |  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
  01     |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
  11     |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
  10     |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |

Truth Table:
The truth table for the function f based on the input vector x is as follows:

| x[3] | x[2] | x[1] | x[0] | f |
|------|------|------|------|---|
|  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   | 1 |
|  0   |  0   |  0   |  1   | 0 |
|  0   |  0   |  1   |  0   | 0 |
|  0   |  0   |  1   |  1   | 1 |
|  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   | 0 |
|  0   |  1   |  0   |  1   | 0 |
|  0   |  1   |  1   |  0   | 0 |
|  0   |  1   |  1   |  1   | 0 |
|  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   | 1 |
|  1   |  0   |  0   |  1   | 1 |
|  1   |  0   |  1   |  0   | 0 |
|  1   |  0   |  1   |  1   | 1 |
|  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   | 0 |
|  1   |  1   |  0   |  1   | 0 |
|  1   |  1   |  1   |  0   | 1 |
|  1   |  1   |  1   |  1   | 0 |

Design Considerations:
- The module implements combinational logic without any clocking elements.
- Ensure that the output f does not have any undefined states for the input range of x[3:0].
- The implementation should not include race conditions, and dependencies among inputs should be clearly defined according to the truth table and Karnaugh map.

Edge Cases:
- The behavior of f should be well-defined for all possible combinations of x[3:0] ranging from 0000 to 1111 (0 to 15 in decimal).
