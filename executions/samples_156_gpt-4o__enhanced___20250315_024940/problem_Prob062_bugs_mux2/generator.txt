The original implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer has a bug in the assignment of the `out` signal. The output is declared as a single-bit signal, but it should be an 8-bit signal since we are working with 8-bit inputs `a` and `b`. To fix this issue, I will update the output declaration and assignment accordingly.

Here's the corrected Verilog code for the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning:
1. **Output Declaration**: Changed the output `out` from `output` to `output [7:0]` to reflect that it is an 8-bit output.
2. **Assign Statement**: Updated the assignment statement to use a conditional operator (`? :`), which is a more concise and clear way to implement the multiplexer logic. If `sel` is 1, `out` will be assigned the value of `b`; otherwise, it will be assigned the value of `a`.
3. **Correct Signal Types**: Ensured all ports are declared correctly as per the updated requirements.

This implementation now correctly reflects the intended functionality of the multiplexer.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;

endmodule
