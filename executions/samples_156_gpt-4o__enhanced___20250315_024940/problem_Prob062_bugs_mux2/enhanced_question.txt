<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Consider the following implementation of an 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux):

Module Name: TopModule

**Input Ports:**
- `input sel`: 1-bit select signal where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB). This signal determines which input to pass to the output.
- `input [7:0] a`: 8-bit input signal `a`, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).
- `input [7:0] b`: 8-bit input signal `b`, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the MSB.

**Output Port:**
- `output [7:0] out`: 8-bit output signal, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the MSB. This output reflects the selected input based on the value of the `sel` signal.

**Functional Description:**
The output `out` is assigned based on the value of the `sel` signal as follows:
- If `sel` is 0, then `out` will be equal to `a`.
- If `sel` is 1, then `out` will be equal to `b`.

**Logic Type:**
This module is purely combinational logic, meaning the output is a direct function of the inputs without any memory elements such as flip-flops.

**Signal Dependencies:**
There are no dependencies on clock signals or sequential logic in this implementation. The output will change immediately in response to changes in the input signals.

**Edge Cases:**
- There are no specific edge cases to address in this combinational logic design since the output will always reflect the state of the inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel` without any timing issues.

**Reset Conditions:**
No reset conditions are defined for this module, as it does not include any sequential logic.

**Initial Values:**
Since this is a combinational module, initial values are not applicable.

**Race Conditions:**
There are no potential race conditions in this implementation, as the output is determined purely by the current state of the inputs.

This specification clarifies the intended functionality of the 2-to-1 multiplexer and addresses the previous ambiguity in output assignment.
