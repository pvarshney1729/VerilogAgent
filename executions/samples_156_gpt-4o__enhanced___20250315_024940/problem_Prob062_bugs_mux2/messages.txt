When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Consider the following implementation of an 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux):\n\nModule Name: TopModule\n\n**Input Ports:**\n- `input sel`: 1-bit select signal where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB). This signal determines which input to pass to the output.\n- `input [7:0] a`: 8-bit input signal `a`, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n- `input [7:0] b`: 8-bit input signal `b`, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the MSB.\n\n**Output Port:**\n- `output [7:0] out`: 8-bit output signal, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the MSB. This output reflects the selected input based on the value of the `sel` signal.\n\n**Functional Description:**\nThe output `out` is assigned based on the value of the `sel` signal as follows:\n- If `sel` is 0, then `out` will be equal to `a`.\n- If `sel` is 1, then `out` will be equal to `b`.\n\n**Logic Type:**\nThis module is purely combinational logic, meaning the output is a direct function of the inputs without any memory elements such as flip-flops.\n\n**Signal Dependencies:**\nThere are no dependencies on clock signals or sequential logic in this implementation. The output will change immediately in response to changes in the input signals.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- There are no specific edge cases to address in this combinational logic design since the output will always reflect the state of the inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel` without any timing issues.\n\n**Reset Conditions:**\nNo reset conditions are defined for this module, as it does not include any sequential logic.\n\n**Initial Values:**\nSince this is a combinational module, initial values are not applicable.\n\n**Race Conditions:**\nThere are no potential race conditions in this implementation, as the output is determined purely by the current state of the inputs.\n\nThis specification clarifies the intended functionality of the 2-to-1 multiplexer and addresses the previous ambiguity in output assignment.\n                    "
