Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input signed [7:0] a: 8-bit two's complement number, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).
  - input signed [7:0] b: 8-bit two's complement number, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the MSB.
  
- Output Ports:
  - output signed [7:0] s: 8-bit result of the addition, where bit[0] is the LSB and bit[7] is the MSB.
  - output overflow: 1-bit signal indicating whether a signed overflow has occurred during the addition operation.

Functional Description:
- The module shall compute the sum of the two input numbers a and b, producing the output s, as follows:
  s = a + b
- The overflow signal shall be set to high (1) if a signed overflow occurs during the addition. Specifically, overflow occurs if:
  - Both a and b are positive (i.e., a[7] = 0 and b[7] = 0) and s[7] = 1 (the sign bit of the result is negative).
  - Both a and b are negative (i.e., a[7] = 1 and b[7] = 1) and s[7] = 0 (the sign bit of the result is positive).
- The module shall handle the addition and overflow detection as combinational logic, meaning the outputs will be updated immediately based on the inputs without any clock cycle dependencies.

Edge Cases:
- The module shall correctly handle the boundary values of a and b, including minimum (-128) and maximum (127) values for signed 8-bit integers.

Reset Behavior:
- No reset mechanism is defined for this module, as it operates purely on combinational logic without any state retention.

Initialization:
- No explicit initialization of outputs is required as there is no stateful behavior in this combinational design.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output s and overflow are directly dependent on the inputs a and b and will be recalculated whenever the values of a or b change.
