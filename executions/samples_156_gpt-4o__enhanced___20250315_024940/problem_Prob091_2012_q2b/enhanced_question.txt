Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - y: 6-bit input (y[5:0]), where:
    - y[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and y[5] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
    - Bit representation follows one-hot encoding: 
      - 000001 represents state A,
      - 000010 represents state B,
      - 000100 represents state C,
      - 001000 represents state D,
      - 010000 represents state E,
      - 100000 represents state F.
  - w: 1-bit input (w)

- Output Ports:
  - Y1: 1-bit output (Y1)
  - Y3: 1-bit output (Y3)

Finite-State Machine (FSM) Description:
The FSM consists of the following states and transitions:
1. State A (y = 000001):
   - Input 1: Transition to state B (y = 000010)
   - Input 0: Remain in state A (y = 000001)

2. State B (y = 000010):
   - Input 1: Transition to state C (y = 000100)
   - Input 0: Transition to state D (y = 001000)

3. State C (y = 000100):
   - Input 1: Transition to state E (y = 010000)
   - Input 0: Transition to state D (y = 001000)

4. State D (y = 001000):
   - Input 1: Transition to state F (y = 100000)
   - Input 0: Transition to state A (y = 000001)

5. State E (y = 010000):
   - Input 1: Remain in state E (y = 010000)
   - Input 0: Transition to state D (y = 001000)

6. State F (y = 100000):
   - Input 1: Transition to state C (y = 000100)
   - Input 0: Transition to state D (y = 001000)

Output Logic:
- The output signal Y1 should be driven by the state of flip-flop y[1].
- The output signal Y3 should be driven by the state of flip-flop y[3].

Sequential Logic:
- The module will implement sequential logic to determine the state transitions based on the input w.
- All state flip-flops (y[1] and y[3]) must have defined reset states; specify whether the resets are synchronous or asynchronous.
- Define the initial values for all flip-flops upon reset.

Edge Case Handling:
- Clearly specify behavior for edge cases, including possible inputs such as simultaneous transitions or invalid states.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure all output signals and state transitions are dependent on the defined inputs and state conditions.
- Specify the precedence of operations to avoid potential race conditions during state transitions.
