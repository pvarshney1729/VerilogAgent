Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Inputs:
  - input [3:0] a : 4-bit input (unsigned)
  - input [3:0] b : 4-bit input (unsigned)
  - input [3:0] c : 4-bit input (unsigned)
  - input [3:0] d : 4-bit input (unsigned)
  - input [3:0] e : 4-bit input (unsigned)
  
- Outputs:
  - output [3:0] q : 4-bit output (unsigned)

Specification:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The output q will depend on the inputs a, b, c, d, and e based on specific conditions as observed in the simulation waveforms provided.

Input/Output Timing:
- The behavior of the module will be evaluated based on the simulation waveform timings provided below:
  
  | Time (ns) | a | b | c | d | e | q |
  |-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0         | x | x | x | x | x | x |
  | 5         | x | x | x | x | x | x |
  | 10        | x | x | x | x | x | x |
  | 15        | a | b | 0 | d | e | b |
  | 20        | a | b | 1 | d | e | e |
  | 25        | a | b | 2 | d | e | a |
  | 30        | a | b | 3 | d | e | d |
  | 35        | a | b | 4 | d | e | f |
  | 40        | a | b | 5 | d | e | f |
  | 45        | a | b | 6 | d | e | f |
  | 50        | a | b | 7 | d | e | f |
  | 55        | a | b | 8 | d | e | f |
  | 60        | a | b | 9 | d | e | f |
  | 65        | a | b | a | d | e | f |
  | 70        | a | b | b | d | e | f |
  | 75        | a | b | c | d | e | f |
  | 80        | a | b | d | d | e | f |
  | 85        | a | b | e | d | e | f |
  | 90        | a | b | f | d | e | f |

Notes:
- The values above indicate the relationship between the inputs and the output at various simulation time points.
- The implementation must ensure that the output q is computed based on the specified conditions and does not change unless the input values change, maintaining combinational logic behavior.
