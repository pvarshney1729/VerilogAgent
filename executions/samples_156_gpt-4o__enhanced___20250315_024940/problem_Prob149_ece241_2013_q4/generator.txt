Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` as per the specifications and guidelines provided:

```verilog

module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic reset,
    input  logic [2:0] s,
    output logic fr2,
    output logic fr1,
    output logic fr0,
    output logic dfr
);

    // State to hold previous sensor level
    logic [2:0] prev_s;

    // Always block for sequential logic (with synchronous reset)
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Reset all outputs and previous state
            fr2 <= 1'b1;
            fr1 <= 1'b1;
            fr0 <= 1'b1;
            dfr <= 1'b0;
            prev_s <= 3'b000; // No sensors asserted
        end else begin
            // Update previous state to current state
            prev_s <= s;

            // Flow control logic based on sensor states
            if (s[2]) begin
                // Above s[2]
                fr2 <= 1'b0;
                fr1 <= 1'b0;
                fr0 <= 1'b0;
                dfr <= 1'b0;
            end else if (s[1]) begin
                // Between s[2] and s[1]

                dfr <= (prev_s[2] == 1'b0) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; // Increase flow if previous was lower
            end else if (s[0]) begin
                // Between s[1] and s[0]
                fr2 <= 1'b0;
                fr1 <= 1'b1;
                fr0 <= 1'b1;
                dfr <= (prev_s[1:0] == 2'b00) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; // Increase flow if previous was lower
            end else begin
                // Below s[0]
                fr2 <= 1'b1;
                fr1 <= 1'b1;
                fr0 <= 1'b1;
                dfr <= 1'b0;
            end
        end
    end

    // Assign outputs to logic values
    assign fr2 = fr2;

### Reasoning:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with the required input and output ports.
2. **State Variables**: A logic variable `prev_s` is declared to hold the previous state of the sensors.
3. **Synchronous Reset**: The always block uses a clock edge to sample the `reset` signal. If `reset` is high, all outputs are set to their reset states, and `prev_s` is initialized to indicate no sensors are asserted.
4. **Flow Logic**: Depending on the state of the sensor inputs `s`, the flow rate control signals `fr2`, `fr1`, `fr0`, and `dfr` are assigned based on the logic provided in the specification. The logic checks which sensors are asserted and adjusts the outputs accordingly.
5. **Output Wiring**: Outputs are assigned within the sequential block, ensuring they reflect the correct values based on the sensor states and previous states.

This implementation adheres to all guidelines and conventions specified, ensuring that the functionality of the module aligns with the described behavior.
