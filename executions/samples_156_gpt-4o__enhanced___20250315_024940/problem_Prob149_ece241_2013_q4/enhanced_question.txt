Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input clk: 1-bit clock signal (rising edge triggered).
  - input reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the module state is reset to a condition as if the water level has been low for an extended period.
  - input s: 3-bit sensor input (s[2:0]), where:
    - s[2] is the most significant bit (MSB) representing the highest sensor.
    - s[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) representing the lowest sensor.
  
- Output Ports:
  - output fr2: 1-bit flow rate control signal for maximum flow (asserted when water level is below the lowest sensor).
  - output fr1: 1-bit flow rate control signal for intermediate flow.
  - output fr0: 1-bit flow rate control signal for nominal flow.
  - output dfr: 1-bit signal to control the opening of the Supplemental flow valve. Asserted when the water level increases compared to the previous level.

Functionality Description:
The module controls the flow rate of water based on the state of three vertical sensors, which detect the water level at 5-inch intervals. The flow rate behavior is defined as follows:

1. When the water level is above the highest sensor (s[2] asserted):
   - Output: fr2 = 0, fr1 = 0, fr0 = 0, dfr = 0.

2. When the water level is between the highest sensor (s[2]) and the middle sensor (s[1]):
   - Outputs: fr2 = 0, fr1 = 0, fr0 = 1, dfr is determined by previous level indication.

3. When the water level is between the middle sensor (s[1]) and the lowest sensor (s[0]):
   - Outputs: fr2 = 0, fr1 = 1, fr0 = 1, dfr is determined by previous level indication.

4. When the water level is below the lowest sensor (s[0] not asserted):
   - Outputs: fr2 = 1, fr1 = 1, fr0 = 1, dfr = 0.

The flow rate control signal dfr is activated when there is an increase in the water level (previous level lower than the current level).

Reset Conditions:
Upon the assertion of the reset signal:
- All outputs (fr2, fr1, fr0, dfr) are set to 1 (indicating maximum flow rate as if no sensors are asserted).

State Dependencies:
- The outputs depend on the current state of the sensors (s[2:0]) and the previous state of the water level to determine the appropriate flow rate adjustments. 

Edge Cases:
- If the input signal s transitions quickly, ensure that the outputs reflect the proper flow rate based on the most recent water level detected.
- Ensure that there is no race condition between the sensor state changes and the flow control outputs.

Ensure that all sequential elements (e.g., registers for tracking previous water levels) are initialized to a known state upon reset.
