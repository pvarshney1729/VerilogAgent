        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - x: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Represents the first operand for addition. \n  - y: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Represents the second operand for addition. \n\n- Output Port:\n  - sum: bit[4:0] (5 bits, unsigned) - Represents the result of the addition, with the most significant bit (MSB) serving as the overflow indicator.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module implements a 4-bit binary adder using full adder logic. The addition operation will compute the sum of the inputs x and y and provide a 5-bit output. The output 'sum' will include the 4-bit result of the addition in bits[3:0] (LSB to MSB) and an overflow indicator in bit[4], which signals if an overflow occurred during the addition.\n\nBehavior:\n- The addition will be performed on the rising edge of a clock signal (not specified in the original). Therefore, the module should be synchronized to a clock input. \n- The sum output will be valid after one clock cycle following the rising edge of the clock when the inputs x and y are stable.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When both x and y are at their maximum value (i.e., 4'b1111), the sum output should correctly indicate an overflow by setting bit[4] to 1 and the lower 4 bits (bits[3:0]) to 4'b0000.\n- Other combinations of x and y should result in appropriate values in the sum output without causing any undefined behavior.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- A synchronous reset signal should be implemented (not specified in the original). This reset will clear the sum output to 5'b00000 when activated.\n\nInitial Values:\n- On reset, the output 'sum' shall be initialized to 5'b00000.\n\nConsiderations:\n- Ensure that all combinational logic implementing the addition of x and y is appropriately defined to avoid race conditions.\n- Clearly document any dependencies and precedence of operations in the implementation.\n                    "
