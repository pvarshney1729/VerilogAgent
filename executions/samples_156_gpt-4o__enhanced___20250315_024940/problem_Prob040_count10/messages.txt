All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - output q (4 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a decade counter that counts from 0 through\n9, inclusive, with a period of 10. Assume all sequential logic is\ntriggered on the positive edge of the clock. The reset input is active\nhigh synchronous, and should reset the counter to 0.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. This signal is used to trigger the sequential logic on the positive edge.\n  - reset: 1-bit input representing the reset signal. This signal is active high and is used for synchronous reset of the counter.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 4-bit output representing the current count of the decade counter. The bit indexing is defined as follows: \n    - q[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB)\n    - q[3] refers to the most significant bit (MSB)\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, and then resets back to 0, completing a full cycle every 10 clock cycles.\n- The counter should increment on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset input is active high and synchronous. When the reset signal is asserted (set to '1'), the counter output (q) will be reset to '0000' (binary representation of 0) on the next positive edge of clk.\n\nInitial Values:\n- Upon reset, all bits of the output q (q[3:0]) are initialized to '0000'.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The counter must ensure that it does not exceed the value of 9. After reaching 9, the next positive edge of clk should reset the counter back to 0 if the reset signal is not asserted.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is solely dependent on the clk and reset inputs. There are no other external signals that influence the counter's operation.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions between the reset and clock edges.\n\nClarity on Count Sequence:\n- The count sequence is as follows: 0 (0000) \u2192 1 (0001) \u2192 2 (0010) \u2192 3 (0011) \u2192 4 (0100) \u2192 5 (0101) \u2192 6 (0110) \u2192 7 (0111) \u2192 8 (1000) \u2192 9 (1001) \u2192 0 (0000).\n\nTiming:\n- Assume a clock period sufficient to accommodate the operations of the counter without timing violations.\n                    "
