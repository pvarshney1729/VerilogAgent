All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  in\n - output done\n\nIn many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent\nalong with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes\nfrom the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8\ndata bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing\nis being transmitted (idle).\n\nImplement a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been\ncorrectly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the\nstart bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was\ncorrect. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait\nuntil it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.\nInclude a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol\nsends the least significant bit first.\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: bit (1-bit wide, positive edge-triggered)\n  - reset: bit (1-bit wide, active-high synchronous reset)\n  - in: bit (1-bit wide, represents incoming serial data)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - done: bit (1-bit wide, indicates completion of byte reception)\n\nProtocol Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) designed to receive data bytes according to a standard serial communication protocol consisting of:\n- 1 Start Bit (value: 0)\n- 8 Data Bits (LSB first)\n- 1 Stop Bit (value: 1)\nThe line is at logic high (1) when idle, meaning no data is being transmitted.\n\nFunctional Operation:\n1. The FSM shall identify the start bit (0) to signify the beginning of a byte.\n2. Upon detecting the start bit, the FSM will proceed to receive 8 data bits in the following order:\n   - Bit[0]: Least Significant Bit (LSB)\n   - Bit[7]: Most Significant Bit (MSB)\n3. After receiving the data bits, the FSM will expect a stop bit (1) to complete the byte reception.\n4. If the stop bit does not appear after the expected reception of 8 data bits, the FSM must remain in the current state until a valid stop bit is detected before attempting to receive a new byte.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset input is active-high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), all internal state registers must be initialized to a known state, which includes:\n  - Resetting the FSM to the idle state.\n  - Ensuring that the output signal 'done' is deasserted (0).\n\nTiming and Dependencies:\n- All sequential logic, including state transitions and data reception, is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- Ensure there are no race conditions by clearly defining the order of operations within the FSM.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM shall properly handle cases where noise or invalid signals occur before a valid start bit and ensure robust detection of start and stop bits.\n- The FSM should maintain its state during periods of idle (logic high) until a valid start bit is detected.\n\nState Definitions:\n- Clearly define all states required for the FSM:\n  - Idle State\n  - Start Bit State\n  - Data Bit Reception States (8 states for each data bit)\n  - Stop Bit State\n  - Error State (if applicable)\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- The output signal 'done' should transition to high (1) once a complete byte has been correctly received, meaning a valid start bit was detected, followed by 8 valid data bits, and a valid stop bit was received.\n                    "
