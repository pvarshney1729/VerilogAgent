Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: bit (1-bit wide, positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: bit (1-bit wide, active-high synchronous reset)
  - in: bit (1-bit wide, represents incoming serial data)
  
- Output Ports:
  - done: bit (1-bit wide, indicates completion of byte reception)

Protocol Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) designed to receive data bytes according to a standard serial communication protocol consisting of:
- 1 Start Bit (value: 0)
- 8 Data Bits (LSB first)
- 1 Stop Bit (value: 1)
The line is at logic high (1) when idle, meaning no data is being transmitted.

Functional Operation:
1. The FSM shall identify the start bit (0) to signify the beginning of a byte.
2. Upon detecting the start bit, the FSM will proceed to receive 8 data bits in the following order:
   - Bit[0]: Least Significant Bit (LSB)
   - Bit[7]: Most Significant Bit (MSB)
3. After receiving the data bits, the FSM will expect a stop bit (1) to complete the byte reception.
4. If the stop bit does not appear after the expected reception of 8 data bits, the FSM must remain in the current state until a valid stop bit is detected before attempting to receive a new byte.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset input is active-high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), all internal state registers must be initialized to a known state, which includes:
  - Resetting the FSM to the idle state.
  - Ensuring that the output signal 'done' is deasserted (0).

Timing and Dependencies:
- All sequential logic, including state transitions and data reception, is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- Ensure there are no race conditions by clearly defining the order of operations within the FSM.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM shall properly handle cases where noise or invalid signals occur before a valid start bit and ensure robust detection of start and stop bits.
- The FSM should maintain its state during periods of idle (logic high) until a valid start bit is detected.

State Definitions:
- Clearly define all states required for the FSM:
  - Idle State
  - Start Bit State
  - Data Bit Reception States (8 states for each data bit)
  - Stop Bit State
  - Error State (if applicable)

Output Behavior:
- The output signal 'done' should transition to high (1) once a complete byte has been correctly received, meaning a valid start bit was detected, followed by 8 valid data bits, and a valid stop bit was received.
