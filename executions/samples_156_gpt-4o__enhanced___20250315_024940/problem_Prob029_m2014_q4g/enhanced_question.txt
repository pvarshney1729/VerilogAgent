Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in1; // 1-bit input, represents the first input signal
  - input wire in2; // 1-bit input, represents the second input signal
  - input wire in3; // 1-bit input, represents the third input signal

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out; // 1-bit output, represents the result of the logic operations

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit with the following functionality:
1. Compute the XNOR of 'in1' and 'in2':
   - Let XNOR_output = in1 XNOR in2
2. Compute the XOR of the XNOR_output and 'in3':
   - Let out = XNOR_output XOR in3

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' depends on both the states of 'in1', 'in2', and 'in3'. 
- The operations are performed as follows:
   - First, calculate the XNOR between 'in1' and 'in2'.
   - Then, take the result from the XNOR and compute the XOR with 'in3' to produce 'out'.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The module should be capable of handling all possible combinations of the inputs (0 and 1). 
- Ensure that the XNOR and XOR operations are defined for all combinations of the input signals.

Clock and Reset:
- This module is purely combinational and does not have any clock or reset signals.

Initial Conditions:
- Not applicable as this is a combinational logic module; no registers or flip-flops are utilized.
