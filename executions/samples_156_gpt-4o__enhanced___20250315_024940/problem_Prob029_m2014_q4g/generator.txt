Generated Response:

Here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` as per your specifications and guidelines:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic in1,  // 1-bit input
    input logic in2,  // 1-bit input
    input logic in3,  // 1-bit input
    output logic out  // 1-bit output
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = (in1 ~^ in2) ^ in3; // Compute XNOR of in1 and in2, then XOR with in3
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has the defined input and output ports.
2. **Port Declaration**: All ports are declared as `logic`, adhering to the requirement to avoid using `wire` or `reg`.
3. **Combinational Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to represent combinational logic, which computes the output based on the current values of the inputs.
4. **Logic Operations**: The XNOR operation is represented by `~^`, and the XOR operation is represented by `^`. The output is calculated as the result of the XNOR of `in1` and `in2`, further XORed with `in3`.
5. **No Clock or Reset**: Since this is a combinational module, there are no clock or reset signals involved.

This implementation fulfills all the requirements specified in the question, ensuring proper logic and syntax as per Verilog standards.

module TopModule (
    input logic in1,  // 1-bit input
    input logic in2,  // 1-bit input
    input logic in3,  // 1-bit input
    output logic out  // 1-bit output
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = (in1 ~^ in2) ^ in3; // Compute XNOR of in1 and in2, then XOR with in3
    end
