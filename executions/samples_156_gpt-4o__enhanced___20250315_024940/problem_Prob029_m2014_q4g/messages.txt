All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in1\n - input  in2\n - input  in3\n - output out\n\nThe module should impement the following circuit: A two-input XNOR\n(connected to 'in1' and 'in2) has an output connected to the input of a\ntwo-input XOR. The second input of the XOR is 'in3.' The output of the\nXOR is 'out'.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire in1; // 1-bit input, represents the first input signal\n  - input wire in2; // 1-bit input, represents the second input signal\n  - input wire in3; // 1-bit input, represents the third input signal\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out; // 1-bit output, represents the result of the logic operations\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic circuit with the following functionality:\n1. Compute the XNOR of 'in1' and 'in2':\n   - Let XNOR_output = in1 XNOR in2\n2. Compute the XOR of the XNOR_output and 'in3':\n   - Let out = XNOR_output XOR in3\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'out' depends on both the states of 'in1', 'in2', and 'in3'. \n- The operations are performed as follows:\n   - First, calculate the XNOR between 'in1' and 'in2'.\n   - Then, take the result from the XNOR and compute the XOR with 'in3' to produce 'out'.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The module should be capable of handling all possible combinations of the inputs (0 and 1). \n- Ensure that the XNOR and XOR operations are defined for all combinations of the input signals.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- This module is purely combinational and does not have any clock or reset signals.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Not applicable as this is a combinational logic module; no registers or flip-flops are utilized.\n                    "
