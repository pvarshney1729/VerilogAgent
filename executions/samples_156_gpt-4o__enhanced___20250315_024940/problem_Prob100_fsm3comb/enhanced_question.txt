Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: 1-bit, unsigned (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  - state: 2 bits, unsigned (bit[1] is the most significant bit, bit[0] is the least significant bit)
  
- Output Ports:
  - next_state: 2 bits, unsigned (bit[1] is the most significant bit, bit[0] is the least significant bit)
  - out: 1-bit, unsigned

Functional Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D, encoded as follows:
- State A: 2'b00
- State B: 2'b01
- State C: 2'b10
- State D: 2'b11

State Transition Logic:
The next_state and output (out) are determined based on the following state transition table:

| Current State (state) | Input (in) | Next State (next_state) | Output (out) |
|-----------------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| A (2'b00)             | 0          | A (2'b00)                | 0            |
| A (2'b00)             | 1          | B (2'b01)                | 0            |
| B (2'b01)             | 0          | C (2'b10)                | 0            |
| B (2'b01)             | 1          | B (2'b01)                | 0            |
| C (2'b10)             | 0          | A (2'b00)                | 0            |
| C (2'b10)             | 1          | D (2'b11)                | 0            |
| D (2'b11)             | 0          | C (2'b10)                | 1            |
| D (2'b11)             | 1          | B (2'b01)                | 1            |

Implementation Notes:
- The module should only implement the combinational logic for state transition and output generation. 
- There are no sequential elements or clock cycles defined within this specification as it focuses solely on combinational logic.
- Ensure that the output (out) aligns with the state transitions as defined above.
- The module does not incorporate any reset logic, thus it is assumed that the initial state is A (2'b00) upon power-up or reset unless specified otherwise.
- The behavior of the module at edge cases and input boundaries has been defined through the state transition table.
