### Reasoning
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with the specified input and output ports.
2. **Input and Output Types**: The input `in` is declared as a 255-bit logic vector and the output `out` is an 8-bit logic vector.
3. **Combinational Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to ensure that the output `out` is continuously updated based on the input `in`.
4. **Count Calculation**: The code initializes a count variable to zero and uses a `for` loop to iterate over each bit in the input vector, incrementing the count for each '1' encountered.
5. **Output Assignment**: The computed count is assigned to the output `out`, reflecting the total number of '1's in the input vector.

This implementation adheres to the provided specifications and coding conventions, ensuring that the population count is computed accurately.
