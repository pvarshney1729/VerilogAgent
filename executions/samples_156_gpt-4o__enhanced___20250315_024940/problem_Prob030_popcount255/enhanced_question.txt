Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input [254:0] in: A 255-bit wide input vector. The least significant bit (LSB) is bit [0], and the most significant bit (MSB) is bit [254]. The input is unsigned.

- Output Ports:
  - output [7:0] out: An 8-bit wide output representing the population count of '1's in the input vector. The output is unsigned, with bit [0] as the LSB and bit [7] as the MSB.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit to perform a population count on the 255-bit input vector. The population count circuit calculates the total number of bits set to '1' in the input vector and generates an 8-bit output that reflects this count.

Behavioral Requirements:
- The output 'out' shall represent the total number of '1's in 'in', with valid outputs ranging from 0 to 255, corresponding to the maximum population count of the input vector.
- The population count should be computed continuously based on the input vector 'in', with no need for clock cycles or resets since it is purely combinational in nature.

Edge Cases:
- If the input vector 'in' is all '0's, the output 'out' should be 8'b00000000.
- If the input vector 'in' has all bits set to '1', the output 'out' should be 8'b11111111.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the value of the input 'in' at any given moment.

Precedence of Operations:
- The population count logic must evaluate all bits of the input vector simultaneously to ensure accurate counting without race conditions.
