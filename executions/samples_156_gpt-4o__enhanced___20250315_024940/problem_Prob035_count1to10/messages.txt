        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - output q (4 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a decade counter that counts 1 through 10,\ninclusive. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge\nof the clock. The reset input is active high synchronous, and should\nreset the counter to 1.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge triggered)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset signal)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 4-bit output (represents the current count value of the decade counter, bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB))\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a decade counter that counts from 1 through 10 (inclusive).\n- The counter should reset to the value of 1 when the reset signal is asserted (active high).\n- Counting occurs on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The counter output (q) will hold values in the range of 0001 (1) to 1010 (10) in binary.\n- The counter should not count beyond 10; upon reaching 10, the next count should reset to 1.\n- The reset signal will take precedence over the counting sequence; when active, it will force the counter to 1 regardless of the current count.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The counting operation is to be executed within a synchronous process triggered by the rising edge of the clk.\n- The reset operation is synchronous; thus, the counter's state will only be updated with the reset condition checked alongside the clock edge.\n\nInitial State:\n- The initial state of the counter (q) shall be set to 0001 (binary representation of decimal 1) upon the first positive clock edge following a reset assertion.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The counter must handle transitions from 10 back to 1 smoothly without any glitches or undefined states.\n- If reset is asserted while the counter is currently at a value other than 1, it should immediately transition to 1 on the next clk positive edge.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The counter's value (q) is directly dependent on the clk and reset signals, with reset taking priority over the counting logic.\n                    "
