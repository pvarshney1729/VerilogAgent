Module A
- **Function**: Implements the Boolean function \( z = (x \oplus y) \land x \).
- **Inputs**:
  - `input [0:0] x`: 1-bit input representing the first operand. The least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0].
  - `input [0:0] y`: 1-bit input representing the second operand. The least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0].
- **Output**:
  - `output [0:0] z`: 1-bit output representing the result of the Boolean function.

Module B
- **Behavior**: The output `z` is determined by the following timing behavior:
  - When `x = 0` and `y = 0`, `z` remains `1` for the duration of the initial 20 ns.
  - At `t = 25 ns`, when `x = 1` and `y = 0`, `z` transitions to `0`.
  - At `t = 35 ns`, when `x = 0` and `y = 1`, `z` remains `0`.
  - At `t = 45 ns`, when `x = 1` and `y = 1`, `z` transitions to `1` and remains `1` until `t = 55 ns`.
  - At `t = 55 ns`, when `x = 0` and `y = 0`, `z` becomes `1`.
  - At `t = 60 ns`, when `x = 0` and `y = 1`, `z` returns to `0`.
  - At `t = 70 ns`, when `x = 1` and `y = 1`, `z` transitions to `1` again.
  - Finally, at `t = 90 ns`, when `x = 1` and `y = 0`, `z` returns to `0`.

Top-Level Module
- **Interface**:
  - `input [0:0] x`: 1-bit input.
  - `input [0:0] y`: 1-bit input.
  - `output [0:0] z`: 1-bit output.

- **Implementation**:
  - Instantiate two instances of Module A and two instances of Module B.
  - Connect the first input (`x`) of all four submodules to the top-level `input x`.
  - Connect the second input (`y`) of all four submodules to the top-level `input y`.
  - Connect the output of the first instance of Module A to a two-input OR gate, along with the output of the first instance of Module B.
  - Connect the outputs of the second instances of Module A and Module B to a two-input AND gate.
  - The outputs of the OR gate and the AND gate are connected to an XOR gate.
  - The output of the XOR gate is the top-level output `z`.

- **Signal Dependencies**:
  - Ensure that the output `z` depends on the outputs of both the OR and AND gates.
  - Specify that all operations are combinational with no race conditions expected due to the clear dependency structure.

- **Reset Behavior**:
  - Specify that there is no reset mechanism defined in this specification; all registers and outputs maintain their states based on the input combinations without initialization.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Specify behavior for all combinations of `x` and `y`, confirming that any undefined states are not present in the specified timing behavior.
