<ENHANCED_SPEC>
**Module Name:** TopModule

**Interface:**
- **Input Ports:**
  - **a:** 1-bit input (unsigned)
  - **b:** 1-bit input (unsigned)
  - **c:** 1-bit input (unsigned)

- **Output Ports:**
  - **w:** 1-bit output (unsigned)
  - **x:** 1-bit output (unsigned)
  - **y:** 1-bit output (unsigned)
  - **z:** 1-bit output (unsigned)

**Port Connections:**
- The output port **w** shall be connected to the input port **a** such that:
  - **w = a**
  
- The output port **x** shall be connected to the input port **b** such that:
  - **x = b**
  
- The output port **y** shall also be connected to the input port **b** such that:
  - **y = b**
  
- The output port **z** shall be connected to the input port **c** such that:
  - **z = c**

**Logic Type:**
- The connections specified above are purely combinational logic.

**Bit Indexing:**
- For all ports, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

**Reset Conditions:**
- The module does not include any flip-flops or registers, therefore, no reset conditions are required.

**Edge Cases:**
- The module is designed to operate correctly for all possible input combinations of the 1-bit inputs (0 or 1).

**Signal Dependencies:**
- Outputs are directly dependent on their respective inputs with no additional logic or conditions applied.

**Race Conditions:**
- There are no race conditions present as this design is purely combinational with direct connections.
