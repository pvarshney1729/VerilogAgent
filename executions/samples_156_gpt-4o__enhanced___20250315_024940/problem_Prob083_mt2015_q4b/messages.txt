All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  x\n - input  y\n - output z\n\nThe module can be described by the following simulation waveform:\n\n  time  x  y  z\n  0ns   0  0  1\n  5ns   0  0  1\n  10ns  0  0  1\n  15ns  0  0  1\n  20ns  0  0  1\n  25ns  1  0  0\n  30ns  1  0  0\n  35ns  0  1  0\n  40ns  0  1  0\n  45ns  1  1  1\n  50ns  1  1  1\n  55ns  0  0  1\n  60ns  0  1  0\n  65ns  0  1  0\n  70ns  1  1  1\n  75ns  0  1  0\n  80ns  0  1  0\n  85ns  0  1  0\n  90ns  1  0  0\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription: This module implements a digital logic circuit with specific input and output behavior as defined by the simulation waveform.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire x [1 bit]: Represents the first input signal. \n  - input wire y [1 bit]: Represents the second input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire z [1 bit]: Represents the output signal.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The least significant bit (LSB) is denoted as bit[0]. Both input and output ports are single-bit signals.\n\nLogic Type:\n- The module implements combinational logic based on the given input signals x and y to produce output z.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset condition is defined for this module. The behavior is strictly based on the inputs x and y.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output z depends solely on the current values of inputs x and y.\n- Precedence of operations is straightforward as there are no asynchronous or synchronous elements involved.\n\nBehavior:\n- The module exhibits the following behavior as defined by the simulation waveform provided:\n  - When x = 0 and y = 0, z = 1 (held constant for 20ns).\n  - When x = 1 and y = 0, z = 0 (held constant for 10ns).\n  - When x = 0 and y = 1, z = 0 (held constant for 10ns).\n  - When x = 1 and y = 1, z = 1 (held constant for 10ns).\n  - The output z reflects the defined states based on the combinations of x and y.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The output z must be evaluated for all possible combinations of x and y (00, 01, 10, 11).\n- Ensure to handle transitions at the specified time intervals (5ns increments) correctly.\n\nTiming Diagram:\n- The timing behavior is specified through a series of time points:\n  - At 0ns to 20ns: (0, 0) -> z = 1\n  - At 25ns to 35ns: (1, 0) -> z = 0\n  - At 40ns to 45ns: (0, 1) -> z = 0\n  - At 50ns to 60ns: (1, 1) -> z = 1\n  - Subsequent transitions show a cyclic output based on the input combinations.\n\nNo race conditions are expected due to the nature of the combinational logic and the defined inputs.\n                    "
