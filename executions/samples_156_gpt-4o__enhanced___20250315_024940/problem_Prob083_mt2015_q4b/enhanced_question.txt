Module Name: TopModule

Description: This module implements a digital logic circuit with specific input and output behavior as defined by the simulation waveform.

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire x [1 bit]: Represents the first input signal. 
  - input wire y [1 bit]: Represents the second input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - output wire z [1 bit]: Represents the output signal.

Bit Indexing:
- The least significant bit (LSB) is denoted as bit[0]. Both input and output ports are single-bit signals.

Logic Type:
- The module implements combinational logic based on the given input signals x and y to produce output z.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset condition is defined for this module. The behavior is strictly based on the inputs x and y.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z depends solely on the current values of inputs x and y.
- Precedence of operations is straightforward as there are no asynchronous or synchronous elements involved.

Behavior:
- The module exhibits the following behavior as defined by the simulation waveform provided:
  - When x = 0 and y = 0, z = 1 (held constant for 20ns).
  - When x = 1 and y = 0, z = 0 (held constant for 10ns).
  - When x = 0 and y = 1, z = 0 (held constant for 10ns).
  - When x = 1 and y = 1, z = 1 (held constant for 10ns).
  - The output z reflects the defined states based on the combinations of x and y.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The output z must be evaluated for all possible combinations of x and y (00, 01, 10, 11).
- Ensure to handle transitions at the specified time intervals (5ns increments) correctly.

Timing Diagram:
- The timing behavior is specified through a series of time points:
  - At 0ns to 20ns: (0, 0) -> z = 1
  - At 25ns to 35ns: (1, 0) -> z = 0
  - At 40ns to 45ns: (0, 1) -> z = 0
  - At 50ns to 60ns: (1, 1) -> z = 1
  - Subsequent transitions show a cyclic output based on the input combinations.

No race conditions are expected due to the nature of the combinational logic and the defined inputs.
