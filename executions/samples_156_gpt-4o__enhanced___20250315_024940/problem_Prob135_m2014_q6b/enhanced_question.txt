Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - y (input, 3 bits, unsigned): Represents the current state of the FSM.
    - Bit indexing: y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB), corresponding to the least significant state.
  - w (input, 1 bit, unsigned): Represents an external input used for state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - Y1 (output, 1 bit, unsigned): Represents the value of the second bit of the current state (y[1]).

State Machine Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states and transitions:
- States are defined as:
  - A (000) = 0
  - B (001) = 1
  - C (010) = 2
  - D (011) = 3
  - E (100) = 4
  - F (101) = 5

- State Transition Table:
  - Current State (y) | Input (w) | Next State (y_next)
  - A (000)          | 0         | B (001)
  - A (000)          | 1         | A (000)
  - B (001)          | 0         | C (010)
  - B (001)          | 1         | D (011)
  - C (010)          | 0         | E (100)
  - C (010)          | 1         | D (011)
  - D (011)          | 0         | F (101)
  - D (011)          | 1         | A (000)
  - E (100)          | 0         | E (100)
  - E (100)          | 1         | D (011)
  - F (101)          | 0         | C (010)
  - F (101)          | 1         | D (011)

Implementation Details:
- The FSM shall be implemented using three flip-flops (D-type).
- Only the next-state logic for y[1] needs to be implemented.
- The output Y1 shall be directly assigned the value of y[1].

Clocking and Reset:
- The FSM operates on a rising edge clock signal.
- The reset mechanism is asynchronous and active high, initializing the state to A (000) when activated.

Initialization:
- All flip-flops must have an explicit initial value of A (000) upon reset.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle transitions based on the defined state table, ensuring that invalid states do not occur.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that the state transitions are executed based on the current state and the value of input w, maintaining correct precedence and avoiding race conditions.
