Module Name: TopModule

Input/Output Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (synchronous clock signal, rising edge triggered)
  - w: 1-bit input (data input from the previous stage of the shift register)
  - R: 1-bit input (data value to load into the register when L is asserted)
  - E: 1-bit input (enable signal for shifting; when high, shifting occurs)
  - L: 1-bit input (load signal; when high, the value from R is loaded into the register)

- Output Ports:
  - Q: 1-bit output (current value stored in the register)

Bit Indexing:
- All input and output signals are treated as single bits, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
- The module operates as a single stage of an n-bit shift register.
- The output Q should reflect the following behavior based on the input signals:
  - If L is asserted (high), the output Q should load the value of R, regardless of the state of E.
  - If L is not asserted (low) and E is asserted (high), the output Q should take the value of w (shift in the new data).
  - If both L and E are deasserted (low), the output Q retains its previous value (no change).

Sequential Logic:
- The module shall use a D flip-flop to store the output Q, which is updated on the rising edge of clk.

Reset Behavior:
- The module does not specify an asynchronous reset. It is assumed that the initial state of Q is defined by the behavior described above.
- The initial state of Q is undefined unless specified by an external reset mechanism.

Edge Cases:
- When both L and E are asserted (high), the priority is given to loading the value from R into Q.
- The module must be evaluated for race conditions where L and E may change simultaneously; in such cases, loading from R takes precedence.

Signal Dependencies:
- Q is dependent on the values of R, w, E, and L at the rising edge of clk.
- Ensure that the module handles input changes at the clock edge correctly without introducing metastability.

Timing Relationships:
- All operations occur on the rising edge of the clk signal, ensuring proper synchronization with other stages of the shift register.
