### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with the specified input and output ports.
2. **Sequential Logic**: An `always` block is used to define the behavior of the D flip-flop. The logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).
3. **Load and Shift Logic**:
   - When the load signal (`L`) is asserted, the module loads the value from `R` into `Q`.
   - If `L` is not asserted and the enable signal (`E`) is asserted, the module shifts in the value from `w`.
   - If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, `Q` retains its previous value.
4. **Initialization**: The `initial` block ensures that `Q` is set to `0` at the start of the simulation, complying with the requirement for initialization.
5. **No Reset Handling**: Since there is no asynchronous reset in the specification, this design does not include any such logic.

This implementation adheres strictly to the provided interface and guidelines, ensuring correct functionality for a single stage of an n-bit shift register.
