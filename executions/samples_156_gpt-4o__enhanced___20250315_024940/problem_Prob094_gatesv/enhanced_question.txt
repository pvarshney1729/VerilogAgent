Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input in [3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 4-bit input vector where in[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and in[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - output out_both [3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: Indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbor to the left are '1'.
  - output out_any [3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: Indicates whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbor to the right are '1'.
  - output out_different [3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: Indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbor to the left.

Functional Specifications:
1. out_both:
   - out_both[0] = '0' // No left neighbor for in[0].
   - out_both[1] = in[1] & in[0]
   - out_both[2] = in[2] & in[1]
   - out_both[3] = in[3] & in[2]

2. out_any:
   - out_any[0] = '0' // No right neighbor for in[0].
   - out_any[1] = in[1] | in[0]
   - out_any[2] = in[2] | in[1]
   - out_any[3] = in[3] | in[2]

3. out_different:
   - out_different[0] = (in[0] != in[3]) // Wrap around comparison
   - out_different[1] = (in[1] != in[0])
   - out_different[2] = (in[2] != in[1])
   - out_different[3] = (in[3] != in[2])

Implementation Notes:
- All outputs (out_both, out_any, out_different) shall be evaluated combinationally based on the input vector 'in'.
- No sequential logic or clock signals are involved in this module.
- Edge cases: The outputs out_both[0] and out_any[0] are defined to be '0' due to the absence of neighbors.
- All bit indexing is specified based on the convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
