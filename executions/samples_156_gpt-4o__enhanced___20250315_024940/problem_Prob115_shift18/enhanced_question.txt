Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (Clock signal)
  - load: 1-bit input (Load signal, active high)
  - ena: 1-bit input (Enable signal for shifting, active high)
  - amount: 2-bit input (Shift amount and direction)
    - bit[1:0] indexing: 
      - bit[0]: Least Significant Bit (LSB)
      - bit[1]: Most Significant Bit (MSB)
  - data: 64-bit input (Data input for loading the shift register)
    - bit[63:0] indexing:
      - bit[0]: LSB
      - bit[63]: MSB
- Output Ports:
  - q: 64-bit output (Contents of the shift register)
    - bit[63:0] indexing:
      - bit[0]: LSB
      - bit[63]: MSB

Functionality:
- The module implements a 64-bit arithmetic shift register with synchronous load capabilities.
- The shift register supports shifting in both left and right directions and can shift by either 1 bit or 8 bits based on the "amount" input.

Signal Definitions:
1. load: When high, the shift register is loaded with data[63:0] instead of performing a shift operation.
2. ena: When high, the module performs the shift operation if not loading.
3. amount: Determines the shift direction and magnitude:
   - 2'b00: Shift left by 1 bit.
   - 2'b01: Shift left by 8 bits.
   - 2'b10: Shift right by 1 bit (arithmetic right shift).
   - 2'b11: Shift right by 8 bits (arithmetic right shift).
4. q: Outputs the current value of the shift register after the shift or load operation.

Sequential Logic:
- The shift register operates on the rising edge of clk.
- The load operation takes precedence over shifting. If load is high during the clock edge, the register loads data, ignoring the ena signal for that cycle.
- If load is low and ena is high, the shift operation is performed according to the amount input.

Reset Behavior:
- The shift register should be initialized to a known state (e.g., all bits zero) upon reset. Reset behavior is assumed to be synchronous and will reset the register state on the next clock cycle.

Initial Values:
- All flip-flops and registers should have an initial value of 64'b0.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the behavior of the shift register is defined for all possible values of the amount input, including transitions between shift directions and magnitudes.
- Special attention should be given to the arithmetic nature of right shifts to ensure that sign extension occurs correctly.

Dependencies and Race Conditions:
- Clearly define the precedence of operations: load > shift.
- Ensure that simultaneous changes to load and ena in the same clock cycle are handled correctly to avoid indeterminate states.

Mathematical Description:
- The output q[n] after a shift operation can be defined as follows:
  - For left shifts: q[n] = data[n - amount] for n = 0 to 62 (shift left)
  - For right shifts (arithmetic): 
    - q[63] = q[63] (sign bit remains unchanged)
    - q[n] = data[n + amount] for n = 0 to 61 (shift right)

Behavior at Input Boundaries:
- Clearly specify behavior when the load signal is asserted while ena is also asserted, and ensure that only one operation occurs at a time.
