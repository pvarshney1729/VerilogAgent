Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- **Input Ports**:
  - `input  clk;`                     // Clock signal, 1 bit, active on the rising edge
  - `input  load;`                    // Load signal, 1 bit, active high
  - `input  [511:0] data;`            // Input data, 512 bits, represents initial state of the cells

- **Output Ports**:
  - `output [511:0] q;`               // Output state of the cells, 512 bits

Cellular Automaton Specification:
- The module implements Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular automaton with 512 cells, indexed from `q[0]` (least significant bit) to `q[511]` (most significant bit). 
- Each cell's next state depends on its current state and the states of its immediate neighbors.
- The boundary conditions are defined as follows:
  - `q[-1]` and `q[512]` are treated as `0` (off).

State Transition Logic:
- The state transition for each cell `q[i]` (where `0 <= i <= 511`) is determined based on the following truth table:

| Left[i+1] | Center[i] | Right[i-1] | Center's next state |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
|     1     |     1     |      1      |          0          |
|     1     |     1     |      0      |          1          |
|     1     |     0     |      1      |          1          |
|     1     |     0     |      0      |          0          |
|     0     |     1     |      1      |          1          |
|     0     |     1     |      0      |          1          |
|     0     |     0     |      1      |          1          |
|     0     |     0     |      0      |          0          |

Operational Behavior:
- The output `q` is updated every clock cycle. 
- If `load` is high, the current state of `q` should be loaded with the values from `data[511:0]`.
- If `load` is low, the output will update according to the Rule 110 state transition logic based on the current state of `q`.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
- The state of the register `q` should be initialized to `0` (all cells off) on reset or when `load` is high.

Reset Behavior:
- A synchronous active high reset signal should be defined to initialize `q` to `0` if included in the final design.

Edge Case Behavior:
- The module should appropriately handle cases where `load` is asserted during normal operation, ensuring proper loading of new data without corruption of current state.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that state updates only occur after the completion of the previous state evaluation to prevent race conditions.

Please ensure all conditions are adhered to for successful implementation of the Rule 110 cellular automaton within the specified constraints.
