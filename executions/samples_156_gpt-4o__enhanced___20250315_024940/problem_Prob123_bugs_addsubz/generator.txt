Here is the corrected Verilog code for the adder-subtractor with a zero flag, ensuring to address the identified bug and adhere to the specified guidelines and coding conventions.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic do_sub,                // Control signal to select addition (0) or subtraction (1)
    input logic [7:0] a,               // First operand (8-bit unsigned)
    input logic [7:0] b,               // Second operand (8-bit unsigned)
    output logic [7:0] out,            // Output result (8-bit unsigned)
    output logic result_is_zero         // Zero flag (1-bit)
);

    always @(*) begin
        case (do_sub)
            1'b0: out = a + b;           // Perform addition
            1'b1: out = a - b;           // Perform subtraction
            default: out = 8'b00000000;  // Default case to prevent latches
        endcase

        result_is_zero = (out == 8'b00000000); // Set zero flag
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:

1. **Logic Declaration**:
   - All ports are declared as `logic` types, which is a recommended practice in SystemVerilog and ensures compatibility with various synthesis tools.

2. **Combinational Logic**:
   - The output `out` is computed in a single `always @(*)` block, ensuring that it reacts to any changes in the inputs (`do_sub`, `a`, or `b`).

3. **Handling Default Cases**:
   - A default case is included in the `case` statement to prevent unintended latches, although in practice, `out` is always assigned in both cases.

4. **Zero Flag Calculation**:
   - The `result_is_zero` flag is computed immediately after the calculation of `out`, ensuring that it reflects the correct state based on the latest result.

5. **Initialization**:
   - The output `out` and `result_is_zero` are not explicitly initialized in the module declaration but will be set in the always block.

This implementation fixes the bug by ensuring that the `result_is_zero` flag correctly reflects whether `out` is zero.
