When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Consider the following adder-subtractor with a zero flag:\n\n```verilog\nsynthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001\nmodule TopModule (\n    input wire do_sub,               // Control signal to select addition (0) or subtraction (1)\n    input wire [7:0] a,              // First operand (8-bit unsigned)\n    input wire [7:0] b,              // Second operand (8-bit unsigned)\n    output reg [7:0] out = 8'b00000000,  // Output result (8-bit unsigned), initialized to 0\n    output reg result_is_zero = 1'b0  // Zero flag (1-bit), initialized to 0\n);\n```\n\n1. **Functional Description**:\n   - The module performs either addition or subtraction on two 8-bit unsigned inputs `a` and `b`, based on the control signal `do_sub`.\n   - When `do_sub` is `0`, the module computes the sum of `a` and `b`.\n   - When `do_sub` is `1`, the module computes the difference `a - b`.\n\n2. **Combinational Logic**:\n   - The output `out` is updated in a combinational logic block based on the value of `do_sub`.\n   - The calculation for `out` and the evaluation of the zero flag `result_is_zero` must occur in the same always block to ensure the correct dependency and timing.\n\n3. **Zero Flag Calculation**:\n   - The zero flag `result_is_zero` is asserted high (`1`) if the output `out` is equal to `8'b00000000`.\n   - The assignment for `result_is_zero` must occur immediately after the calculation of `out`.\n\n4. **Reset Conditions**:\n   - There are no explicit reset signals defined. If a reset condition is required, it should be added to the specification.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The behavior of the module should be defined for all possible values of `a` and `b`, including edge cases where the result of subtraction may lead to negative values, which should be treated as unsigned wrapping.\n\n6. **Bit Indexing**:\n   - The bits of `a`, `b`, and `out` are indexed from `bit[7]` (most significant bit, MSB) to `bit[0]` (least significant bit, LSB).\n   - `out[0]` refers to the least significant bit of the output.\n\n7. **Race Conditions**:\n   - The sequential dependencies must be clearly defined to avoid race conditions. The output must be updated in a single always block to ensure that the calculations are always consistent.\n\n```verilog\nalways @(*) begin\n    case (do_sub)\n        1'b0: out = a + b;                     // Addition\n        1'b1: out = a - b;                     // Subtraction\n        default: out = 8'b00000000;            // Default case to avoid latches\n    endcase\n\n    result_is_zero = (out == 8'b00000000);     // Set zero flag if out is zero\nend\n```\n\n8. **Output Initialization**:\n   - The output `out` and the zero flag `result_is_zero` are initialized to `0` to ensure known states at module instantiation.\n\nendmodule\n```\n                    "
