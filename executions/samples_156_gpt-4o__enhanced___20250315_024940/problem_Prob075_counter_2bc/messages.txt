        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  areset\n - input  train_valid\n - input  train_taken\n - output state (2 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a two-bit saturating counter. The counter\nincrements (up to a maximum of 3) when train_valid = 1 and\ntrain_taken = 1. It decrements (down to a minimum of 0) when\ntrain_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0. When not training (train_valid = 0),\nthe counter keeps its value unchanged. areset is a positive edge\ntriggered asynchronous reset that resets the counter to weakly not-taken\n(2'b01). Output state[1:0] is the two-bit counter value. Assume all\nsequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input, clock signal (positive edge-triggered)\n  - areset: 1-bit input, asynchronous reset signal (active high)\n  - train_valid: 1-bit input, indicates if the training condition is valid (active high)\n  - train_taken: 1-bit input, indicates if the training action was taken (active high)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - state: 2-bit output, representing the current value of the saturating counter. \n    - bit[1]: Most Significant Bit (MSB)\n    - bit[0]: Least Significant Bit (LSB)\n\nCounter Functionality:\n- The module implements a 2-bit saturating counter with the following behavior:\n  - The counter value can range from 0 (00) to 3 (11).\n  - The counter increments by 1 when both train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 1, unless the counter is at its maximum value (3).\n  - The counter decrements by 1 when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0, unless the counter is at its minimum value (0).\n  - When train_valid = 0, the counter remains unchanged regardless of the value of train_taken.\n  \nReset Behavior:\n- The areset signal is an active high asynchronous reset that, when asserted, sets the counter to the state representing weakly not-taken, specifically 2'b01.\n  \nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential logic, including counter updates, is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The counter update occurs in accordance with the specified conditions in the clock cycle immediately following the positive edge of clk.\n\nInitial State:\n- Upon reset (assertion of areset), the counter is initialized to the value of 2'b01.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that input validation is performed to prevent invalid states. The counter must never exceed the defined maximum (3) or fall below the defined minimum (0).\n  \nSignal Dependencies:\n- Clearly define that the counter's increment and decrement operations depend on both the train_valid and train_taken signals, with precedence given to these conditions during each positive clock edge.\n                    "
