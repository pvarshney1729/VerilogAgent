Module Name: TopModule

Input/Output Interface:
- input clk: 1-bit clock signal (rising edge-triggered)
- input reset: 1-bit asynchronous reset signal (active high)
- input w: 1-bit input signal
- output z: 1-bit output signal

State Machine Specification:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states:
- State A (encoded as 2'b00)
- State B (encoded as 2'b01)
- State C (encoded as 2'b10)
- State D (encoded as 2'b11)
- State E (encoded as 2'b100)
- State F (encoded as 2'b101)

State Transition Table:
| Current State | Input w | Next State |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| A (00)       | 0       | B (01)     |
| A (00)       | 1       | A (00)     |
| B (01)       | 0       | C (10)     |
| B (01)       | 1       | D (11)     |
| C (10)       | 0       | E (100)    |
| C (10)       | 1       | D (11)     |
| D (11)       | 0       | F (101)    |
| D (11)       | 1       | A (00)     |
| E (100)      | 0       | E (100)    |
| E (100)      | 1       | D (11)     |
| F (101)      | 0       | C (10)     |
| F (101)      | 1       | D (11)     |

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is asynchronous and active high.
- Upon activation of the reset signal, the FSM transitions to State A (00).

Initial Conditions:
- All state registers should be initialized to State A (00) upon reset.
- The output z should be driven based on the current state as follows:
  - z = 1 when in state E (100)
  - z = 0 for all other states.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- All state transitions and output updates occur on the positive edge of the clk signal, contingent upon the reset not being asserted.

Edge Case Handling:
- Ensure that transitions from any state to State A (00) occur reliably when the reset is activated, regardless of the state or input signal w.
- Input w should be sampled on the rising edge of clk.

Signal Dependencies:
- The next state logic is dependent on both the current state and the value of the input signal w.
- Ensure that no race conditions occur in the state transition logic.
