        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - input  sel_b1\n - input  sel_b2\n - output out_assign\n - output out_always\n\nThe module should implement a 2-to-1 mux that chooses between a and b.\nChoose b if both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are true. Otherwise, choose a. Do the\nsame twice, once using assign statements and once using a procedural if\nstatement.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\nThe TopModule shall have the following input and output ports:\n\nInputs:\n- input wire a [1 bit]: First data input.\n- input wire b [1 bit]: Second data input.\n- input wire sel_b1 [1 bit]: Select signal for the second input.\n- input wire sel_b2 [1 bit]: Select signal for the second input.\n\nOutputs:\n- output wire out_assign [1 bit]: Output of the mux using continuous assignment.\n- output reg out_always [1 bit]: Output of the mux using procedural assignment.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux) that selects between the inputs 'a' and 'b' based on the values of the select signals 'sel_b1' and 'sel_b2'. \n\nSelection Logic:\n- The mux shall output 'b' if both 'sel_b1' and 'sel_b2' are high (true).\n- In all other cases, the mux shall output 'a'.\n\nImplementation:\n1. The output 'out_assign' shall be implemented using a continuous assignment statement.\n2. The output 'out_always' shall be implemented using a procedural block with an 'if' statement.\n\nReset Condition:\n- The module does not include any reset functionality, so all registers are initialized to an undefined state by default.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module must be tested to ensure correct behavior when both select signals are high, as well as when both are low, and any combinations in between.\n- Ensure that the outputs are stable and correctly reflect the selected input under all conditions, including rapid changes in select signals.\n\nTiming and Signal Dependencies:\n- There are no clocked elements in this module; thus, all outputs are combinational and dependent solely on the inputs and their respective select signals.\n\nAll signals are defined as unsigned 1-bit wide.\n                    "
