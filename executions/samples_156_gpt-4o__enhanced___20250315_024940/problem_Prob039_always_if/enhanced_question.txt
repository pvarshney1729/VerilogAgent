Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
The TopModule shall have the following input and output ports:

Inputs:
- input wire a [1 bit]: First data input.
- input wire b [1 bit]: Second data input.
- input wire sel_b1 [1 bit]: Select signal for the second input.
- input wire sel_b2 [1 bit]: Select signal for the second input.

Outputs:
- output wire out_assign [1 bit]: Output of the mux using continuous assignment.
- output reg out_always [1 bit]: Output of the mux using procedural assignment.

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux) that selects between the inputs 'a' and 'b' based on the values of the select signals 'sel_b1' and 'sel_b2'. 

Selection Logic:
- The mux shall output 'b' if both 'sel_b1' and 'sel_b2' are high (true).
- In all other cases, the mux shall output 'a'.

Implementation:
1. The output 'out_assign' shall be implemented using a continuous assignment statement.
2. The output 'out_always' shall be implemented using a procedural block with an 'if' statement.

Reset Condition:
- The module does not include any reset functionality, so all registers are initialized to an undefined state by default.

Edge Cases:
- The module must be tested to ensure correct behavior when both select signals are high, as well as when both are low, and any combinations in between.
- Ensure that the outputs are stable and correctly reflect the selected input under all conditions, including rapid changes in select signals.

Timing and Signal Dependencies:
- There are no clocked elements in this module; thus, all outputs are combinational and dependent solely on the inputs and their respective select signals.

All signals are defined as unsigned 1-bit wide.
