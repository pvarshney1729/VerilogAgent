        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  x\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine with the following\nbehavior. Input x goes to three different two-input gates: an XOR, an\nAND, and a OR gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of\na D flip-flop and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input\nNOR gate, whose output is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding\nflip-flop's output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding\nflip-flop's complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR\nis its corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.\n\nAssume that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the\nmachine begins. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive\nedge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

Each D flip-flop and gate has specific connections and logic behaviors as described below:\n\n1. **Combinational Logic:**\n   - The input signal `x` is fed into three different two-input gates:\n     - XOR Gate (XOR1): \n       - Inputs: `x` and FF1 output (denote as `FF1_out`)\n       - Output: `xor_out`\n     - AND Gate (AND1):\n       - Inputs: `x` and complemented FF2 output (denote as `~FF2_out`)\n       - Output: `and_out`\n     - OR Gate (OR1):\n       - Inputs: `x` and complemented FF3 output (denote as `~FF3_out`)\n       - Output: `or_out`\n\n2. **D Flip-Flops:**\n   - FF1: \n     - Input: `xor_out`\n     - Reset State: 1-bit output initialized to 0\n   - FF2: \n     - Input: `and_out`\n     - Reset State: 1-bit output initialized to 0\n   - FF3: \n     - Input: `or_out`\n     - Reset State: 1-bit output initialized to 0\n\n3. **Sequential Logic:**\n   - All D flip-flops are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - On the positive edge of `clk`, the outputs of the flip-flops (FF1_out, FF2_out, FF3_out) are updated with their respective inputs.\n\n4. **Final Output:**\n   - The outputs of the three D flip-flops (FF1_out, FF2_out, FF3_out) are fed into a three-input NOR gate (NOR1).\n   - The output `z` is defined as the result of the NOR gate:\n     - z = ~(FF1_out | FF2_out | FF3_out)\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is asynchronous.\n- Upon reset, all D flip-flops (FF1, FF2, FF3) are set to 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the behavior of the FSM is well-defined for all input combinations of `x`, including transitions between states when `x` changes.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output `z` is dependent on the states of the D flip-flops, which in turn depend on the outputs of the combinational logic gates influenced by the input `x`.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All signal widths are defined as 1-bit, with the least significant bit (LSB) being bit[0].\n                    "
