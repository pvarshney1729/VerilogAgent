Your FSM should\nhave an output signal, z, that is asserted to logic-1 when the \"101\"\nsequence is detected. Your FSM should also have a negative edge triggered\nasynchronous reset. You may only have 3 states in your state machine.\nYour FSM should recognize overlapping sequences. Assume all sequential\nlogic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, rising edge triggered)\n  - aresetn: 1-bit input (active low asynchronous reset)\n  - x: 1-bit input (input signal for sequence detection)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - z: 1-bit output (output signal asserted high when sequence \"101\" is detected)\n\nFunctional Specification:\n1. The module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes the bit sequence \"101\" on the input signal x.\n2. The output signal z shall be asserted to logic high (1) immediately upon detecting the \"101\" sequence, including overlapping occurrences.\n3. The FSM consists of exactly 3 states to track the detection of the sequence. The states are as follows:\n   - State 0 (S0): Initial state, waiting for '1'.\n   - State 1 (S1): Detected '1', waiting for '0'.\n   - State 2 (S2): Detected '10', waiting for '1' to complete the sequence.\n\n4. Asynchronous Reset:\n   - The aresetn input is an active low asynchronous reset. When aresetn is low (0), the FSM shall reset to State 0 (S0) regardless of the clock signal.\n   - Upon asserting aresetn, the output z shall be de-asserted (0).\n\n5. Sequential Logic:\n   - The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n   - The next state logic must be defined based on the current state and the value of x at the time of the clock edge.\n\n6. Initial Conditions:\n   - All state registers should be initialized to State 0 (S0) when the module is reset.\n\n7. Edge Cases:\n   - If x is continuously high or low, the FSM shall properly maintain its state until a transition occurs.\n   - The FSM must handle rapid changes in x without missing transitions or causing erroneous outputs.\n\n8. Signal Dependencies:\n   - The state transitions and output logic must be clearly defined to avoid race conditions based on the current state and the input x.\n\n9. State Transition Table:\n   - The state transition logic should be clearly documented in a state transition table that defines the next state and output for each combination of current state and input x.\n\n10. Output Behavior:\n    - The output z should be defined for all state transitions, ensuring that it reflects the correct detection of the sequence \"101\".\n                    "
