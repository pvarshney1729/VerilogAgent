All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a (5 bits)\n - input  b (5 bits)\n - input  c (5 bits)\n - input  d (5 bits)\n - input  e (5 bits)\n - input  f (5 bits)\n - output w (8 bits)\n - output x (8 bits)\n - output y (8 bits)\n - output z (8 bits)\n\nThe module should concatenate the input vectors together then split them\nup into several output vectors. There are six 5-bit input vectors: a, b,\nc, d, e, and f, for a total of 30 bits of input. There are four 8-bit\noutput vectors: w, x, y, and z, for 32 bits of output. The output should\nbe a concatenation of the input vectors followed by two 1 bits (the two 1\nbits should be in the LSB positions).\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- **Inputs**:\n  - `input [4:0] a;`  // 5 bits, least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0]\n  - `input [4:0] b;`  // 5 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n  - `input [4:0] c;`  // 5 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n  - `input [4:0] d;`  // 5 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n  - `input [4:0] e;`  // 5 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n  - `input [4:0] f;`  // 5 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n\n- **Outputs**:\n  - `output [7:0] w;`  // 8 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n  - `output [7:0] x;`  // 8 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n  - `output [7:0] y;`  // 8 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n  - `output [7:0] z;`  // 8 bits, LSB is bit[0]\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule shall concatenate the six 5-bit input vectors (a, b, c, d, e, f) into a single 30-bit vector. This 30-bit vector will be followed by two additional bits, both set to '1', making the total output length 32 bits. The output vectors (w, x, y, z) will be populated as follows:\n- `w` will receive the first 8 bits of the concatenated vector.\n- `x` will receive the next 8 bits.\n- `y` will receive the next 8 bits.\n- `z` will receive the final 8 bits of the concatenated vector including two extra bits '11' at the least significant positions.\n\nBehavior at Edge Cases:\n- The outputs (w, x, y, z) shall be valid and must reflect the correct concatenation of inputs even if any input vector is at its maximum ('11111') or minimum ('00000') values.\n- The module shall ensure that the output signals are stable during the concatenation process and that no race conditions occur.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All output signals (w, x, y, z) should be initialized to zero ('00000000') upon reset.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- The module will operate under a synchronous reset mechanism. Upon a reset signal, all outputs shall be set to zero ('00000000').\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output signals are directly dependent on the inputs a, b, c, d, e, and f. There are no intermediate signals between inputs and outputs, ensuring simple and clear signal dependencies.\n                    "
