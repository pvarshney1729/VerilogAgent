Here is the corrected version of the Verilog module that addresses the issues outlined in your original code. The main fix is to ensure that all output signals are correctly initialized and that the logic is clear. 

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    // Combinational logic to determine if the computer should be shut off
    always @(*) begin
        shut_off_computer = 1'b0; // Default to off
        if (cpu_overheated) begin
            shut_off_computer = 1'b1; // Set to 1 if CPU is overheated
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic to determine if we should keep driving
    always @(*) begin
        keep_driving = 1'b0; // Default to not driving
        if (~arrived) begin
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty; // Keep driving if gas tank is not empty
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Initialization of Outputs**: The outputs `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` are initialized to `1'b0` at the beginning of their respective always blocks to ensure they have a default state.
2. **Logic Clarity**: The logic is structured clearly to ensure that both outputs are set based on the conditions without retaining stale values. 

### Reasoning:
- The module is designed to control two outputs based on the internal states of the inputs.
- The design now adheres to good practices by initializing outputs and ensuring that the values are assigned in a clean, logical flow.
- This implementation will correctly reflect the conditions based on the input signals without unintended latching or stale output values. 

This modified code ensures that it follows the Verilog coding conventions and provides the expected functionality of the module.
