Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in; // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire [9:0] state; // 10-bit input signal representing current states (one-hot encoded)
  
- Output Ports:
  - output reg [9:0] next_state; // 10-bit output signal for next states (one-hot encoded)
  - output reg out1; // 1-bit output signal
  - output reg out2; // 1-bit output signal

State Encoding:
- The 10-bit input 'state[9:0]' uses one-hot encoding to represent states S0 through S9, where:
  - state[0] corresponds to S0
  - state[1] corresponds to S1
  - state[2] corresponds to S2
  - state[3] corresponds to S3
  - state[4] corresponds to S4
  - state[5] corresponds to S5
  - state[6] corresponds to S6
  - state[7] corresponds to S7
  - state[8] corresponds to S8
  - state[9] corresponds to S9

Output Logic:
- The outputs 'out1' and 'out2' are initialized to 0 unless specified otherwise during state transitions.
- The next state logic transitions based on the input 'in' and the current active states represented in 'state'.

State Transition Logic:
- The next_state[9:0] determines the subsequent state based on the current states in 'state[9:0]' and the input 'in' according to the following state transition table:

  | Current State | Input | Next State | out1 | out2 |
  |---------------|-------|------------|------|------|
  | S0            | 0     | S0         | 0    | 0    |
  | S0            | 1     | S1         | 0    | 0    |
  | S1            | 0     | S0         | 0    | 0    |
  | S1            | 1     | S2         | 0    | 0    |
  | S2            | 0     | S0         | 0    | 0    |
  | S2            | 1     | S3         | 0    | 0    |
  | S3            | 0     | S0         | 0    | 0    |
  | S3            | 1     | S4         | 0    | 0    |
  | S4            | 0     | S0         | 0    | 0    |
  | S4            | 1     | S5         | 0    | 0    |
  | S5            | 0     | S8         | 0    | 0    |
  | S5            | 1     | S6         | 0    | 0    |
  | S6            | 0     | S9         | 0    | 0    |
  | S6            | 1     | S7         | 0    | 0    |
  | S7            | 0     | S0         | 0    | 1    |
  | S7            | 1     | S7         | 0    | 1    |
  | S8            | 0     | S0         | 1    | 0    |
  | S8            | 1     | S1         | 1    | 0    |
  | S9            | 0     | S0         | 1    | 1    |
  | S9            | 1     | S1         | 1    | 1    |

Implementation Notes:
- The module does not include any flip-flops or registers for state storage; it only implements combinational logic for the next state and outputs.
- Ensure that the control logic properly handles state transitions based on the active states indicated in 'state[9:0]' and the input 'in'.
- Edge cases and input boundaries must be considered, ensuring that the state machine correctly responds to all possible combinations of the input signals.

Reset Conditions:
- The module does not include synchronous or asynchronous reset conditions. The behavior upon power-up or reset is not defined within this specification.
