        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in\n - input  state (10 bits)\n - output next_state (10 bits)\n - output out1\n - output out2\n\nGiven the follow state machine with 1 input and 2 outputs (the outputs\nare given as \"(out1, out2)\"):\n\n  S0 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S0 (0, 0) --1--> S1\n  S1 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S1 (0, 0) --1--> S2\n  S2 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S2 (0, 0) --1--> S3\n  S3 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S3 (0, 0) --1--> S4\n  S4 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S4 (0, 0) --1--> S5\n  S5 (0, 0) --0--> S8\n  S5 (0, 0) --1--> S6\n  S6 (0, 0) --0--> S9\n  S6 (0, 0) --1--> S7\n  S7 (0, 1) --0--> S0\n  S7 (0, 1) --1--> S7\n  S8 (1, 0) --0--> S0\n  S8 (1, 0) --1--> S1\n  S9 (1, 1) --0--> S0\n  S9 (1, 1) --1--> S1\n\nSuppose this state machine uses one-hot encoding, where state[0] through\nstate[9] correspond to the states S0 though S9, respectively. The outputs\nare zero unless otherwise specified. The next_state[0] through next_state[9] \ncorrespond to the transition to next states S0 though S9. For example, The \nnext_state[1] is set to 1 when the next state is S1 , otherwise, it is set to 0.\n\nHere, the input state[9:0] can be a combinational of multiple states, and \nthe TopModule is expected to response.\nFor example: \nWhen the state[9:0] = 10'b0000010100, state[4] == 1, and state[2] == 1, the \nstates includes S4, and S2 states.\n\nThe module should implement the state transition logic and output logic\nportions of the state machine (but not the state flip-flops). You are\ngiven the current state in state[9:0] and must implement next_state[9:0] \nand the two outputs.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"
