Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit [0:0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is bit[0])
  - b: bit [0:0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is bit[0])
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: bit [0:0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is bit[0])

Functionality:
- The module implements a combinational logic function, specifically a 2-input AND gate.
- The output 'out' shall be defined as follows:
  - out = a AND b

Behavior:
- The output 'out' shall be updated immediately in response to any changes on the inputs 'a' or 'b', without any clock cycles or delay. 
- There are no sequential elements or storage elements involved in this design.
  
Edge Cases:
- The inputs 'a' and 'b' can either be 0 or 1. The output 'out' will reflect the logical AND of both inputs:
  - If a = 0 and b = 0, then out = 0
  - If a = 0 and b = 1, then out = 0
  - If a = 1 and b = 0, then out = 0
  - If a = 1 and b = 1, then out = 1
