Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - A: bit[1:0] (2 bits, unsigned)
    - bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB)
    - bit[1] refers to the most significant bit (MSB)
  - B: bit[1:0] (2 bits, unsigned)
    - bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB)
    - bit[1] refers to the most significant bit (MSB)

- Output Port:
  - z: bit (1 bit, unsigned)

Functional Specification:
The module shall implement a combinational logic circuit that compares two 2-bit unsigned inputs, A and B. The output z shall be determined as follows:
- If A == B, then z = 1 (true)
- If A â‰  B, then z = 0 (false)

Behavior:
- The comparison shall consider all possible values of A and B (from 0 (00) to 3 (11)).
- The output z shall be updated immediately based on the values of A and B without any delay, as this is a pure combinational circuit.
- No clock or reset signal is defined since the module does not implement sequential logic.

Edge Cases:
- The module shall handle all possible combinations of A and B, including the cases where both inputs are at their minimum (00) and maximum (11) values.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z depends directly on the values of inputs A and B with no additional intermediate signals.
- There are no potential race conditions as the circuit is entirely combinational.

Initial Values:
- Since this is a combinational circuit, there are no registers or flip-flops, and thus no initial values are required.
