Based on the specifications provided, I will implement the `TopModule` in Verilog. The module will take two inputs, `in1` and `in2`, apply a NOT operation to `in2`, and then pass the result along with `in1` to an AND gate. The output of the AND gate will be assigned to the output port `out`.

Here is the Verilog code:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has three ports definedâ€”two inputs (`in1` and `in2`) and one output (`out`).
2. **Logic Type**: All ports are declared as `logic`, adhering to the coding conventions.
3. **Combinational Logic**: The output `out` is calculated using an `assign` statement, which is appropriate for combinational logic. The expression `in1 & ~in2` implements the desired logic operation where `in2` is inverted (NOT operation).
4. **No Sequential Logic**: Since this is a purely combinational module, there are no clock or reset signals involved, and thus no need for sequential elements or sensitivity lists. 

This implementation accurately reflects the requirements specified in your question.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
