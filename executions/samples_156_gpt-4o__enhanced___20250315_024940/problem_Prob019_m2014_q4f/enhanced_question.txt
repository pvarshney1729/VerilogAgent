Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in1 : 1-bit input (unsigned) 
  - input wire in2 : 1-bit input (unsigned)
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out : 1-bit output (unsigned)

Description:
The TopModule implements a digital logic circuit where two 1-bit inputs, in1 and in2, are processed through a logic gate. The circuit functionality is defined as follows:

1. The AND gate receives in1 and the inverted version of in2 (denoted as NOT in2).
2. The output of the AND gate is assigned to the output port 'out'.

Logic Operation:
- The relationship can be expressed in Boolean algebra as:
  out = in1 AND (NOT in2)
  
- Truth Table:
  | in1 | in2 | out |
  |-----|-----|-----|
  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
  |  1  |  1  |  0  |

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is solely dependent on the current values of 'in1' and 'in2' with the inversion applied to 'in2'.
- There are no flip-flops or sequential elements; thus, no clock cycle relationships or reset conditions are applicable.

Edge Cases:
- The module handles all input combinations of in1 and in2, providing a defined output for each potential state based on the truth table above.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions since the module is purely combinational logic.

Initial Values:
- Not applicable as there are no sequential elements in this design.

Precedence of Operations:
- The NOT operation on 'in2' is performed before the AND operation with 'in1'.

Race Conditions:
- There are no race conditions present due to the combinational nature of the design.
