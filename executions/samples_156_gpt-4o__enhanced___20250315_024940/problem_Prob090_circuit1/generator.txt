Generated Response:

Based on the provided specifications and the analysis of the truth table derived from the simulation waveforms, here is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog.

This module implements a combinational circuit that outputs `q` based on the inputs `a` and `b` according to the logic derived from the truth table. 

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic to determine output q based on inputs a and b
    assign q = a & b;  // q is high only when both a and b are high

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has two input ports (`a` and `b`) and one output port (`q`), all defined as `logic`.

2. **Combinational Logic**: The output `q` is defined using an assign statement. The expression `a & b` implements the logic that `q` should be high only when both inputs `a` and `b` are high, which matches the truth table derived from the waveform data.

3. **No Sequential Logic**: Since the behavior is purely combinational, there is no need for sequential elements like flip-flops or clock signals, and hence no synchronous reset is implemented.

This code follows the guidelines and conventions you provided while ensuring correct Verilog syntax.
