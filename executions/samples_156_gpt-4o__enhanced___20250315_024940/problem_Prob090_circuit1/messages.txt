When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input, unsigned, LSB at bit[0]\n  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input, unsigned, LSB at bit[0]\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output logic q;  // 1-bit output, unsigned, LSB at bit[0]\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic circuit that produces the output signal q based on the input signals a and b. The output q is determined by the following truth table derived from the provided simulation waveforms:\n\n| a | b | q |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\n- The output q is high (1) only when both a and b are high (1). In all other cases, the output q is low (0).\n\nSimulation Waveform Timing:\n- The module should reflect the following behavior at specified time intervals:\n  - At time 0ns to 20ns: a = 0, b = 0, q = 0\n  - At time 25ns to 30ns: a = 0, b = 1, q = 0\n  - At time 35ns to 40ns: a = 1, b = 0, q = 0\n  - At time 45ns to 50ns: a = 1, b = 1, q = 1\n  - At time 55ns to 70ns: a = 0, b = 0, q = 0\n  - At time 75ns to 80ns: a = 1, b = 0, q = 0\n  - At time 85ns to 90ns: a = 1, b = 1, q = 1\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure to handle transitions when a or b changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, resulting in the appropriate change in q based on the truth table.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The module does not utilize any sequential logic elements, hence no need for clock or reset definitions.\n- All operations should be purely combinational based on the current values of inputs a and b, with no need for memory states.\n                    "
