Module Specification for TopModule:

Module Name: TopModule

Input/Output Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in: 1-bit input signal
  - input wire [3:0] state: 4-bit input signal representing the current state (one-hot encoded)
- Output Ports:
  - output wire [3:0] next_state: 4-bit output signal representing the next state (one-hot encoded)
  - output wire out: 1-bit output signal

State Encoding:
- One-hot state encoding is defined as follows:
  - State A: 4'b0001
  - State B: 4'b0010
  - State C: 4'b0100
  - State D: 4'b1000

State Transition Logic:
- The module implements the combinational logic of a Moore state machine based on the following state transition table:

| Current State | Input (in) | Next State | Output (out) |
|---------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| A (4'b0001)   | 0          | A (4'b0001) | 0            |
| A (4'b0001)   | 1          | B (4'b0010) | 0            |
| B (4'b0010)   | 0          | C (4'b0100) | 0            |
| B (4'b0010)   | 1          | B (4'b0010) | 0            |
| C (4'b0100)   | 0          | A (4'b0001) | 0            |
| C (4'b0100)   | 1          | D (4'b1000) | 0            |
| D (4'b1000)   | 0          | C (4'b0100) | 1            |
| D (4'b1000)   | 1          | B (4'b0010) | 1            |

Behavioral Description:
- The output (out) is determined solely by the current state of the machine and not by the input (in).
- The next state (next_state) is derived from the current state and the value of the input (in).

Implementation Requirements:
- Clearly separate combinational logic from any potential sequential logic.
- Ensure that there is no race condition in the combinational logic.
- The module does not include any storage elements or sequential elements; hence, no reset conditions are defined.

Edge Case Handling:
- The module should handle transitions appropriately for each defined state and input combination as outlined in the state transition table.

Initial Values:
- As this module is purely combinational, there are no flip-flops or registers that require initial values or reset states.
