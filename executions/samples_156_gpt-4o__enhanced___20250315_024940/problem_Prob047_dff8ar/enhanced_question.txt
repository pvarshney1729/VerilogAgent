Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock. The most significant bit (MSB) is bit[0].
  - areset: 1-bit input signal for active high asynchronous reset. The MSB is bit[0].
  - d: 8-bit input data signal (d[7:0]), where d[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and d[7] is the MSB.

- Output Ports:
  - q: 8-bit output signal (q[7:0]), where q[0] is the LSB and q[7] is the MSB.

Functional Description:
- The module will contain 8 D flip-flops (DFFs) with the following characteristics:
  - Triggering: Each DFF will be triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
  - Reset: Each DFF will have an active high asynchronous reset, meaning that when areset is high, each DFF will reset its output to 0 regardless of the clk signal.

Sequential Logic Details:
- The reset state of all DFF outputs (q[7:0]) will be initialized to 0 when areset is high.
- The output q will reflect the input d after the positive edge of clk when areset is low.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure that the module behaves correctly when:
  - areset is asserted while clk is stable.
  - clk transitions while areset is asserted.
  - d changes while areset is asserted.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q[7:0] depends on the input d[7:0] and the clk signal, with precedence given to areset during its active state.

Race Conditions:
- Ensure that the design avoids race conditions by maintaining clear timing relationships between areset, clk, and d inputs.

Initial Values:
- All DFF outputs (q[7:0]) should be explicitly defined to reset to 0 upon an active high areset signal.
