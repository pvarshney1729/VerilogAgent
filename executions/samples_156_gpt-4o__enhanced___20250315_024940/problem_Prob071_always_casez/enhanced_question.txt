Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 8 bits
  - Sign: Unsigned
  - Description: An 8-bit vector where each bit represents a binary value (0 or 1).

- Output Port:
  - Name: pos
  - Width: 3 bits
  - Sign: Unsigned
  - Description: A 3-bit output representing the index of the first (least significant) bit that is high (1) in the input vector. If no bits are high, the output should be 3'b000.

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a combinational logic priority encoder for an 8-bit input vector.
- The output, pos, should indicate the index of the least significant bit (LSB) that is set to 1 (high) in the input vector, in the following manner:
  - bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) of the input vector.
  - If the input vector has no bits that are high, then pos should output 3'b000.
  
Operational Details:
- For an input vector of 'in' with the binary representation of 8'b10010000, the expected output will be pos = 3'd4, as bit[4] is the first bit that is high.

Edge Case Handling:
- If all bits in the input vector 'in' are 0 (e.g., 8'b00000000), the output pos must be explicitly set to 3'b000.

Implementation Considerations:
- Ensure there are no race conditions in determining the output based on the input.
- The module should handle all possible values of the input vector, including cases where multiple bits are set to high.
