Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. 
  - resetn: 1-bit input representing the active-low synchronous reset signal.
  - byteena: 2-bit input for byte enables, where:
    - byteena[1]: controls write access to the upper byte (d[15:8])
    - byteena[0]: controls write access to the lower byte (d[7:0])
  - d: 16-bit input data bus, where d[15] is the most significant bit (MSB) and d[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - q: 16-bit output data bus, where q[15] corresponds to the MSB and q[0] corresponds to the LSB. 

Functional Description:
- The module contains 16 D flip-flops (DFFs), denoted as DFF[0] to DFF[15]. Each DFF is responsible for storing one bit of the output q.
- The byteena inputs determine which of the two 8-bit segments of the data bus d will be written to the DFFs during a clock cycle.
  - If byteena[0] is asserted (logic high), the lower byte (d[7:0]) will be written to DFF[0] through DFF[7].
  - If byteena[1] is asserted (logic high), the upper byte (d[15:8]) will be written to DFF[8] through DFF[15].
  - If both byteena inputs are deasserted (logic low), no writing to the DFFs occurs during that clock cycle.

Reset Behavior:
- The resetn signal is a synchronous, active-low reset. When resetn is deasserted (logic low), all DFFs are set to 0 on the next positive edge of clk.
- When resetn is asserted (logic high), the DFFs retain their previous values.

Clocking:
- All DFFs are triggered on the positive edge of clk.

Edge Cases:
- If both byteena[0] and byteena[1] are asserted simultaneously, the behavior is defined as follows: the lower byte (d[7:0]) takes precedence over the upper byte (d[15:8]) in writing to the DFFs.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is updated with the values stored in the DFFs on the next positive edge of clk after the byteena signals are evaluated.

Initialization:
- All DFFs are initialized to 0 upon activation of the reset signal (when resetn is asserted low).
