All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a ( 3 bits)\n - output q (16 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation\nwaveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.\n\n  time  a     q\n  0ns   x     x\n  5ns   x     x\n  10ns  x     x\n  15ns  0  1232\n  20ns  1  aee0\n  25ns  2  27d4\n  30ns  3  5a0e\n  35ns  4  2066\n  40ns  5  64ce\n  45ns  6  c526\n  50ns  7  2f19\n  55ns  0  1232\n  60ns  1  aee0\n  65ns  2  27d4\n  70ns  4  2066\n  75ns  1  aee0\n  80ns  1  aee0\n  85ns  3  5a0e\n  90ns  5  64ce\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port:\n  - Name: a\n  - Width: 3 bits\n  - Description: a[2:0] where a[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and a[2] is the most significant bit (MSB). The input 'a' represents a 3-bit unsigned integer.\n\n- Output Port:\n  - Name: q\n  - Width: 16 bits\n  - Description: q[15:0] where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[15] is the most significant bit (MSB). The output 'q' represents a 16-bit hexadecimal value.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module implements a combinational logic circuit that produces the output 'q' based on the input 'a'. \n- The relationship between the input 'a' and the output 'q' is determined by the provided simulation waveforms. \n\nSimulation Waveform Behavior:\n- The output 'q' is expected to change based on specific values of 'a' at defined time intervals. The values observed in the simulation are as follows:\n\n  | Time (ns) | Input a (3 bits) | Output q (16 bits) |\n  |-----------|-------------------|---------------------|\n  | 0         | x                 | x                   |\n  | 5         | x                 | x                   |\n  | 10        | x                 | x                   |\n  | 15        | 000               | 1232                |\n  | 20        | 001               | aee0                |\n  | 25        | 010               | 27d4                |\n  | 30        | 011               | 5a0e                |\n  | 35        | 100               | 2066                |\n  | 40        | 101               | 64ce                |\n  | 45        | 110               | c526                |\n  | 50        | 111               | 2f19                |\n  | 55        | 000               | 1232                |\n  | 60        | 001               | aee0                |\n  | 65        | 010               | 27d4                |\n  | 70        | 100               | 2066                |\n  | 75        | 001               | aee0                |\n  | 80        | 001               | aee0                |\n  | 85        | 011               | 5a0e                |\n  | 90        | 101               | 64ce                |\n\n- The output 'q' must reflect the correct values corresponding to the input 'a' as specified in the table above. \n\nEdge Cases:\n- The output 'q' should be defined for all possible values of 'a' (000 to 111). Any undefined states must be clearly handled, ensuring that the module does not produce invalid outputs.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Ensure that inputs are valid and do not lead to any race conditions or undefined behavior during the simulation.\n                    "
