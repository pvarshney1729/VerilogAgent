All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  d   (8 bits)\n - output q   (8 bits)\n\nThe module should include 8 D flip-flops. All DFFs should be triggered by\nthe positive edge of clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    **Module Name:** TopModule\n\n**Interface:**\n- **Input Ports:**\n  - `input clk;`  // Clock signal, single bit (1-bit wide)\n  - `input [7:0] d;`  // Data input, 8 bits wide (bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB), bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB))\n\n- **Output Ports:**\n  - `output reg [7:0] q;`  // Data output, 8 bits wide, registered output \n\n**Functional Description:**\n- The module implements a total of 8 D flip-flops (DFFs).\n- Each DFF is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n  \n**Sequential Logic:**\n- Each DFF should hold its respective input from `d` on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n**Reset Behavior:**\n- A synchronous reset signal is not explicitly mentioned. If a reset functionality is required, please specify the reset signal and its behavior.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- The output register `q` should be initialized to `8'b00000000` upon module instantiation.\n\n**Signal Dependencies:**\n- The output `q` is dependent on the input `d` at the rising edge of `clk`.\n- No combinational logic is specified; all operations are sequential based on the clock cycle.\n\n**Edge Case Behavior:**\n- The behavior of `q` at the initial clock cycles before the first positive edge of `clk` is defined by its initialization state.\n\n**Potential Race Conditions:**\n- Ensure that all flip-flops are driven solely by the positive edge of `clk` to avoid race conditions.\n                    "
