**Module Name:** TopModule

**Interface:**
- **Input Ports:**
  - `input clk;`  // Clock signal, single bit (1-bit wide)
  - `input [7:0] d;`  // Data input, 8 bits wide (bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB), bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB))

- **Output Ports:**
  - `output reg [7:0] q;`  // Data output, 8 bits wide, registered output 

**Functional Description:**
- The module implements a total of 8 D flip-flops (DFFs).
- Each DFF is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
  
**Sequential Logic:**
- Each DFF should hold its respective input from `d` on the rising edge of `clk`.

**Reset Behavior:**
- A synchronous reset signal is not explicitly mentioned. If a reset functionality is required, please specify the reset signal and its behavior.

**Initial State:**
- The output register `q` should be initialized to `8'b00000000` upon module instantiation.

**Signal Dependencies:**
- The output `q` is dependent on the input `d` at the rising edge of `clk`.
- No combinational logic is specified; all operations are sequential based on the clock cycle.

**Edge Case Behavior:**
- The behavior of `q` at the initial clock cycles before the first positive edge of `clk` is defined by its initialization state.

**Potential Race Conditions:**
- Ensure that all flip-flops are driven solely by the positive edge of `clk` to avoid race conditions.
