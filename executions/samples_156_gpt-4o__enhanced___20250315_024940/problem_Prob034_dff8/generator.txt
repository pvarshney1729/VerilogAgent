Here is the implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] d,
    output logic [7:0] q
);

    // On the positive edge of the clock, update the output q with the input d
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

    // Initialize q to zero
    initial begin
        q = 8'b00000000;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` as specified, with the necessary input and output ports declared.

2. **Port Types**: All ports are declared as `logic`, adhering to the coding conventions provided.

3. **Sequential Logic**: An `always` block is used to implement the D flip-flop behavior, triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`. This block assigns the value of `d` to `q`.

4. **Initialization**: A separate `initial` block is included to set `q` to `8'b00000000`, ensuring that all flip-flops start with a known state when the module is first simulated.

5. **Clarity and Readability**: The code is structured to be clear and easily readable while maintaining adherence to all specified guidelines and conventions. 

This Verilog code satisfies all requirements and should function as intended in a simulation or synthesis environment.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] d,
    output logic [7:0] q
);

    // On the positive edge of the clock, update the output q with the input d
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

    // Initialize q to zero
    initial begin
        q = 8'b00000000;
    end

endmodule
