### Explanation of the Implementation:
1. **State Enumeration**: We defined the states of the state machine using an enumerated type `state_t`, which includes states for IDLE, WAIT_PATTERN, READ_DELAY, COUNTING, and DONE.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: The state machine and all registers are reset synchronously with the clock. This ensures all states and counters are initialized appropriately.

3. **State Logic**: 
   - In IDLE, the module waits for the first bit of the pattern (1).
   - In WAIT_PATTERN, it checks if the bits match the sequence 1101.
   - In READ_DELAY, it collects the next four bits to form the delay value.
   - In COUNTING, it counts down based on the `delay` and updates the `count` output.
   - In DONE, it waits for the acknowledgment signal (`ack`) to reset and start searching again.

4. **Counter Logic**: A 20-bit counter is used to count clock cycles, ensuring it can accommodate the maximum count required. The `count` output reflects the remaining time, and is set to a don't-care value when not counting.

5. **Output Logic**: The `count` output is assigned based on whether the timer is counting or not.

This design adheres to the specified guidelines and coding conventions, ensuring correct functionality per the requirements given.
