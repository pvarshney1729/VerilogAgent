All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  x3\n - input  x2\n - input  x1\n - output f\n\nThe module should implement a combinational circuit for the following\ntruth table:\n\n  x3 | x2 | x1 | f\n  0  | 0  | 0  | 0\n  0  | 0  | 1  | 0\n  0  | 1  | 0  | 1\n  0  | 1  | 1  | 1\n  1  | 0  | 0  | 0\n  1  | 0  | 1  | 1\n  1  | 1  | 0  | 0\n  1  | 1  | 1  | 1\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

The logical relationships between these inputs must be derived to achieve the desired output values as specified in the truth table.\n\nBehavior at Edge Cases:\n- The circuit must be capable of handling all possible combinations of the three input bits (x3, x2, x1) in accordance with the truth table provided, covering the full range of binary values from 000 to 111.\n\nInitial Values:\n- As this is a combinational circuit, there are no registers or flip-flops to initialize. The output f should be computed directly based on the current input values.\n\nImplementation considerations:\n- Ensure that the implementation avoids any race conditions by clearly defining the logic gates or expressions used to derive the output from the inputs without any ambiguous dependencies.\n                    "
