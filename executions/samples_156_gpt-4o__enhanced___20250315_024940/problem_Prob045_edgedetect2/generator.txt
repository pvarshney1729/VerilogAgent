Based on the provided specifications and guidelines, here is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog. The module detects any edge in the 8-bit input vector and sets the corresponding output bits in the `anyedge` signal.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] anyedge
);

    // Internal signal to hold the previous state of 'in'
    logic [7:0] prev_in;

    // Sequential logic to detect edges on the rising clock edge
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Update 'anyedge' based on the transition from 'prev_in' to 'in'
        anyedge <= (in ^ prev_in) & (prev_in != in);
        // Update 'prev_in' to the current 'in' for the next clock cycle
        prev_in <= in;
    end

    // Initialize 'prev_in' to zero at the start of simulation
    initial begin
        prev_in = 8'b0;
        anyedge = 8'b0; // Initialize anyedge to zero
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule`, and it has the specified input and output ports.
2. **Internal Signal Declaration**: An internal signal `prev_in` is declared to hold the previous state of the input vector `in`.
3. **Sequential Logic**: An `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. Inside this block:
   - The `anyedge` output is updated by calculating the bitwise XOR (`^`) between the current input `in` and the previous input `prev_in`. This operation identifies which bits have changed.
   - The result is ANDed with a condition that checks if `prev_in` is not equal to `in` to ensure that the output is set correctly only when there is an actual change (transition).
   - Finally, `prev_in` is updated to hold the current state of `in` for the subsequent clock cycle.
4. **Initialization**: An `initial` block initializes `prev_in` and `anyedge` to zero at the start of simulation to ensure a defined state.

The implementation adheres to the specified guidelines, ensuring clarity and correctness in detecting edges for each bit in the input vector.
