Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[3:0] (4 bits) - Represents a 4-bit input where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - out_and: bit (1 bit) - Represents the output of a 4-input AND gate.
  - out_or: bit (1 bit) - Represents the output of a 4-input OR gate.
  - out_xor: bit (1 bit) - Represents the output of a 4-input XOR gate.

Functionality:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit with the following behavior:
1. out_and: This output will be high (1) if all four bits of the input 'in' are high (1). 
   - Mathematical description: out_and = in[0] AND in[1] AND in[2] AND in[3]

2. out_or: This output will be high (1) if at least one bit of the input 'in' is high (1). 
   - Mathematical description: out_or = in[0] OR in[1] OR in[2] OR in[3]

3. out_xor: This output will be high (1) if the number of high (1) bits in the input 'in' is odd. 
   - Mathematical description: out_xor = in[0] XOR in[1] XOR in[2] XOR in[3]

Dependencies:
- The outputs out_and, out_or, and out_xor are all dependent on the four input bits of the 'in' signal and are updated based on the logic operations defined above.

Edge Cases:
- When all input bits are 0 (in = 4'b0000):
  - out_and = 0
  - out_or = 0
  - out_xor = 0
- When all input bits are 1 (in = 4'b1111):
  - out_and = 1
  - out_or = 1
  - out_xor = 0
- For any input pattern with an odd number of 1s (e.g., in = 4'b1010):
  - out_xor = 1
- For any input pattern with an even number of 1s (e.g., in = 4'b1100):
  - out_xor = 0

Note: Ensure that the module does not have any race conditions and that all outputs are computed concurrently based on the input signal.
