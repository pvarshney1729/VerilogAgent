All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nImplement the following Moore state machine with two states, one input,\nand one output. The reset state is B and reset is active-high\nsynchronous.\n\n  B (out=1) --in=0--> A\n  B (out=1) --in=1--> B\n  A (out=0) --in=0--> B\n  A (out=0) --in=1--> A\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"
