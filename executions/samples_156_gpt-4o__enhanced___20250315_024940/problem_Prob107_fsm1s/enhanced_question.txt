Module Name: TopModule

Input/Output Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: bit (1) - clock signal (active rising edge)
  - reset: bit (1) - synchronous reset signal (active high)
  - in: bit (1) - input signal
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: bit (1) - output signal

State Machine Specification:
- Type: Moore state machine
- Number of States: 2 (States A and B)
- Input: 1 bit (in)
- Output: 1 bit (out)

State Definitions:
- State B: 
  - Output (out): 1
  - Transitions:
    - From B to A when in = 0
    - From B to B when in = 1
- State A:
  - Output (out): 0
  - Transitions:
    - From A to B when in = 0
    - From A to A when in = 1

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and active high.
- Upon reset, the state machine initializes to state B, with out set to 1.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of clk, contingent upon the state of the reset signal and the input signal (in).

Initial Values:
- All flip-flops and registers must be explicitly initialized to the reset state upon activation of the reset signal.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The state machine must handle all valid combinations of the input signal (in), which may include stable states and transitions at the clock edges.

Signal Dependencies and Race Conditions:
- Ensure that the output signal (out) is dependent solely on the current state of the state machine and does not introduce race conditions during transitions.

Formal Definitions:
- State Transition Table:
  | Current State | Input (in) | Next State | Output (out) |
  |---------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
  | B             | 0          | A           | 1             |
  | B             | 1          | B           | 1             |
  | A             | 0          | B           | 0             |
  | A             | 1          | A           | 0             |

- The state diagram will visually represent these transitions with state labels corresponding to the defined outputs.
