### Reasoning:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with input ports (`clk` and `a`) and output port `q` which is 3 bits wide.
2. **Initial State**: The output `q` is initialized to `3'b000` at the start of the simulation.
3. **Sequential Logic**: An `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to define the behavior of the output `q` based on the current state and the input `a`.
4. **State Transitions**: The transitions are designed to match the behavior detailed in the provided simulation waveforms, ensuring that the output `q` reflects the correct value based on `a` and previous outputs. The use of a `case` statement simplifies the logic for specific states.
5. **Increment Logic**: If `a` is high, `q` is incremented; otherwise, the value is held. This accommodates the behavior needed for the simulation output.
6. **Edge Cases**: The implementation explicitly handles all transitions including the default case to ensure that `q` does not exceed its maximum value and behaves correctly during input transitions.

This implementation effectively captures the specified functionality of the sequential circuit as per the provided simulation waveforms.
