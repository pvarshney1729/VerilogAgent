When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1 bit (clock signal, active on rising edge)\n  - a: 1 bit (data input)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 3 bits (output data, bit[2] is the most significant bit (MSB), bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB))\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule implements a sequential circuit. The behavior of this circuit is defined in terms of the input signals and is determined by the clock cycles. The output q is updated based on the input signal a and the clock signal clk.\n\nClocking:\n- The circuit is synchronous and operates on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module does not specify a reset signal. Therefore, the initial state of the output q is undefined until the first clock cycle. It is recommended to define an initial state for q, for example, q = 3'b000 at time 0ns.\n\nState Transition and Output Behavior:\n- The output q is updated based on the following waveform behavior:\n  - At time 0ns, when clk = 0 and a = 1, output q is undefined (x).\n  - At time 5ns, when clk transitions to 1 (rising edge), if a = 1, output q changes to 3'b100 (value 4).\n  - If clk remains high (1) and a = 1, the output q remains at 3'b100.\n  - At time 45ns, when a transitions to 0, output q remains at 3'b100 until the next rising edge.\n  - At times when a transitions between 0 and 1 during the clock cycles, the corresponding updates to q will follow the observed behavior in the provided waveform table.\n  \nEdge Cases:\n- If a transitions to 0 at any point, the output q may increment based on the previous value of q, depending on the specific timing of a with respect to clk.\n- The output should not exceed the maximum value representable by 3 bits (3'b111 or decimal 7).\n\nInitial Values:\n- It is recommended to explicitly state that q will be initialized to 3'b000 at the start of the simulation.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is dependent on both the current state of a and the previous state of q during the clock cycles. \n\nRace Conditions:\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions by clearly defining the precedence of operations between a and the clk edge.\n\nOutput States:\n- The output q must be defined for all possible combinations of clk and a, especially during transitions to ensure predictable behavior.\n\nThe implementation must faithfully represent the timing and values illustrated in the simulation waveform provided.\n                    "
