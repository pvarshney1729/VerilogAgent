Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. 
  - load: 1-bit input for loading initial data into the system.
  - data: 512-bit input representing the initial state of the cellular automaton (data[511:0]).

- Output Ports:
  - q: 512-bit output representing the current state of the cellular automaton (q[511:0]).

Specifications:
1. The module implements Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton.
2. The state of each cell in the array is determined by the XOR of its two immediate neighbors.
3. The cell array is indexed as follows:
   - q[0] is the least significant cell (LSB).
   - q[511] is the most significant cell (MSB).
   - For boundary conditions, assume q[-1] and q[512] are both zero (off) for all calculations.

4. The module operates as follows:
   - On the rising edge of clk:
     - If load is high (1), initialize the state of the cellular automaton with data[511:0] (i.e., set q <= data).
     - If load is low (0), compute the next state of q based on the current values of q using the following rule:
       - For each cell q[i] (where 1 ≤ i ≤ 510):
         - q[i] = (q[i-1] XOR q[i+1]), with the following initial conditions:
           - q[0] = (0 XOR q[1])
           - q[511] = (q[510] XOR 0)

5. Reset Conditions:
   - The module does not specify a reset signal; consider implementing an asynchronous active-low reset signal if needed for initialization.

6. Sequential Logic:
   - All state updates occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.
   - Ensure all registers (including the q register) are initialized to a defined state when loaded.

7. Edge Cases:
   - If the load signal is asserted (high) while clk is high, the data should be loaded without affecting the current state of q until the next clock cycle.
   - Ensure proper handling of the boundaries where q[-1] and q[512] are considered zero.

8. Signal Dependencies:
   - Ensure that the computation of the next state for each cell does not introduce race conditions due to concurrent updates.

9. Operational Characteristics:
   - The module should exhibit stable behavior for all possible input combinations within the defined boundaries.
