Here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements Rule 90 as specified:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic load,
    input  logic [511:0] data,
    output logic [511:0] q
);

    logic [511:0] next_q;

    always @(*) begin
        next_q[0] = 1'b0 ^ q[1]; // q[-1] is assumed to be 0
        for (int i = 1; i < 511; i++) begin
            next_q[i] = q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
        end
        next_q[511] = q[510] ^ 1'b0; // q[512] is assumed to be 0
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data; // Load data into q
        end else begin
            q <= next_q; // Update q with the next state
        end
    end

    // Initialize q to zero at the beginning of simulation
    initial begin
        q = 512'b0;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and includes input and output ports as specified.

2. **Signal Declaration**: 
   - `next_q` is declared to hold the next state of the cellular automaton before it is assigned to `q`.

3. **Combinational Logic**:
   - The `always @(*)` block computes the `next_q` based on the current state of `q`. 
   - The leftmost cell (`next_q[0]`) considers `q[-1]` as 0, and the rightmost cell (`next_q[511]`) considers `q[512]` as 0.
   - A loop iterates through the cells from `1` to `510` to calculate the next state using the XOR of the left and right neighbors.

4. **Sequential Logic**:
   - The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the state of `q` on the rising edge of the clock.
   - If `load` is high, `q` is loaded with the provided `data`. Otherwise, `q` is updated with `next_q`.

5. **Initialization**: The initial block sets `q` to zero at the beginning of the simulation, ensuring a defined starting state.

This implementation adheres strictly to the provided specifications and coding conventions, ensuring correctness in the design of the Rule 90 cellular automaton.
