Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is a[0])
  - b: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is b[0])
  - c: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is c[0])
  - d: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is d[0])
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned, LSB is q[0])

Behavior:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The output q is determined based on the values of the inputs a, b, c, and d as specified in the provided truth table below.

Truth Table:
| Time (ns) | a | b | c | d | q |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 10        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 15        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 20        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 25        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 30        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 35        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 40        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 45        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 50        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 55        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 60        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 65        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 70        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 75        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 80        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 85        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 90        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Notes:
- Ensure that the logic implemented adheres to the truth table above.
- There should be no state dependencies or memory elements, as the module is strictly combinational.
- No resets are defined as this is a combinational circuit; hence, initial values for outputs are determined solely by input states.
- Consider edge cases where inputs are at their extreme values (0 or 1) and ensure that outputs remain consistent with the truth table.
