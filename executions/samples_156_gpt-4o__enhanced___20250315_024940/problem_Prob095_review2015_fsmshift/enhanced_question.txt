Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. It is a positive-edge-triggered signal.
  - reset: 1-bit input representing the reset signal. It is active high and synchronous.

- Output Ports:
  - shift_ena: 1-bit output signal that enables the shift register.

Functional Description:
This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the enabling of a shift register. The output signal `shift_ena` indicates whether the shift register should be enabled for shifting data. 

Behavioral Specification:
1. The `shift_ena` signal will be asserted (high) for exactly 4 clock cycles whenever a specific bit pattern is detected by the FSM.
2. Upon reset (when the `reset` signal is asserted), the `shift_ena` signal will be asserted (high) for 4 consecutive clock cycles, followed by a deassertion (low) of the `shift_ena` signal, which will persist until the next reset event occurs.
3. The reset state of the `shift_ena` signal is low (0) when the reset is asserted.

Sequential Logic Details:
- The module's sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- All registers within the module, including the state register that governs the output `shift_ena`, must have explicitly defined initial values upon reset.

Edge Case Handling:
- If the reset signal is asserted while `shift_ena` is already high, the module must ensure that `shift_ena` resets immediately to high for the defined 4 clock cycles before transitioning to low.
- The module must handle input signal changes and ensure that `shift_ena` does not inadvertently remain high beyond the specified 4 clock cycles unless a new valid bit pattern is detected.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output `shift_ena` is dependent on the FSM's state and the detection of the proper bit pattern.
- The precedence of operations must be clearly defined to avoid potential race conditions, ensuring that the reset signal takes priority over the detection logic.

Note: The specific conditions for detecting the bit pattern must be defined in the implementation details of the FSM.
