Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal, active high)
  - x: 1-bit input (serial input bit, least significant bit first)

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output (the least significant bit of the 2's complement of the input)

Functional Specification:
The TopModule implements a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The input (x) represents a series of bits received one per clock cycle, starting with the least significant bit (LSB) of the number. The output (z) provides the least significant bit of the 2's complement of the accumulated input values.

Behavioral Description:
1. **Reset Behavior**: 
   - The areset signal is an asynchronous reset. When areset is asserted (high), all internal registers are set to zero, and the output z is also set to zero.
   - Upon release of the areset signal (transition from high to low), the state machine begins processing the input bits. 

2. **Clock Behavior**:
   - The state machine processes the input bit (x) on the rising edge of clk when areset is not asserted.
   - The conversion process continues until the areset signal is asserted again.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The module will accept a variable-length binary number presented serially via the x input. The input is processed bit by bit, starting from the LSB.
   - The 2's complement operation is defined as: 
     - Invert all bits of the number.
     - Add one to the least significant bit (LSB) of the inverted number.

4. **Output Behavior**:
   - The output z reflects the least significant bit of the current state representing the 2's complement of the input value.

Edge Cases:
- If areset is asserted during the input processing, the state machine will immediately reset and clear the output.
- If the input x remains constant at a binary value (e.g., all zeros), the output will correspondingly reflect the 2's complement of that input.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z depends directly on the internal state of the state machine, which accumulates the input bits as they are received.
- Ensure no race conditions can occur by using proper synchronization on the clk signal.

Initial Conditions:
- All internal registers and the output z are initialized to 0 upon assertion of areset.

Note: All bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[n-1] refers to the most significant bit (MSB) for a number of width n.
