All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input clk\n - input d\n - input q\n\nThe module should implement a single D flip-flop. Assume all sequential\nlogic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Interface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: bit (1) [clock signal, positive edge-triggered]\n  - d: bit (1) [data input]\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: bit (1) [data output]\n\nPort Descriptions:\n- clk: The clock signal that drives the flip-flop. The flip-flop will be triggered on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- d: The input data signal for the flip-flop.\n- q: The output data signal that reflects the state of the flip-flop.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module shall implement a single D flip-flop with the following characteristics:\n  - The flip-flop shall capture the value of the input signal 'd' on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'.\n  - The output signal 'q' shall reflect the captured value of 'd' immediately after the positive edge of 'clk'.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The operation of the flip-flop is defined as follows:\n  - At the positive edge of clk (i.e., when clk transitions from 0 to 1):\n    - q <= d;  // Capture the value of d\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module specification does not include a reset signal. Therefore, the initial value of the output 'q' is not defined, and it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the flip-flop is properly initialized before use.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The specification does not define behavior for clock signal glitches or transitions other than the defined positive edge trigger.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'q' depends solely on the previous value of 'd' at the last positive edge of 'clk'.\n- There are no other signal dependencies indicated in this specification.\n\nAssumptions:\n- It is assumed that no asynchronous reset or enable signals are included in this design.\n- The design will operate correctly under the assumption that the clk signal is stable before and after the triggering edge.\n                    "
