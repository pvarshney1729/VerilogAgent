Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: bit (1) [clock signal, positive edge-triggered]
  - d: bit (1) [data input]
- Output Ports:
  - q: bit (1) [data output]

Port Descriptions:
- clk: The clock signal that drives the flip-flop. The flip-flop will be triggered on the rising edge of this clock signal.
- d: The input data signal for the flip-flop.
- q: The output data signal that reflects the state of the flip-flop.

Functional Description:
- The module shall implement a single D flip-flop with the following characteristics:
  - The flip-flop shall capture the value of the input signal 'd' on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'.
  - The output signal 'q' shall reflect the captured value of 'd' immediately after the positive edge of 'clk'.

Sequential Logic:
- The operation of the flip-flop is defined as follows:
  - At the positive edge of clk (i.e., when clk transitions from 0 to 1):
    - q <= d;  // Capture the value of d

Reset Behavior:
- The module specification does not include a reset signal. Therefore, the initial value of the output 'q' is not defined, and it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the flip-flop is properly initialized before use.

Edge Cases:
- The specification does not define behavior for clock signal glitches or transitions other than the defined positive edge trigger.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'q' depends solely on the previous value of 'd' at the last positive edge of 'clk'.
- There are no other signal dependencies indicated in this specification.

Assumptions:
- It is assumed that no asynchronous reset or enable signals are included in this design.
- The design will operate correctly under the assumption that the clk signal is stable before and after the triggering edge.
