Here is the implementation of the `TopModule` that fulfills the specified requirements for a JK flip-flop:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic j,
    input logic k,
    output logic Q
);

    // Initialize Q to 0
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (j == 1'b0 && k == 1'b0) begin
            // Q remains unchanged
            Q <= Q; // This is valid since Qold is the current value of Q
        end
        else if (j == 1'b0 && k == 1'b1) begin
            // Reset Q to 0
            Q <= 1'b0;
        end
        else if (j == 1'b1 && k == 1'b0) begin
            // Set Q to 1
            Q <= 1'b1;
        end
        else if (j == 1'b1 && k == 1'b1) begin
            // Toggle Q
            Q <= ~Q;
        end
    end

    // Initial block for simulation purposes (initialize Q to 0)
    initial begin
        Q = 1'b0;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with inputs `clk`, `j`, and `k`, and output `Q`.
  
2. **Signal Type**: All ports are declared as `logic` type, as per the coding conventions provided.

3. **Always Block**: The sequential logic is implemented in an `always_ff` block that triggers on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The behavior of the JK flip-flop is implemented based on the truth table provided:
   - If both `j` and `k` are `0`, the output `Q` remains unchanged.
   - If `j` is `0` and `k` is `1`, `Q` is reset to `0`.
   - If `j` is `1` and `k` is `0`, `Q` is set to `1`.
   - If both `j` and `k` are `1`, `Q` toggles its state.

4. **Initialization**: An `initial` block is included to initialize `Q` to `0` on simulation start. This ensures that the flip-flop starts in a known state.

5. **Sensitivity List**: The sensitivity list is implicit for `always_ff`, as specified in the coding conventions.

This module effectively implements the desired JK flip-flop functionality while adhering to the provided guidelines and conventions.
