<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module shall be named `TopModule` and shall implement a JK flip-flop. The interface of the module is defined as follows:

**Input Ports:**
- `input clk`: One-bit clock signal. The flip-flop shall trigger on the rising edge of this signal.
- `input j`: One-bit input signal representing the J input of the JK flip-flop.
- `input k`: One-bit input signal representing the K input of the JK flip-flop.

**Output Ports:**
- `output reg Q`: One-bit output signal representing the current state of the flip-flop. The output Q shall be stored in a register and must be initialized to a known state.

**Behavior:**
The module implements the following truth table for the JK flip-flop, where `Qold` is the state of the output `Q` prior to the rising edge of the `clk` signal:

| J | K | Q (after clk rising edge) |
|---|---|---------------------------|
| 0 | 0 | Qold                      |
| 0 | 1 | 0                         |
| 1 | 0 | 1                         |
| 1 | 1 | ~Qold                     |

**Timing and Initialization:**
- The flip-flop shall operate synchronously with the clock signal `clk`. 
- The flip-flop shall be updated on the rising edge of the `clk`.
- The output `Q` must be initialized to `0` at the start of operation or upon a reset condition if implemented.

**Reset Specification:**
- If a reset signal is implemented, it must be specified as either synchronous or asynchronous, along with the reset state of `Q`.

**Additional Considerations:**
- The module shall handle edge cases, including transitions of `j` and `k` that occur simultaneously with the rising edge of `clk`.
- Potential race conditions should be analyzed and mitigated as necessary, particularly in scenarios where both `j` and `k` are high at the same clock edge.

**Bit Indexing:**
- For clarity, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) of the output `Q`.

All signals must adhere to the defined widths and behaviors to ensure correct implementation of the JK flip-flop functionality.
