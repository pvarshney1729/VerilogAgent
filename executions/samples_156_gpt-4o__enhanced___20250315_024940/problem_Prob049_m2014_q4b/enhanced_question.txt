Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: bit (1-bit wide, positive edge-triggered clock input)
  - ar: bit (1-bit wide, asynchronous reset input; active high)
  - d: bit (1-bit wide, data input for the D flip-flop)

- Output Ports:
  - q: bit (1-bit wide, output of the D flip-flop)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a D flip-flop with the following characteristics:
- The flip-flop is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).
- The asynchronous reset (ar) takes precedence over the clock signal. When the reset signal is high, the output (q) is set to '0' regardless of the clock or data input.
- The output (q) captures the value of the data input (d) at the moment of the rising edge of the clock, provided that the reset signal is not active.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset (ar) is asynchronous and active high.
- When ar = 1, q will immediately be set to '0'.
- On the next rising edge of clk, if ar = 0, q will take the value of d.

Initial Conditions:
- The initial state of the output (q) should be defined as '0' when the module is instantiated and reset is not asserted.

Edge Cases:
- If both ar and clk are asserted simultaneously, the output (q) will be set to '0' due to the asynchronous reset taking precedence.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output (q) is dependent on the d input only at the rising edge of clk when the reset (ar) is not active.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals are considered to be single-bit values; therefore, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.
