Module Name: TopModule

Interface Definition:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input, representing the first operand
  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input, representing the second operand

- Output Ports:
  - output logic out_and;   // 1-bit output, result of a AND b
  - output logic out_or;    // 1-bit output, result of a OR b
  - output logic out_xor;   // 1-bit output, result of a XOR b
  - output logic out_nand;  // 1-bit output, result of a NAND b
  - output logic out_nor;   // 1-bit output, result of a NOR b
  - output logic out_xnor;  // 1-bit output, result of a XNOR b
  - output logic out_anotb; // 1-bit output, result of a AND NOT b

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit that takes two 1-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', and produces seven 1-bit outputs based on basic logical operations. The outputs are defined as follows:
1. out_and = a AND b
2. out_or = a OR b
3. out_xor = a XOR b
4. out_nand = NOT (a AND b)
5. out_nor = NOT (a OR b)
6. out_xnor = NOT (a XOR b)
7. out_anotb = a AND NOT b

Bit Indexing:
- The inputs 'a' and 'b' are treated as single-bit values, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- All outputs are also single-bit values, with the same indexing convention applied.

Signal Dependencies:
- All outputs are directly dependent on the values of the inputs 'a' and 'b'.
- The operations performed on the inputs are purely combinational and exhibit no sequential logic.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible combinations of the input values 'a' and 'b', which can be either 0 or 1, resulting in defined outputs for all combinations.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this combinational logic module, as it does not contain any sequential elements that require initialization or reset behavior.

Race Conditions:
- There are no race conditions in this design as all outputs are derived from combinational logic without feedback loops or sequential dependencies.

This specification ensures clarity in the functional intent while providing explicit details necessary for correct implementation in Verilog.
