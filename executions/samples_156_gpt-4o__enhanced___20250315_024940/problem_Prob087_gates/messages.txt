All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - output out_and\n - output out_or\n - output out_xor\n - output out_nand\n - output out_nor\n - output out_xnor\n - output out_anotb\n\nThe module should implement a combinational circuit with two inputs, a\nand b. There are 7 outputs, each with a logic gate driving it:\n\n  (1) out_and: a and b\n  (2) out_or: a or b\n  (3) out_xor: a xor b\n  (4) out_nand: a nand b\n  (5) out_nor: a nor b\n  (6) out_xnor: a xnor b\n  (7) out_anotb: a and-not b\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

The outputs are defined as follows:\n1. out_and = a AND b\n2. out_or = a OR b\n3. out_xor = a XOR b\n4. out_nand = NOT (a AND b)\n5. out_nor = NOT (a OR b)\n6. out_xnor = NOT (a XOR b)\n7. out_anotb = a AND NOT b\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The inputs 'a' and 'b' are treated as single-bit values, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- All outputs are also single-bit values, with the same indexing convention applied.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- All outputs are directly dependent on the values of the inputs 'a' and 'b'.\n- The operations performed on the inputs are purely combinational and exhibit no sequential logic.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible combinations of the input values 'a' and 'b', which can be either 0 or 1, resulting in defined outputs for all combinations.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are specified for this combinational logic module, as it does not contain any sequential elements that require initialization or reset behavior.\n\nRace Conditions:\n- There are no race conditions in this design as all outputs are derived from combinational logic without feedback loops or sequential dependencies.\n\nThis specification ensures clarity in the functional intent while providing explicit details necessary for correct implementation in Verilog.\n                    "
