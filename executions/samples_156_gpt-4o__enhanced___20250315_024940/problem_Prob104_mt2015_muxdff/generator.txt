Here is the implementation of the `TopModule` according to the specified requirements:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic L,
    input logic q_in,
    input logic r_in,
    output logic Q
);

    // State register for the flip-flop
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (L) begin
            Q <= r_in;  // Load r_in when L is asserted
        end else begin
            Q <= q_in;  // Retain the current state when L is not asserted
        end
    end

    // Initial value for simulation
    initial begin
        Q = 1'b0;  // Initialize Q to 0
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module named `TopModule` is declared with the specified input and output ports.
2. **Logic Type**: All ports are declared as `logic` type as per the coding conventions provided.
3. **Synchronous Behavior**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to define the behavior of the flip-flop, which updates its output `Q` based on the input conditions.
4. **Load Condition**: Inside the `always` block, if `L` is high, `Q` is assigned the value of `r_in`. If `L` is low, `Q` retains the value of `q_in`, demonstrating the behavior of the flip-flop.
5. **Initial Condition**: An `initial` block is used to set the initial value of `Q` to `0` for simulation purposes, which ensures that the flip-flop starts in a known state.
6. **No Asynchronous Reset**: There is no asynchronous reset in this design, adhering to the described behavior.

This module can be instantiated three times in the `full_module` to create a 3-bit storage element.
