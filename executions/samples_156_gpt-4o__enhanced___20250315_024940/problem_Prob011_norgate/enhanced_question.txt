<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - a: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned, representing input signal a)
  - b: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned, representing input signal b)
- Output:
  - out: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned, representing the output of the NOR gate)

Functional Description:
The TopModule shall implement a combinational logic NOR gate. The output `out` will be high (1) only when both inputs `a` and `b` are low (0). 

Logical Operation:
The output is defined by the following logical expression:
out = NOT (a OR b)

Bit Indexing:
- bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) for both input and output ports.

Behavior:
- The module shall always evaluate the output `out` based on the current values of `a` and `b` without any internal state or memory elements.
- There are no edge cases or special conditions to consider as the output is directly dependent on the inputs.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are applicable as this is a purely combinational module and does not contain any sequential logic elements.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output `out` is directly dependent on the values of inputs `a` and `b`. 
- There are no potential race conditions as the output is purely combinational.

Initial Values:
- Not applicable as there are no registers or flip-flops in this module.

Timing:
- The evaluation of the output `out` occurs continuously as per the combinational logic, with no clock cycle relationships involved.
