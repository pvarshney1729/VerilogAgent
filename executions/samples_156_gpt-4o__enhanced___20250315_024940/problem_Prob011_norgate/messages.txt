All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement a NOR gate.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - a: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned, representing input signal a)\n  - b: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned, representing input signal b)\n- Output:\n  - out: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned, representing the output of the NOR gate)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule shall implement a combinational logic NOR gate. The output `out` will be high (1) only when both inputs `a` and `b` are low (0). \n\nLogical Operation:\nThe output is defined by the following logical expression:\nout = NOT (a OR b)\n\nBit Indexing:\n- bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) for both input and output ports.\n\nBehavior:\n- The module shall always evaluate the output `out` based on the current values of `a` and `b` without any internal state or memory elements.\n- There are no edge cases or special conditions to consider as the output is directly dependent on the inputs.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are applicable as this is a purely combinational module and does not contain any sequential logic elements.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output `out` is directly dependent on the values of inputs `a` and `b`. \n- There are no potential race conditions as the output is purely combinational.\n\nInitial Values:\n- Not applicable as there are no registers or flip-flops in this module.\n\nTiming:\n- The evaluation of the output `out` occurs continuously as per the combinational logic, with no clock cycle relationships involved.\n                    "
