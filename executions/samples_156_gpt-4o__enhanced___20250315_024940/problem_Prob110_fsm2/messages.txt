All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  areset\n - input  j\n - input  k\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement a Moore state machine with two states, two\ninputs, and one output according to diagram described below. Reset is an\nactive-high asynchronous reset to state OFF.\n\n  OFF (out=0) --j=0--> OFF\n  OFF (out=0) --j=1--> ON\n  ON  (out=1) --k=0--> ON\n  ON  (out=1) --k=1--> OFF\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: bit (1 bit, active rising edge)\n  - areset: bit (1 bit, active high asynchronous reset)\n  - j: bit (1 bit, input signal for state transition)\n  - k: bit (1 bit, input signal for state transition)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: bit (1 bit, indicates the current state of the state machine)\n\nState Machine Description:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The output signal 'out' reflects the current state of the machine as follows:\n- OFF state: out = 0\n- ON state: out = 1\n\nState Transitions:\n1. From OFF to OFF:\n   - Condition: j = 0\n   - Transition: Remains in OFF state.\n  \n2. From OFF to ON:\n   - Condition: j = 1\n   - Transition: Moves to ON state.\n\n3. From ON to ON:\n   - Condition: k = 0\n   - Transition: Remains in ON state.\n\n4. From ON to OFF:\n   - Condition: k = 1\n   - Transition: Moves to OFF state.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- The reset (areset) is active high and asynchronous.\n- Upon activation of the areset signal, the state machine transitions to the OFF state, and the output (out) is set to 0.\n\nInitial Values:\n- The state machine initializes to the OFF state with out = 0 when areset is asserted.\n\nClock Cycle Relationships:\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal, following the evaluation of j and k inputs.\n\nEdge Case Behavior:\n- The module must handle simultaneous transitions where both j and k are asserted. In this case, precedence is defined such that transitions occur as per the state transition rules defined above without ambiguity.\n  \nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'out' is solely dependent on the current state of the state machine.\n- The next state is determined by the inputs j and k based on the current state.\n\nPotential Race Conditions:\n- Ensure that the state transitions based on inputs j and k do not conflict and are resolved deterministically based on the clock edge.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All input and output ports are single bits, with bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB).\n                    "
