Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: bit (1 bit, active rising edge)
  - areset: bit (1 bit, active high asynchronous reset)
  - j: bit (1 bit, input signal for state transition)
  - k: bit (1 bit, input signal for state transition)

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit (1 bit, indicates the current state of the state machine)

State Machine Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The output signal 'out' reflects the current state of the machine as follows:
- OFF state: out = 0
- ON state: out = 1

State Transitions:
1. From OFF to OFF:
   - Condition: j = 0
   - Transition: Remains in OFF state.
  
2. From OFF to ON:
   - Condition: j = 1
   - Transition: Moves to ON state.

3. From ON to ON:
   - Condition: k = 0
   - Transition: Remains in ON state.

4. From ON to OFF:
   - Condition: k = 1
   - Transition: Moves to OFF state.

Reset Conditions:
- The reset (areset) is active high and asynchronous.
- Upon activation of the areset signal, the state machine transitions to the OFF state, and the output (out) is set to 0.

Initial Values:
- The state machine initializes to the OFF state with out = 0 when areset is asserted.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal, following the evaluation of j and k inputs.

Edge Case Behavior:
- The module must handle simultaneous transitions where both j and k are asserted. In this case, precedence is defined such that transitions occur as per the state transition rules defined above without ambiguity.
  
Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is solely dependent on the current state of the state machine.
- The next state is determined by the inputs j and k based on the current state.

Potential Race Conditions:
- Ensure that the state transitions based on inputs j and k do not conflict and are resolved deterministically based on the clock edge.

Bit Indexing:
- All input and output ports are single bits, with bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB).
