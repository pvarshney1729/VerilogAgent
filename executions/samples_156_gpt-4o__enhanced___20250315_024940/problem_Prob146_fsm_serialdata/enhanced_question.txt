Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - in: 1-bit input (serial data input)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)

- Output Ports:
  - out_byte: 8-bit output (data byte received, valid when done is high)
  - done: 1-bit output (indicates that a valid byte has been received)

Protocol Description:
This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) for a serial communication protocol that transmits data in the following format:
- 1 start bit (logic 0)
- 8 data bits (LSB first)
- 1 stop bit (logic 1)

Behavioral Specifications:
1. The FSM shall identify the start bit (0) and transition to a receiving state.
2. Upon detecting a valid start bit, the FSM shall wait for the subsequent 8 data bits, ensuring they are received in the correct order (from LSB to MSB).
3. After receiving all 8 data bits, the FSM shall verify the presence of a stop bit (1).
4. The `out_byte` output shall hold the received data byte when `done` is asserted (logic 1). The value of `out_byte` is considered don't-care when `done` is not asserted (logic 0).
5. If the expected stop bit is not detected after receiving the data bits, the FSM shall remain in a waiting state until a valid stop bit is received before attempting to process the next byte.
6. The `done` signal shall be asserted high each time a stop bit is successfully detected.
7. The FSM is designed to operate with a synchronous reset. Upon the assertion of the reset signal, all internal state variables shall be reset to their initial states:
   - `out_byte` shall be set to 8'b00000000.
   - The FSM state shall transition to an idle state, ready to receive the next start bit.

Edge Case Handling:
- The module shall handle the idle state where the line is held at logic 1 (no transmission).
- The FSM must account for noise or invalid bit patterns and shall only transition upon detecting valid start and stop conditions.

Timing and Signal Dependencies:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The FSM must ensure that no race conditions occur by clearly defining the state transitions and dependencies based on input signals.

Bit Indexing:
- The `out_byte` output is indexed as `out_byte[0]` (LSB) to `out_byte[7]` (MSB).

Additional Notes:
- The design must consider proper timing margins for detecting state transitions and ensure that the sampling of the `in` signal occurs at appropriate times relative to the `clk` signal.
