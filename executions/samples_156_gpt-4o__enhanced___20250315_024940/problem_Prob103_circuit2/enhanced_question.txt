**Module Name:** TopModule

**Interface:**
- **Input Ports:**
  - `input logic a;`  // 1-bit input
  - `input logic b;`  // 1-bit input
  - `input logic c;`  // 1-bit input
  - `input logic d;`  // 1-bit input

- **Output Port:**
  - `output logic q;` // 1-bit output

**Functional Description:**
The module implements a combinational logic circuit that determines the output `q` based on the values of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The output is defined as a function of the input values, as observed from the provided simulation waveforms.

**Simulation Waveform Behavior:** 
The following table summarizes the output `q` based on the input combinations over time (in nanoseconds):

| Time (ns) | a | b | c | d | q |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 5         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 10        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 15        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 20        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 25        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 30        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 35        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 40        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 45        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 50        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 55        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 60        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 65        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 70        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 75        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 80        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 85        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 90        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Design Constraints:**
- The module operates under the assumption that input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` change at any time without defined clock edges, as it is purely combinational logic.
- There are no sequential elements, and thus no clock or reset signals are specified.

**Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:**
- The behavior of the output `q` should be explicitly defined for all combinations of inputs as shown in the simulation table.
- Undefined input states (e.g., when `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not explicitly 0 or 1) are not specified and should be treated as invalid.

**Implementation Note:**
- Ensure that the logic implemented does not violate any combinational circuit principles, such as avoiding race conditions or glitches.
