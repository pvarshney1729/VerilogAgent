Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - a: 1-bit input (data input)
  - b: 1-bit input (data input)

- Output Ports:
  - out_assign: 1-bit output (result of XOR operation using assign statement)
  - out_always_comb: 1-bit output (result of XOR operation using a combinational always block)
  - out_always_ff: 1-bit output (result of XOR operation using a clocked always block with a flip-flop)

Functional Specification:
- The module should implement an XOR operation between inputs 'a' and 'b' in three different ways:
  1. **out_assign**: This output is generated using a continuous assignment statement (`assign`). The output is defined as:
     - out_assign = a XOR b
     
  2. **out_always_comb**: This output is generated using a combinational always block. The output is assigned as follows:
     - Always block sensitivity list: (a, b) 
     - out_always_comb = a XOR b

  3. **out_always_ff**: This output is generated using a clocked always block which contains a flip-flop. The output is assigned only on the rising edge of the clock signal. The output is defined as:
     - Always block sensitivity list: (posedge clk)
     - reset behavior: The initial value of out_always_ff should be 0 (asynchronous reset behavior is not specified, hence assume no reset).
     - out_always_ff will hold the value of (a XOR b) at the rising edge of clk.

Timing and Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk.
- The output out_always_ff introduces a delay due to the flip-flop, whereas out_assign and out_always_comb provide immediate results based on the current values of inputs 'a' and 'b'.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all combinations of inputs 'a' and 'b', ensuring that for every combination, the outputs reflect the correct XOR operation as specified.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that the outputs are computed based solely on the current values of inputs 'a' and 'b' for out_assign and out_always_comb.
- For out_always_ff, the output depends on the clk signal and the values of 'a' and 'b' at the time of the clk's positive edge.

Precedence of Operations:
- The module should be designed to avoid race conditions by clearly defining the sensitivity lists and ensuring that all outputs are driven correctly based on their respective blocks.
