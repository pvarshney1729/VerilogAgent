Generated Response:

Here is the Verilog code for the specified `TopModule`. The code implements a D flip-flop that captures the output of a two-input XOR gate, as per the given specifications.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

    // Intermediate signal for the XOR output
    logic xor_out;

    // Combinational logic block for XOR operation
    assign xor_out = in ^ out;

    // Sequential logic block for D flip-flop
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= xor_out; // Capture XOR output on the rising edge of clk
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is defined with the name `TopModule` and includes input and output ports as specified.

2. **Signal Declaration**: 
   - All ports are declared as `logic`, which is a preferred data type that supports both combinational and sequential logic.
   - An intermediate signal `xor_out` is declared to hold the result of the XOR operation.

3. **Combinational Logic**: 
   - An `assign` statement is used to compute the output of the XOR gate (`xor_out`), which takes `in` and `out` as inputs. This is done using the XOR operator (`^`).

4. **Sequential Logic**:
   - An `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. The output `out` is updated with the value of `xor_out` whenever there is a rising edge on the clock signal.

5. **No Reset Logic**: 
   - The design does not include any reset functionality, as specified. It is understood that the initial state of `out` will depend on the simulator's behavior, which typically initializes the signal to a known state (usually zero).

This implementation adheres strictly to the provided guidelines and coding conventions, ensuring that it will function correctly in simulation and synthesis.
