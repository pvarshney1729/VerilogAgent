<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - in: 1-bit input (data signal)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (data signal from D flip-flop)

Functional Description:
The module implements a D flip-flop that captures the output of a two-input XOR gate. The D flip-flop is positive edge-triggered by the clk input.

Signal Connections:
1. The XOR gate takes two inputs:
   - Input A: in (1-bit input signal)
   - Input B: out (1-bit output from the D flip-flop)
   
2. The output of the XOR gate is connected to the D input of the D flip-flop.

Sequential Logic:
- The D flip-flop updates its output (out) on the positive edge of the clk signal. 
- There is no reset signal in this design. The initial state of the flip-flop output (out) is undefined; however, it is recommended that the initial state be explicitly defined during implementation to avoid unintended behavior.

Edge Case Behavior:
- Ensure that input signal 'in' and output signal 'out' are stable and valid before the rising edge of clk to prevent metastability.

Additional Notes:
- The design does not include any synchronous or asynchronous reset functionalities. It is crucial to ensure that the system is initialized correctly to avoid unexpected outputs on power-up.
