All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement the following circuit: A D flip-flop takes as\ninput the output of a two-input XOR. The flip-flop is positive edge\ntriggered by clk, but there is no reset. The XOR takes as input 'in'\nalong with the output 'out' of the flip-flop.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - in: 1-bit input (data signal)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output (data signal from D flip-flop)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a D flip-flop that captures the output of a two-input XOR gate. The D flip-flop is positive edge-triggered by the clk input.\n\nSignal Connections:\n1. The XOR gate takes two inputs:\n   - Input A: in (1-bit input signal)\n   - Input B: out (1-bit output from the D flip-flop)\n   \n2. The output of the XOR gate is connected to the D input of the D flip-flop.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The D flip-flop updates its output (out) on the positive edge of the clk signal. \n- There is no reset signal in this design. The initial state of the flip-flop output (out) is undefined; however, it is recommended that the initial state be explicitly defined during implementation to avoid unintended behavior.\n\nEdge Case Behavior:\n- Ensure that input signal 'in' and output signal 'out' are stable and valid before the rising edge of clk to prevent metastability.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The design does not include any synchronous or asynchronous reset functionalities. It is crucial to ensure that the system is initialized correctly to avoid unexpected outputs on power-up.\n                    "
