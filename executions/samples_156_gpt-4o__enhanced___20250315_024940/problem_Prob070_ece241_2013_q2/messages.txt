All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n  - input  a\n  - input  b\n  - input  c\n  - input  d\n  - output out_sop\n  - output out_pos\n\nThe module should implement a digital system with four inputs (a,b,c,d)\nthat generates a logic-1 when 2, 7, or 15 appears on the inputs, and a\nlogic-0 when 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14 appears. The input\nconditions for the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 never occur in this system.\nFor example, 7 corresponds to a,b,c,d being set to 0,1,1,1, respectively.\nDetermine the output out_sop in minimum sum-of-products form, and the\noutput out_pos in minimum product-of-sums form.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a : 1-bit input (LSB: bit[0])\n  - input wire b : 1-bit input (bit[1])\n  - input wire c : 1-bit input (bit[2])\n  - input wire d : 1-bit input (MSB: bit[3])\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out_sop : 1-bit output (LSB: bit[0])\n  - output wire out_pos : 1-bit output (LSB: bit[0])\n\nFunctional Specification:\nThe module implements a combinational logic system that evaluates the 4-bit input represented by the concatenation of inputs a, b, c, and d (with d as the most significant bit and a as the least significant bit). The output signals are defined as follows:\n\n1. The output out_sop (sum-of-products) shall be logic-1 if the input combination corresponds to decimal values 2 (0010), 7 (0111), or 15 (1111). \n2. The output out_pos (product-of-sums) shall be logic-1 if the input combination does NOT correspond to decimal values 0 (0000), 1 (0001), 4 (0100), 5 (0101), 6 (0110), 9 (1001), 10 (1010), 13 (1101), or 14 (1110). \n3. The input combinations for decimal values 3 (0011), 8 (1000), 11 (1011), and 12 (1100) shall not occur and are not to be considered in the design.\n\nOutput Definitions:\n- The output out_sop shall be derived using the minimum sum-of-products form from the specified input conditions.\n- The output out_pos shall be derived using the minimum product-of-sums form from the specified input conditions.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\nThe outputs are purely combinational and depend solely on the current values of the inputs a, b, c, and d. There are no sequential elements or clock cycles involved.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible input combinations of the 4-bit vector [d, c, b, a], as specified.\n- The output logic should be verified against the defined input values to ensure correct operation at the specified decimal values.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are specified for this module, as it operates purely combinationally.\n\nInitial Values:\n- There are no registers in this design, thus no initial values are required.\n                    "
