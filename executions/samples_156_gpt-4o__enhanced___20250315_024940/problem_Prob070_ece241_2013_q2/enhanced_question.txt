Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a : 1-bit input (LSB: bit[0])
  - input wire b : 1-bit input (bit[1])
  - input wire c : 1-bit input (bit[2])
  - input wire d : 1-bit input (MSB: bit[3])
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out_sop : 1-bit output (LSB: bit[0])
  - output wire out_pos : 1-bit output (LSB: bit[0])

Functional Specification:
The module implements a combinational logic system that evaluates the 4-bit input represented by the concatenation of inputs a, b, c, and d (with d as the most significant bit and a as the least significant bit). The output signals are defined as follows:

1. The output out_sop (sum-of-products) shall be logic-1 if the input combination corresponds to decimal values 2 (0010), 7 (0111), or 15 (1111). 
2. The output out_pos (product-of-sums) shall be logic-1 if the input combination does NOT correspond to decimal values 0 (0000), 1 (0001), 4 (0100), 5 (0101), 6 (0110), 9 (1001), 10 (1010), 13 (1101), or 14 (1110). 
3. The input combinations for decimal values 3 (0011), 8 (1000), 11 (1011), and 12 (1100) shall not occur and are not to be considered in the design.

Output Definitions:
- The output out_sop shall be derived using the minimum sum-of-products form from the specified input conditions.
- The output out_pos shall be derived using the minimum product-of-sums form from the specified input conditions.

Signal Dependencies:
The outputs are purely combinational and depend solely on the current values of the inputs a, b, c, and d. There are no sequential elements or clock cycles involved.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible input combinations of the 4-bit vector [d, c, b, a], as specified.
- The output logic should be verified against the defined input values to ensure correct operation at the specified decimal values.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module, as it operates purely combinationally.

Initial Values:
- There are no registers in this design, thus no initial values are required.
