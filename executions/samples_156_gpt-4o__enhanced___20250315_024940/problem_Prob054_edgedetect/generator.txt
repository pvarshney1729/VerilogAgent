Here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that meets the specified requirements and guidelines:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] pedge
);

    // Internal register to hold the previous state of 'in'
    logic [7:0] in_prev;

    // Always block to detect edges on the rising edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Shift the current input 'in' to 'in_prev' at the next clock cycle
        in_prev <= in;

        // Detect positive edges and set the 'pedge' output accordingly
        pedge <= (in & ~in_prev);
    end

    // Initialize 'pedge' to 0 during simulation
    initial begin
        pedge = 8'b00000000;
        in_prev = 8'b00000000;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with inputs and outputs as specified.
2. **Internal Register**: A logic vector `in_prev` is declared to store the previous state of the input `in`.
3. **Edge Detection Logic**: The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. Inside this block:
   - The current input `in` is assigned to `in_prev`, effectively capturing the state of `in` for the next cycle.
   - The output `pedge` is computed using a bitwise AND between the current input `in` and the bitwise negation of `in_prev`. This logic detects the transition from 0 to 1 for each bit.
4. **Initialization**: An `initial` block is included to set `pedge` and `in_prev` to zero at the beginning of the simulation, ensuring that all flip-flops are initialized correctly.
5. **Correct Logic Type**: All ports and signals are declared as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

This implementation effectively meets the requirements and adheres to the specified guidelines and conventions.
