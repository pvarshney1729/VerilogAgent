Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, rising edge triggered)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal, active high)
  - in: 1-bit input (data input signal)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (data output signal)

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: 
  - State A (output = 0)
  - State B (output = 1)

State Transition Diagram:
- Transition from State B to State A occurs on input '0':
  - B (1) --0--> A (0)
  
- Self-loop in State B on input '1':
  - B (1) --1--> B (1)

- Transition from State A to State B occurs on input '0':
  - A (0) --0--> B (1)

- Self-loop in State A on input '1':
  - A (0) --1--> A (0)

Reset Behavior:
- The module shall asynchronously reset to State B (output = 1) when areset is high.
- Upon reset, the output (out) shall be set to 1.

Sequential Logic:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The state of the machine is represented by a single 1-bit register.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up or after reset, the state shall be initialized to State B (output = 1).

Edge Cases:
- The behavior of the module must be defined for all possible input combinations during transitions.
- The output signal (out) is determined solely by the current state of the machine, aligning with Moore machine design principles.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output signal 'out' is a function of the current state only, with no direct dependency on the input signal 'in' for the output state determination.

Precedence of Operations:
- The reset condition takes precedence over the clock signal for state transitions.

Race Conditions:
- There should be no race conditions as the state transitions are clearly defined at the clock edge and reset conditions are handled asynchronously.
