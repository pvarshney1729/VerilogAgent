All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement a Moore state machine with the following\nstate transition table with one input, one output, and four states.\nInclude a synchronous active high reset that resets the FSM to state A.\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n\n  State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output\n  A     | A, B                             | 0\n  B     | C, B                             | 0\n  C     | A, D                             | 0\n  D     | C, B                             | 1\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire clk;            // Clock signal (1 bit)\n  - input wire reset;          // Synchronous active high reset signal (1 bit)\n  - input wire in;             // Input signal (1 bit)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output reg out;            // Output signal (1 bit)\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:\n  - The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.\n  - The states are represented by a 2-bit encoded value (00 for A, 01 for B, 10 for C, 11 for D).\n\nState Transition Table:\n- The transitions and outputs are defined as follows:\n\n  | Current State | Input in=0 | Input in=1 | Output |\n  |---------------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n  | A (00)        | A (00)     | B (01)      | 0      |\n  | B (01)        | C (10)     | B (01)      | 0      |\n  | C (10)        | A (00)     | D (11)      | 0      |\n  | D (11)        | C (10)     | B (01)      | 1      |\n\nState Definitions:\n- State A (00): Initial state; outputs 0.\n- State B (01): Intermediate state; outputs 0.\n- State C (10): Intermediate state; outputs 0.\n- State D (11): Final state; outputs 1.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active high. When the reset signal is high, the state machine transitions to state A (00) on the next positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clk signal. The state of the machine and output are updated synchronously in response to the clock.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up or reset, the state machine will be in state A (00) and the output out will be set to 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The behavior of the state machine is defined for all valid input combinations (in=0 or in=1) and in all states. There are no undefined states or outputs.\n- Ensure no race conditions exist by defining all state transitions and output logic clearly in the always block triggered by the clk signal.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The next state is determined solely based on the current state and the input 'in', with all transitions being synchronous to the clk. The output 'out' is determined from the current state only, conforming to the Moore model.\n\nPrecedence of Operations:\n- State transitions should be evaluated before the output is assigned within the same clock cycle to prevent any unintended behavior.\n                    "
