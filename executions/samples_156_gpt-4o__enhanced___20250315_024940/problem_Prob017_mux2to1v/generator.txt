Here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` implementing the specified 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic [99:0] a,
    input  logic [99:0] b,
    input  logic sel,
    output logic [99:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (sel == 1'b0) begin
            out = a;
        end else begin
            out = b;
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning Behind the Implementation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has the appropriate input and output ports defined in accordance with the specifications.
  
2. **Input and Output Types**: All ports (`a`, `b`, `sel`, and `out`) are declared as `logic`, which is a preferred type in SystemVerilog for representing digital logic values.

3. **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block is utilized to ensure that the output `out` is updated whenever any of the inputs (`a`, `b`, or `sel`) change. The sensitivity list is implicit, as per the coding conventions.

4. **Selection Logic**: Inside the `always` block, a simple conditional statement checks the value of `sel`. If `sel` is 0, `out` is assigned the value of `a`. If `sel` is 1, `out` gets the value of `b`. This effectively implements the 2-to-1 multiplexer functionality.

5. **Initialization and Stability**: Since the module is combinational logic, there is no need for a reset mechanism, and the output is determined directly from the inputs without needing any initial value setting.

This implementation is straightforward and adheres strictly to the specifications provided, ensuring that the functionality of the multiplexer is correctly realized.
