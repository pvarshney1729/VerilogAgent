Module Name: TopModule

Interface Definition:
- Input Ports:
  - p1a: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - p1b: bit[1] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - p1c: bit[2] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - p1d: bit[3] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - p2a: bit[4] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - p2b: bit[5] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - p2c: bit[6] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - p2d: bit[7] (1-bit input, unsigned)

- Output Ports:
  - p1y: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned)
  - p2y: bit[1] (1-bit output, unsigned)

Functional Requirements:
The TopModule should replicate the functionality of the 7400-series integrated circuit, specifically the 7420 chip, which contains two 4-input NAND gates. The behavior of the NAND gates is defined as follows:

1. For the first NAND gate using inputs p1a, p1b, p1c, and p1d:
   - p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d)

2. For the second NAND gate using inputs p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d:
   - p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d)

Implementation Details:
- All input and output ports are 1 bit wide and unsigned.
- The least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0] and the most significant bit (MSB) is bit[1].
- The module is purely combinational and does not have any sequential logic elements or clock dependencies.
- There are no reset signals in this module; therefore, the outputs will be determined solely based on the input states.
- The module should handle all input combinations, including edge cases where inputs are all low (0) or all high (1), yielding the appropriate NAND gate outputs.
- Ensure that no race conditions occur, as the operations are combinational and dependent solely on the immediate input states.

Edge Cases:
- When all inputs (p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d) are 1, p1y should output 0.
- When any input is 0 for p1, p1y should output 1.
- The same behavior applies for the inputs p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d with respect to p2y.

This specification strictly defines the module's interface and functionality in accordance with the behavior of the 7420 chip while ensuring clarity and correctness in implementation.
