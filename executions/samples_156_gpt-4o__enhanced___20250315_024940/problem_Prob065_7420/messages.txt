All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  p1a\n - input  p1b\n - input  p1c\n - input  p1d\n - input  p2a\n - input  p2b\n - input  p2c\n - input  p2d\n - output p1y\n - output p2y\n\nThe 7400-series integrated circuits are a series of digital chips with a\nfew gates each. The 7420 is a chip with two 4-input NAND gates. The\nmodule should implement the same functionality as the 7420 chip.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Definition:\n- Input Ports:\n  - p1a: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - p1b: bit[1] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - p1c: bit[2] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - p1d: bit[3] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - p2a: bit[4] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - p2b: bit[5] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - p2c: bit[6] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - p2d: bit[7] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - p1y: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned)\n  - p2y: bit[1] (1-bit output, unsigned)\n\nFunctional Requirements:\nThe TopModule should replicate the functionality of the 7400-series integrated circuit, specifically the 7420 chip, which contains two 4-input NAND gates. The behavior of the NAND gates is defined as follows:\n\n1. For the first NAND gate using inputs p1a, p1b, p1c, and p1d:\n   - p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d)\n\n2. For the second NAND gate using inputs p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d:\n   - p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d)\n\nImplementation Details:\n- All input and output ports are 1 bit wide and unsigned.\n- The least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0] and the most significant bit (MSB) is bit[1].\n- The module is purely combinational and does not have any sequential logic elements or clock dependencies.\n- There are no reset signals in this module; therefore, the outputs will be determined solely based on the input states.\n- The module should handle all input combinations, including edge cases where inputs are all low (0) or all high (1), yielding the appropriate NAND gate outputs.\n- Ensure that no race conditions occur, as the operations are combinational and dependent solely on the immediate input states.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When all inputs (p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d) are 1, p1y should output 0.\n- When any input is 0 for p1, p1y should output 1.\n- The same behavior applies for the inputs p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d with respect to p2y.\n\nThis specification strictly defines the module's interface and functionality in accordance with the behavior of the 7420 chip while ensuring clarity and correctness in implementation.\n                    "
