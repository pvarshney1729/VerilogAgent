Here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` based on the provided specifications:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic reset,
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    output logic done
);

    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        IDLE = 2'b00,
        BYTE1_RECEIVED = 2'b01,
        BYTE2_RECEIVED = 2'b10,
        BYTE3_RECEIVED = 2'b11
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Sequential logic for state transitions
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic for next state and done signal
    always @(*) begin
        // Default values
        next_state = current_state;
        done = 1'b0;

        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in[3] == 1'b1) begin
                    next_state = BYTE1_RECEIVED;
                end
            end
            BYTE1_RECEIVED: begin
                next_state = BYTE2_RECEIVED;
            end
            BYTE2_RECEIVED: begin
                next_state = BYTE3_RECEIVED;
            end
            BYTE3_RECEIVED: begin
                done = 1'b1; // Signal done after receiving third byte
                next_state = IDLE; // Go back to IDLE to await next message
            end
            default: begin
                next_state = IDLE; // Fallback to IDLE state

        endcase
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with the specified input and output ports.

2. **State Definition**: An enumerated type `state_t` is defined for the finite state machine (FSM) with four states:
   - `IDLE`: Waiting for the first byte of a message.
   - `BYTE1_RECEIVED`: First byte of the message has been received.
   - `BYTE2_RECEIVED`: Second byte of the message has been received.
   - `BYTE3_RECEIVED`: Third byte of the message has been received.

3. **Sequential Logic**: An always block is triggered on the rising edge of `clk`. Inside this block, if `reset` is high, the `current_state` is set to `IDLE`. Otherwise, it updates to the `next_state`.

4. **Combinational Logic**: Another always block is created for combinational logic that determines the next state and the `done` signal. The current state is evaluated, and transitions are defined based on the input `in[3]`:
   - In the `IDLE` state, if `in[3]` is 1, it transitions to `BYTE1_RECEIVED`.
   - Each subsequent state transitions to the next until `BYTE3_RECEIVED`, at which point `done` is asserted high for the next clock cycle.

5. **Default States**: Default cases ensure that the FSM has a fallback to `IDLE` if an unexpected state is encountered. 

This implementation follows the provided guidelines and conventions, ensuring proper functionality of the FSM as per the specifications.
