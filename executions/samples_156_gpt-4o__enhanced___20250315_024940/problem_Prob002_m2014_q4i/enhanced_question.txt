<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Sign: Unsigned
  - Description: This output port shall always drive a constant logic low (0).

Functional Description:
- The TopModule is a combinational logic module that continuously outputs a logic low signal on the 'out' port regardless of any inputs.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The output 'out' shall be defined as follows:
  - out = 1'b0; // Constantly driving logic low (0)

Edge Case Handling:
- There are no edge cases to consider as the output is constant and does not depend on any input signals.

Reset Conditions:
- There is no reset condition specified for this module as it operates solely based on combinational logic without any sequential elements.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- There are no clock cycles involved in this module as it does not contain any sequential logic.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' does not have any dependencies on input signals, as it is a constant output.

Potential Race Conditions:
- There are no race conditions present in this design due to the absence of any input logic or sequential elements.
