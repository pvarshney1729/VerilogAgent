<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Input Ports:
  - in: 1-bit, unsigned (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit, unsigned (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)

Functional Description:
- The output port (out) shall be assigned the same value as the input port (in) through combinational logic.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The assignment must occur continuously and reflect any changes in the input port without any delay.
- There are no sequential elements in this module; thus, no clock cycle relationships or reset conditions are applicable.

Edge Case Handling:
- There are no edge cases or input boundaries to consider, as the input and output are both constrained to a single bit.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output (out) is directly dependent on the input (in) with no additional processing or conditions.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the module correctly synthesizes to a combinational logic circuit where the output follows the input.
