Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) 
    - Description: A 4-bit input vector where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).
  
- Output Ports:
  - pos: bit[1:0] (2 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 2-bit output representing the position of the highest priority (first) '1' bit in the input vector. The output is defined such that pos = 2'b00 if no input bits are high.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 4-bit priority encoder, which is a combinational logic circuit. The output pos indicates the index of the first '1' bit present in the input vector 'in'.
- If there are no '1' bits in the input vector (i.e., in == 4'b0000), the output pos shall be 2'b00.
  
Behavioral Definitions:
- The outputs are determined based on the following conditions:
  - If in[0] == 1, pos = 2'b00
  - If in[1] == 1, pos = 2'b01
  - If in[2] == 1, pos = 2'b10
  - If in[3] == 1, pos = 2'b11
  - If in == 4'b0000, pos = 2'b00

Edge Cases:
- The output pos must be 2'b00 when in is 4'b0000.
- For any valid input combination of the 4-bit 'in', the output pos must reflect the position of the first '1' bit, with priority given to the MSB.

Implementation Constraints:
- Ensure there are no race conditions in the logic determining the output pos.
- Since this is a combinational circuit, there are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved. 

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions as this is purely a combinational circuit.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output pos is directly dependent on the values of the input bits in 'in'. The evaluation of outputs must be performed in a manner that guarantees correct priorities based on the input conditions stated.
