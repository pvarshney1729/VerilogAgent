Based on the provided specifications and guidelines, here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements a 4-bit priority encoder:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic [3:0] in,  // 4-bit input
    output logic [1:0] pos // 2-bit output
);

    always @(*) begin
        case (in)
            4'b0000: pos = 2'b00; // No bits high
            4'b0001: pos = 2'b00; // Bit 0 is high
            4'b0010: pos = 2'b01; // Bit 1 is high
            4'b0100: pos = 2'b10; // Bit 2 is high
            4'b1000: pos = 2'b11; // Bit 3 is high
            4'b0011: pos = 2'b01; // Bits 0 and 1 are high, first is 1
            4'b0110: pos = 2'b01; // Bits 1 and 2 are high, first is 1
            4'b1100: pos = 2'b11; // Bits 2 and 3 are high, first is 1
            4'b0101: pos = 2'b10; // Bits 0 and 2 are high, first is 1
            4'b1001: pos = 2'b11; // Bits 0 and 3 are high, first is 1
            4'b1010: pos = 2'b11; // Bits 1 and 3 are high, first is 1
            4'b1101: pos = 2'b11; // Bits 0, 2 and 3 are high, first is 1
            4'b1110: pos = 2'b11; // Bits 1, 2 and 3 are high, first is 1
            4'b1111: pos = 2'b11; // All bits high, first is 1
            default: pos = 2'b00; // Default case (should not occur)
        endcase
    end

endmodule

### Reasoning:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is defined with the specified input and output ports.
2. **Input and Output Types**: All ports are defined as `logic` type to align with the coding conventions.
3. **Combinational Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to evaluate the output `pos` based on the input vector `in`. This approach ensures that the output is updated whenever any of the input bits change.
4. **Priority Encoding Logic**: A `case` statement is used to check the values of the input bits and assign the appropriate position to the output `pos`. 
5. **Handling of All Cases**: The priority is given to the higher bits, ensuring that the first '1' bit is correctly identified.
6. **Default Case**: A `default` case is included to handle unexpected scenarios, ensuring the output defaults to `2'b00` if none of the specified cases match. However, this should not occur given that all combinations are covered.

This implementation adheres to all specified requirements and guidelines.
