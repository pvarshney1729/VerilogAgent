When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: bit (1) - Clock signal, positive edge triggered.\n  - a: bit (1) - Input signal A.\n  - b: bit (1) - Input signal B.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: bit (1) - Output signal representing the state of the flip-flop.\n  - state: bit (1) - Observable output reflecting the current state of the flip-flop.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a sequential circuit consisting of combinational logic and one bit of memory (i.e., one D flip-flop).\n2. The output of the D flip-flop is observable through the output port `state`. The output `q` reflects the current value of the flip-flop.\n3. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`). \n4. Reset Behavior: \n   - The module does not explicitly define a reset signal. If implementing a reset feature, it should be noted whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and the reset state of all registers should be specified.\n5. The initial state of the flip-flop (output `state` and `q`) must be defined upon startup, e.g., reset to `0` if a reset is implemented.\n6. Combinational Logic: The logic that determines the next state of the flip-flop must be clearly defined based on the inputs `a` and `b`.\n7. Signal Dependencies: Ensure that the output `state` directly corresponds to the value of the flip-flop after the clock edge and reflects the correct state based on the inputs.\n8. Edge Cases: Behavior at edge cases such as simultaneous changes in `a` and `b` must be clearly defined, including potential race conditions.\n9. Time Specifications: The simulation waveforms provided indicate transitions of inputs and outputs. The behavior of the outputs `state` and `q` must be verified against these timing diagrams to ensure correct implementation.\n10. Description of Internal Functionality: The logical relationship between inputs `a`, `b`, and the flip-flop state must be defined in both textual and formal mathematical descriptions (e.g., truth tables) to clarify the intended functionality of the module.\n\nExample Simulation Waveforms:\n- Time (ns), clk, a, b, state, q\n- 0, 0, 1, x, x, x\n- 5, 1, 1, x, x, x\n- 10, 0, 0, 0, x, x\n- Continue listing as provided...\n\nNote: The output values `state` and `q` must be derived from the specified relationship between inputs `a` and `b` at each clock edge.\n                    "
