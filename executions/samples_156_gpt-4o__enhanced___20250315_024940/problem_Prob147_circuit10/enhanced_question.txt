Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: bit (1) - Clock signal, positive edge triggered.
  - a: bit (1) - Input signal A.
  - b: bit (1) - Input signal B.
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: bit (1) - Output signal representing the state of the flip-flop.
  - state: bit (1) - Observable output reflecting the current state of the flip-flop.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a sequential circuit consisting of combinational logic and one bit of memory (i.e., one D flip-flop).
2. The output of the D flip-flop is observable through the output port `state`. The output `q` reflects the current value of the flip-flop.
3. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`). 
4. Reset Behavior: 
   - The module does not explicitly define a reset signal. If implementing a reset feature, it should be noted whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and the reset state of all registers should be specified.
5. The initial state of the flip-flop (output `state` and `q`) must be defined upon startup, e.g., reset to `0` if a reset is implemented.
6. Combinational Logic: The logic that determines the next state of the flip-flop must be clearly defined based on the inputs `a` and `b`.
7. Signal Dependencies: Ensure that the output `state` directly corresponds to the value of the flip-flop after the clock edge and reflects the correct state based on the inputs.
8. Edge Cases: Behavior at edge cases such as simultaneous changes in `a` and `b` must be clearly defined, including potential race conditions.
9. Time Specifications: The simulation waveforms provided indicate transitions of inputs and outputs. The behavior of the outputs `state` and `q` must be verified against these timing diagrams to ensure correct implementation.
10. Description of Internal Functionality: The logical relationship between inputs `a`, `b`, and the flip-flop state must be defined in both textual and formal mathematical descriptions (e.g., truth tables) to clarify the intended functionality of the module.

Example Simulation Waveforms:
- Time (ns), clk, a, b, state, q
- 0, 0, 1, x, x, x
- 5, 1, 1, x, x, x
- 10, 0, 0, 0, x, x
- Continue listing as provided...

Note: The output values `state` and `q` must be derived from the specified relationship between inputs `a` and `b` at each clock edge.
