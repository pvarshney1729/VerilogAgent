Module Name: TopModule

Description: This module implements a half adder, which takes two single-bit binary inputs and produces a single-bit binary sum output and a single-bit carry-out output.

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic a: 1-bit input representing the first operand (a[0] refers to the least significant bit).
  - input logic b: 1-bit input representing the second operand (b[0] refers to the least significant bit).

- Output Ports:
  - output logic sum: 1-bit output representing the sum of inputs a and b (sum[0] refers to the least significant bit).
  - output logic cout: 1-bit output representing the carry-out from the addition of inputs a and b (cout[0] refers to the least significant bit).

Functional Specifications:
- The module shall compute the sum and carry-out based on the following logical operations:
  - sum = a XOR b
  - cout = a AND b

Behavioral Specifications:
- The module operates as combinational logic with no internal state or sequential elements.
- There are no resets or clock cycles involved in this half adder implementation.

Edge Cases:
- The module shall handle all combinations of input bits a and b (00, 01, 10, 11) and produce the corresponding sum and carry-out outputs as specified above.

Dependencies:
- There are no dependencies on other signals or components, as this is a standalone half adder implementation.
