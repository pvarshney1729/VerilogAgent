A half adder adds two bits\n(with no carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription: This module implements a half adder, which takes two single-bit binary inputs and produces a single-bit binary sum output and a single-bit carry-out output.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input logic a: 1-bit input representing the first operand (a[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  - input logic b: 1-bit input representing the second operand (b[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output logic sum: 1-bit output representing the sum of inputs a and b (sum[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  - output logic cout: 1-bit output representing the carry-out from the addition of inputs a and b (cout[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n\nFunctional Specifications:\n- The module shall compute the sum and carry-out based on the following logical operations:\n  - sum = a XOR b\n  - cout = a AND b\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The module operates as combinational logic with no internal state or sequential elements.\n- There are no resets or clock cycles involved in this half adder implementation.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module shall handle all combinations of input bits a and b (00, 01, 10, 11) and produce the corresponding sum and carry-out outputs as specified above.\n\nDependencies:\n- There are no dependencies on other signals or components, as this is a standalone half adder implementation.\n                    "
