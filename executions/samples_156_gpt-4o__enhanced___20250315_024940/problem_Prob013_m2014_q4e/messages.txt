All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in1\n - input  in2\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement a 2-input NOR gate.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire in1: 1-bit input signal (active high).\n  - input wire in2: 1-bit input signal (active high).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out: 1-bit output signal representing the result of the NOR operation.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 2-input NOR gate, which outputs a high signal (1) only when both input signals (in1 and in2) are low (0).\n- The output behavior can be described by the logical expression: \n  - out = NOT (in1 OR in2)\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The input and output signals are indexed as follows:\n  - in1[0]: Least significant bit (LSB)\n  - in2[0]: Least significant bit (LSB)\n  - out[0]: Least significant bit (LSB)\n\nCombinational Logic:\n- The NOR operation is purely combinational, with no sequential elements or clocking mechanism involved.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- There is no reset functionality in this module.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The output (out) should be defined for all combinations of in1 and in2:\n  - If in1 = 0 and in2 = 0, then out = 1 (NOR condition met).\n  - If in1 = 0 and in2 = 1, then out = 0.\n  - If in1 = 1 and in2 = 0, then out = 0.\n  - If in1 = 1 and in2 = 1, then out = 0.\n\nDependencies:\n- The output is directly dependent on the states of both input signals, in1 and in2, with no additional signal dependencies.\n\nPrecedence of Operations:\n- The logical OR operation is evaluated first, followed by the NOT operation to generate the output.\n\nPotential Race Conditions:\n- Since this is a combinational logic implementation, there are no race conditions to consider.\n\nReset State:\n- As there is no reset, the output state will depend solely on the current values of the input signals.\n                    "
