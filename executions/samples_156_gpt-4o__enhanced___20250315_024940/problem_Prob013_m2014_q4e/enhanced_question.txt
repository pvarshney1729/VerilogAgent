Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in1: 1-bit input signal (active high).
  - input wire in2: 1-bit input signal (active high).
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: 1-bit output signal representing the result of the NOR operation.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 2-input NOR gate, which outputs a high signal (1) only when both input signals (in1 and in2) are low (0).
- The output behavior can be described by the logical expression: 
  - out = NOT (in1 OR in2)

Bit Indexing:
- The input and output signals are indexed as follows:
  - in1[0]: Least significant bit (LSB)
  - in2[0]: Least significant bit (LSB)
  - out[0]: Least significant bit (LSB)

Combinational Logic:
- The NOR operation is purely combinational, with no sequential elements or clocking mechanism involved.

Reset Behavior:
- There is no reset functionality in this module.

Edge Cases:
- The output (out) should be defined for all combinations of in1 and in2:
  - If in1 = 0 and in2 = 0, then out = 1 (NOR condition met).
  - If in1 = 0 and in2 = 1, then out = 0.
  - If in1 = 1 and in2 = 0, then out = 0.
  - If in1 = 1 and in2 = 1, then out = 0.

Dependencies:
- The output is directly dependent on the states of both input signals, in1 and in2, with no additional signal dependencies.

Precedence of Operations:
- The logical OR operation is evaluated first, followed by the NOT operation to generate the output.

Potential Race Conditions:
- Since this is a combinational logic implementation, there are no race conditions to consider.

Reset State:
- As there is no reset, the output state will depend solely on the current values of the input signals.
