Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (rising edge-triggered clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (synchronous active-high reset signal)
  - x: 1-bit input (data signal)

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output (output signal)

State Encoding:
- The finite-state machine (FSM) uses a 3-bit state representation, denoted as y[2:0]. 
- The most significant bit (MSB) is y[2] and the least significant bit (LSB) is y[0].

Reset Condition:
- The FSM will reset synchronously on the rising edge of clk when reset is high (1). 
- Upon reset, the FSM will transition to the state y = 3'b000.

State Transition Table:
Present State y[2:0] | Next State (x=0) y[2:0] | Next State (x=1) y[2:0] | Output z
-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------
000                    | 000                       | 001                       | 0
001                    | 001                       | 100                       | 0
010                    | 010                       | 001                       | 0
011                    | 001                       | 010                       | 1
100                    | 011                       | 100                       | 1

Behavior Specifications:
- The FSM operates based on the input signal x. The transitions between states and the output z are determined by the current state y and the value of x at the positive edge of clk.
- Ensure that all state transitions and outputs are correctly implemented according to the state transition table provided above.
- The output z should reflect the correct value based on the current state and the input x as specified.

Edge Cases:
- Proper handling of the reset condition should be ensured, with the FSM returning to state 000 regardless of the current state or input.
- The behavior of the FSM should be well-defined for all values of x (0 and 1) from each state, and no undefined states should exist.

Initialization:
- The FSM's state should be initialized to 3'b000 during the synchronous reset condition.
- Ensure that all registers used to hold the current state y[2:0] have a clearly defined initial state upon reset.
