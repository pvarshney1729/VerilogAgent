Here is the Verilog code implementation based on the provided specifications and guidelines:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out_assign,
    output logic out_alwaysblock
);

    // Continuous assignment for out_assign
    assign out_assign = a & b;

    // Combinational always block for out_alwaysblock
    always @(*) begin
        out_alwaysblock = a & b;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
``` 

### Reasoning:
1. **Module Interface**: The module `TopModule` is defined with the necessary input and output ports, all declared as `logic`, adhering to the coding conventions.
   
2. **Continuous Assignment**: The output `out_assign` is directly driven by an `assign` statement which computes the AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`.

3. **Combinational Always Block**: The output `out_alwaysblock` is defined within an `always @(*)` block, ensuring it updates whenever `a` or `b` changes. This automatically creates a sensitivity list that reacts to changes in both inputs.

4. **No Reset Logic**: As no reset conditions are specified, the implementation does not include any reset logic, focusing purely on the AND operation as required.

5. **Initialization**: Since the outputs are driven by combinational logic, they will reflect the correct values immediately based on the inputs without needing explicit initialization.

This implementation meets all the requirements outlined in the question while adhering to the provided guidelines and coding conventions.

    assign out_assign = a & b;

    // Combinational always block for out_alwaysblock
    always @(*) begin
        out_alwaysblock = a & b;
    end
