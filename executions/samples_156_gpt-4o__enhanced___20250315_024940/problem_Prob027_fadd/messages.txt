All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - input  cin\n - output cout\n - output sum\n\nThe module should impement a full adder. A full adder adds three bits\n(including carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a: 1-bit input representing the first operand (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  - input wire b: 1-bit input representing the second operand (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  - input wire cin: 1-bit input representing the carry-in (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire cout: 1-bit output representing the carry-out (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  - output wire sum: 1-bit output representing the sum of the three inputs (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a full adder. The full adder takes three 1-bit inputs (a, b, cin) and produces two outputs: sum and cout. The relationship between inputs and outputs can be described by the following equations:\n- sum = a XOR b XOR cin\n- cout = (a AND b) OR (cin AND (a XOR b))\n\nBehavior:\n- The module operates on combinational logic, meaning outputs are immediately updated based on the inputs without any clock cycle dependency.\n- There are no explicit sequential elements, and thus no clock or reset signals are defined.\n- The module's behavior will properly handle all combinations of the three input bits, including edge cases where inputs may be 0 or 1.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When all inputs are 0 (a = 0, b = 0, cin = 0), the sum output will be 0 and the cout output will be 0.\n- When inputs are at their maximum (a = 1, b = 1, cin = 1), the sum output will be 1 and the cout output will be 1.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure that all inputs and outputs are treated as unsigned values, as they represent binary bits.\n                    "
