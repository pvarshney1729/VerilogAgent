### Explanation of the Code:
1. **State Definition**: The FSM is defined using an enumerated type (`state_t`) to represent the various states: `IDLE`, `DETECT`, `SHIFT`, `COUNT`, and `DONE`.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The current state is updated on the positive edge of the clock. If the `reset` signal is high, the state goes back to `IDLE`.

3. **Next State Logic**:
   - In the `IDLE` state, the FSM waits for the pattern "1101" to be detected. The serial data is shifted into the `bit_buffer`.
   - In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for 4 clock cycles to indicate that data is being shifted in.
   - The `COUNT` state indicates that counting is happening and waits for the `done_counting` signal.
   - In the `DONE` state, the `done` signal is asserted, and the FSM waits for the `ack` signal before returning to the `IDLE` state.

4. **Signal Initialization**: The `bit_buffer` and `shift_counter` are initialized on reset to ensure correct behavior at the start.

This implementation follows the provided guidelines and coding conventions while ensuring the correct functionality of the timer control FSM.
