The module should compute\na parity bit for an 8-bit byte (which will add a 9th bit to the byte). We\nwill use \"even\" parity, where the parity bit is just the XOR of all 8\ndata bits.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule computes an even parity bit for an 8-bit input data byte. The parity bit is the result of the XOR operation applied to all 8 data bits. This module is intended for use in error detection for data transmission.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire [7:0] in: An 8-bit wide input representing the data byte. \n    - Bit [0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n    - Bit [7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire parity: A single bit output representing the computed parity bit.\n    - This output will be high (1) if there is an odd number of 1s in the input byte, and low (0) if there is an even number of 1s.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The parity bit shall be computed using the following equation:\n  parity = in[0] XOR in[1] XOR in[2] XOR in[3] XOR in[4] XOR in[5] XOR in[6] XOR in[7]\n\n- The module shall operate as combinational logic, meaning the output (parity) is computed continuously based on the current state of the input (in).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module shall handle all possible combinations of the 8-bit input, including all zeroes (in = 8'b00000000) and all ones (in = 8'b11111111). The parity output for all zeroes should be 0, and for all ones, it should be 1.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- There is no reset state defined for this module as it is purely combinational.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output parity is directly dependent on the values of the 8 input bits and is recomputed whenever any of the input bits change.\n\nPrecedence of Operations:\n- The XOR operations shall be evaluated in a left-to-right manner as specified in the functional specification.\n\nPotential Race Conditions:\n- As a combinational circuit, there are no clock cycles or registers involved. Thus, race conditions are not applicable.\n\nThis specification explicitly defines all input and output widths, naming conventions, and the behavior of the module under specified conditions.\n                    "
