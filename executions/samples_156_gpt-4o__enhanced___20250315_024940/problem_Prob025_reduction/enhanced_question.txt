Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule computes an even parity bit for an 8-bit input data byte. The parity bit is the result of the XOR operation applied to all 8 data bits. This module is intended for use in error detection for data transmission.

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire [7:0] in: An 8-bit wide input representing the data byte. 
    - Bit [0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
    - Bit [7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire parity: A single bit output representing the computed parity bit.
    - This output will be high (1) if there is an odd number of 1s in the input byte, and low (0) if there is an even number of 1s.

Functional Specification:
- The parity bit shall be computed using the following equation:
  parity = in[0] XOR in[1] XOR in[2] XOR in[3] XOR in[4] XOR in[5] XOR in[6] XOR in[7]

- The module shall operate as combinational logic, meaning the output (parity) is computed continuously based on the current state of the input (in).

Edge Cases:
- The module shall handle all possible combinations of the 8-bit input, including all zeroes (in = 8'b00000000) and all ones (in = 8'b11111111). The parity output for all zeroes should be 0, and for all ones, it should be 1.

Reset Behavior:
- There is no reset state defined for this module as it is purely combinational.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output parity is directly dependent on the values of the 8 input bits and is recomputed whenever any of the input bits change.

Precedence of Operations:
- The XOR operations shall be evaluated in a left-to-right manner as specified in the functional specification.

Potential Race Conditions:
- As a combinational circuit, there are no clock cycles or registers involved. Thus, race conditions are not applicable.

This specification explicitly defines all input and output widths, naming conventions, and the behavior of the module under specified conditions.
