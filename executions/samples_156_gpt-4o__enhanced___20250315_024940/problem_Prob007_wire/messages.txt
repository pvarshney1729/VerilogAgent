All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nThe module should behave like a wire.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port:\n  - Name: in\n  - Width: 1 bit\n  - Signedness: Unsigned\n  - Description: The input signal to the module.\n\n- Output Port:\n  - Name: out\n  - Width: 1 bit\n  - Signedness: Unsigned\n  - Description: The output signal that directly reflects the input signal.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module shall function as a direct wire, meaning the output 'out' shall be equal to the input 'in' at all times. Specifically, the relationship can be expressed as:\n- out = in\n\nBehavioral Characteristics:\n- This module consists solely of combinational logic. There are no sequential elements, thus no clock cycles are involved.\n- There are no reset conditions since no registers or flip-flops are present in this design.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The module's behavior is well-defined for the single-bit input. The output will reflect the value of the input immediately, with no additional conditions or edge cases affecting its operation.\n- The input 'in' can only take values of 0 or 1, and the output 'out' will match the input value accordingly.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the input 'in'. There are no other signals that influence the output.\n                    "
