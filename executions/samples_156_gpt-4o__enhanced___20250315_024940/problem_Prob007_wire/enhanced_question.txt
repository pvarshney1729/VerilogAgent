Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Signedness: Unsigned
  - Description: The input signal to the module.

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Signedness: Unsigned
  - Description: The output signal that directly reflects the input signal.

Functional Description:
The module shall function as a direct wire, meaning the output 'out' shall be equal to the input 'in' at all times. Specifically, the relationship can be expressed as:
- out = in

Behavioral Characteristics:
- This module consists solely of combinational logic. There are no sequential elements, thus no clock cycles are involved.
- There are no reset conditions since no registers or flip-flops are present in this design.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The module's behavior is well-defined for the single-bit input. The output will reflect the value of the input immediately, with no additional conditions or edge cases affecting its operation.
- The input 'in' can only take values of 0 or 1, and the output 'out' will match the input value accordingly.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the input 'in'. There are no other signals that influence the output.
