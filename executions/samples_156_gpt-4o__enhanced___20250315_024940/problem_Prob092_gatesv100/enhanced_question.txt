Functional Description:
The module processes a 100-bit input vector, in[99:0], to produce three output vectors as follows:

1. **out_both**:
   - Each bit of out_both indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its immediate left neighbor are '1'.
   - For each bit index i (0 ≤ i ≤ 98), the output is defined as:
     - out_both[i] = (in[i] == 1) AND (in[i + 1] == 1)
   - For the most significant bit (MSB):
     - out_both[99] = 0 (as in[99] has no neighbor to the left).

2. **out_any**:
   - Each bit of out_any indicates whether either the corresponding input bit or its immediate right neighbor is '1'.
   - For each bit index i (1 ≤ i ≤ 99), the output is defined as:
     - out_any[i] = (in[i] == 1) OR (in[i - 1] == 1)
   - For the least significant bit (LSB):
     - out_any[0] = 0 (as in[0] has no neighbor to the right).

3. **out_different**:
   - Each bit of out_different indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its immediate left neighbor.
   - For each bit index i (0 ≤ i ≤ 98), the output is defined as:
     - out_different[i] = (in[i] != in[i + 1])
   - For the bit wrapping condition:
     - out_different[99] = (in[99] != in[0]) (in[99] wraps around to in[0]).

Reset Behavior:
- The module does not specify a reset mechanism; however, all output vectors should be initialized to zero at the start of the operation to avoid undefined behavior.

Timing and Logic:
- The outputs are to be computed combinationally based on the values of the input simultaneously, without any clock cycle dependencies.
- No sequential logic is involved; thus, there are no flip-flops or registers within this module.

Edge Cases:
- The module should account for all input bits in the range of 0 to 99. The outputs for out_both[99] and out_any[0] are fixed to zero as specified, which avoids any potential out-of-bounds errors.

Precedence and Dependencies:
- The outputs of out_both depend on the values of in[i] and in[i + 1].
- The outputs of out_any depend on the values of in[i] and in[i - 1].
- The outputs of out_different depend on the values of in[i] and in[i + 1], with a wrapping condition for bit 99.

No race conditions are anticipated as the module operates purely in combinational logic without feedback loops.
