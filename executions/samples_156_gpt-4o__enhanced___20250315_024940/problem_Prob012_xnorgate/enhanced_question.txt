Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: 1-bit input (LSB indexed as bit[0])
  - input wire b: 1-bit input (LSB indexed as bit[0])
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: 1-bit output (LSB indexed as bit[0])

Functional Description:
The module implements a binary XNOR operation on the input signals 'a' and 'b'. The output 'out' will be high (logic level '1') if both inputs are equal (i.e., both are '0' or both are '1'), and low (logic level '0') otherwise.

Logic Type:
- The logic implemented in this module is combinational, with no sequential elements or clock cycles involved.

Behavior:
- When both inputs 'a' and 'b' are the same, the output 'out' should be asserted to high (1). 
- When the inputs are different, 'out' should be asserted to low (0).

Edge Cases:
- For inputs a = 0 and b = 0, out should be 1.
- For inputs a = 0 and b = 1, out should be 0.
- For inputs a = 1 and b = 0, out should be 0.
- For inputs a = 1 and b = 1, out should be 1.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the values of inputs 'a' and 'b'.
- No race conditions are anticipated in this design as it is purely combinational.
