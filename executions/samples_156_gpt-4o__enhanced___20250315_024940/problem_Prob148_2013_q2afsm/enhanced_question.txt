Module Name: TopModule

Input Ports:
- clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
- resetn: 1-bit input (active-low synchronous reset)
- r: 3-bit input (request signals from three devices, where r[0] is the most significant bit (MSB) and r[2] is the least significant bit (LSB))

Output Ports:
- g: 3-bit output (grant signals to three devices, where g[0] is the MSB and g[2] is the LSB)

Definitions:
- The FSM shall have four states: A, B, C, and D.
- The state transition behavior is defined as follows:
  - From state A:
    - If r[0] = 0, r[1] = 0, r[2] = 0, remain in state A.
    - If r[0] = 1, transition to state B.
    - If r[0] = 0 and r[1] = 1, transition to state C.
    - If r[0] = 0, r[1] = 0, r[2] = 0, transition to state D.
  - From state B (g[0] = 1):
    - If r[0] = 1, remain in state B.
    - If r[0] = 0, transition back to state A.
  - From state C (g[1] = 1):
    - If r[1] = 1, remain in state C.
    - If r[1] = 0, transition back to state A.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal (resetn) is active low and is synchronous. When resetn is low, the FSM will reset to state A.
- Upon reset, all outputs g[0], g[1], and g[2] shall be set to 0.

Priority System:
- Device priority is as follows: device 0 > device 1 > device 2.
- Device 0 will be granted access when r[0] = 1, regardless of the state.
- Device 1 will be granted access only if device 0 is not requesting (r[0] = 0) and if r[1] = 1.
- Device 2 will receive a grant only if it is the sole requester (r[2] = 1) while in state A.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential elements, including state registers and output registers, will be triggered on the positive edge of the clock (clk).
- The state register will hold the current state of the FSM.
- The FSM will utilize separate always blocks for state transitions and state storage.

Output Logic:
- The output signals g[i] will be defined based on the current state of the FSM and the request signals, using continuous assignments or always blocks as preferred.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM should handle scenarios where multiple request signals are active simultaneously, adhering to the specified priority.
- The output grants (g[0], g[1], g[2]) should remain unchanged unless a valid state transition occurs or reset is asserted.

Initial Conditions:
- All registers and state variables must be initialized to a known state upon reset, specifically to state A with all grant outputs set to 0.
