        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  resetn\n - input  r (3 bits)\n - output g (3 bits)\n\nThe module should implement the FSM described by the state diagram shown\nbelow:\n\n  A        --r0=0,r1=0,r2=0--> A\n  A        -------r0=1-------> B\n  A        -----r0=0,r1=1----> C\n  A        --r0=0,r1=0,r2=0--> D\n  B (g0=1) -------r0=1-------> B\n  B (g0=1) -------r0=0-------> A\n  C (g1=1) -------r1=1-------> C\n  C (g1=1) -------r1=0-------> A\n\nResetn is an active-low synchronous reset that resets into state A. This\nFSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of\nresource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for\nthe resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either\n_r[0]_, _r[1]_, or _r[2]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and\nrepresents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long\nas there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM\ndecides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to\na state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an\noutput from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 0 has a\nhigher priority than device 1, and device 2 has the lowest priority.\nHence, for example, device 2 will only receive a grant if it is the only\ndevice making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_,\nis given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant\nas long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\nImplement a module that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks\nfor the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures.\nDescribe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment\nstatement(s) or an always block (at your discretion). Assign any state\ncodes that you wish to use. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on\nthe positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

When resetn is low, the FSM will reset to state A.\n- Upon reset, all outputs g[0], g[1], and g[2] shall be set to 0.\n\nPriority System:\n- Device priority is as follows: device 0 > device 1 > device 2.\n- Device 0 will be granted access when r[0] = 1, regardless of the state.\n- Device 1 will be granted access only if device 0 is not requesting (r[0] = 0) and if r[1] = 1.\n- Device 2 will receive a grant only if it is the sole requester (r[2] = 1) while in state A.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential elements, including state registers and output registers, will be triggered on the positive edge of the clock (clk).\n- The state register will hold the current state of the FSM.\n- The FSM will utilize separate always blocks for state transitions and state storage.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output signals g[i] will be defined based on the current state of the FSM and the request signals, using continuous assignments or always blocks as preferred.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should handle scenarios where multiple request signals are active simultaneously, adhering to the specified priority.\n- The output grants (g[0], g[1], g[2]) should remain unchanged unless a valid state transition occurs or reset is asserted.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All registers and state variables must be initialized to a known state upon reset, specifically to state A with all grant outputs set to 0.\n                    "
