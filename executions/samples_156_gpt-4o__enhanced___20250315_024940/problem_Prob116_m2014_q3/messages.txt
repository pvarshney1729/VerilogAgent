All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  x (4 bits)\n - output f\n\nThe module should implement the function f shown in the Karnaugh map\nbelow. d is don't-care, which means you may choose to output whatever\nvalue is convenient.\n\n                x[1]x[2]\n  x[3]x[4]   00  01  11  10\n        00 | d | 0 | d | d |\n        01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |\n        11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |\n        10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - x: 4-bit vector (x[3:0]), where:\n    - x[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)\n    - x[3] is the most significant bit (MSB)\n    - The bits represent the binary values in the following order: x[3] (MSB), x[2], x[1], x[0] (LSB).\n- Output Port:\n  - f: 1-bit output\n\nFunctionality:\nThe module implements a combinational logic function f based on the provided Karnaugh map representation of the inputs. The output f is determined by the following conditions:\n\nKarnaugh Map:\n                x[1] x[2]\n          x[3] x[4]   00  01  11  10\n                00 | d | 0 | d | d |\n                01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |\n                11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |\n                10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |\n\nWhere:\n- 'd' indicates don't-care conditions, allowing flexibility in the implementation of the function f for those inputs.\n- The value of f should be defined as follows:\n  - For input combinations corresponding to '1' in the K-map, set f to 1.\n  - For input combinations corresponding to '0' in the K-map, set f to 0.\n  - For input combinations corresponding to 'd', the output f can be either 0 or 1 based on implementation convenience.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible 4-bit input combinations (0 to 15) and provide defined output for each combination based on the above rules.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The module does not utilize any clock or sequential logic; it is purely combinational.\n- There are no resets required for this module as it does not contain any state-holding elements.\n\nDependencies:\n- Ensure that the implementation accurately reflects the Karnaugh map conditions without introducing race conditions or ambiguous outputs.\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- The output f is stable and valid for any valid 4-bit input in accordance with the defined conditions based on the Karnaugh map.\n                    "
