Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - x: 4-bit vector (x[3:0]), where:
    - x[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)
    - x[3] is the most significant bit (MSB)
    - The bits represent the binary values in the following order: x[3] (MSB), x[2], x[1], x[0] (LSB).
- Output Port:
  - f: 1-bit output

Functionality:
The module implements a combinational logic function f based on the provided Karnaugh map representation of the inputs. The output f is determined by the following conditions:

Karnaugh Map:
                x[1] x[2]
          x[3] x[4]   00  01  11  10
                00 | d | 0 | d | d |
                01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |
                11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |
                10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |

Where:
- 'd' indicates don't-care conditions, allowing flexibility in the implementation of the function f for those inputs.
- The value of f should be defined as follows:
  - For input combinations corresponding to '1' in the K-map, set f to 1.
  - For input combinations corresponding to '0' in the K-map, set f to 0.
  - For input combinations corresponding to 'd', the output f can be either 0 or 1 based on implementation convenience.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible 4-bit input combinations (0 to 15) and provide defined output for each combination based on the above rules.

Assumptions:
- The module does not utilize any clock or sequential logic; it is purely combinational.
- There are no resets required for this module as it does not contain any state-holding elements.

Dependencies:
- Ensure that the implementation accurately reflects the Karnaugh map conditions without introducing race conditions or ambiguous outputs.

Output Behavior:
- The output f is stable and valid for any valid 4-bit input in accordance with the defined conditions based on the Karnaugh map.
