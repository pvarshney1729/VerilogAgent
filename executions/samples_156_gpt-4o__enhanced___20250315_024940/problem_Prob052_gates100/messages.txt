All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in (100 bits)\n - output out_and\n - output out_or\n - output out_xor\n\nThe module should implement a combinational circuit with 100 inputs,\nin[99:0]. There are 3 outputs:\n\n  (1) out_and : output of a 100-input AND gate\n  (2) out_or  : output of a 100-input OR  gate\n  (3) out_xor : output of a 100-input XOR gate\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

Otherwise, it shall be low (0).\n2. out_or shall be high (1) if at least one bit in the input vector in[99:0] is high (1). Otherwise, it shall be low (0).\n3. out_xor shall output high (1) if an odd number of bits in the input vector in[99:0] are high (1); otherwise, it shall output low (0).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If all input bits are low (0), out_and shall output low (0), out_or shall output low (0), and out_xor shall output low (0).\n- If all input bits are high (1), out_and shall output high (1), out_or shall output high (1), and out_xor shall output low (0).\n- If there are an odd number of high input bits, out_xor shall output high (1); if there are an even number of high input bits, out_xor shall output low (0).\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The outputs are directly dependent on the current state of the input vector in[99:0], with no internal state or registers involved, ensuring no race conditions exist.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- This module does not include any flip-flops or sequential elements; therefore, no reset behavior is defined.\n                    "
