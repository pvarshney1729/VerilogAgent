Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[99:0] (100 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 100-bit wide input vector where in[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and in[99] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - out_and: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Output of a 100-input AND gate.
  - out_or: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Output of a 100-input OR gate.
  - out_xor: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Output of a 100-input XOR gate.

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit with the following behavior:
1. out_and shall be high (1) if all bits in the input vector in[99:0] are high (1). Otherwise, it shall be low (0).
2. out_or shall be high (1) if at least one bit in the input vector in[99:0] is high (1). Otherwise, it shall be low (0).
3. out_xor shall output high (1) if an odd number of bits in the input vector in[99:0] are high (1); otherwise, it shall output low (0).

Edge Cases:
- If all input bits are low (0), out_and shall output low (0), out_or shall output low (0), and out_xor shall output low (0).
- If all input bits are high (1), out_and shall output high (1), out_or shall output high (1), and out_xor shall output low (0).
- If there are an odd number of high input bits, out_xor shall output high (1); if there are an even number of high input bits, out_xor shall output low (0).

Signal Dependencies:
- The outputs are directly dependent on the current state of the input vector in[99:0], with no internal state or registers involved, ensuring no race conditions exist.

Reset Behavior:
- This module does not include any flip-flops or sequential elements; therefore, no reset behavior is defined.
