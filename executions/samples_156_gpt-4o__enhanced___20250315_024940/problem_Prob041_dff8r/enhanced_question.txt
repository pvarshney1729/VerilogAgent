Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - d: 8-bit input (data input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB), bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB))

- Output Ports:
  - q: 8-bit output (data output, bit[0] refers to the LSB, bit[7] refers to the MSB)

Functional Description:
- The module consists of 8 D flip-flops (DFFs) arranged in a parallel configuration.
- Each DFF has an active high synchronous reset. When the reset signal is asserted (high) during a clock cycle, the output of all DFFs (q) is set to zero (i.e., q <= 8'b00000000).
- On the positive edge of the clk signal, if reset is not asserted, each DFF captures the corresponding bit from the input data signal d. Specifically:
  - q[0] will capture d[0]
  - q[1] will capture d[1]
  - q[2] will capture d[2]
  - q[3] will capture d[3]
  - q[4] will capture d[4]
  - q[5] will capture d[5]
  - q[6] will capture d[6]
  - q[7] will capture d[7]

Sequential Logic:
- The behavior of the DFFs is synchronous, triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- All flip-flops will maintain their state unless reset or clocked to capture new data.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, all outputs (q[0] to q[7]) are initialized to zero (8'b00000000).

Edge Cases:
- If the reset signal is asserted during the clock cycle, the outputs will immediately transition to zero on the next clock edge.
- If the reset signal is deasserted and the clk signal goes high, the DFFs will update with the current values from the input d.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output states q are directly dependent on the clk and d inputs, with the reset input taking precedence during the reset condition.
