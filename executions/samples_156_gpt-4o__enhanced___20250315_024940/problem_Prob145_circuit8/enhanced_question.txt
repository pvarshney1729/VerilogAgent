Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic clock;     // 1-bit clock signal, active on the rising edge
  - input logic a;         // 1-bit input signal 'a'

- Output Ports:
  - output logic p;        // 1-bit output signal 'p'
  - output logic q;        // 1-bit output signal 'q'

Specifications:
1. The module implements a synchronous sequential circuit that operates based on the rising edge of the clock signal.
2. The reset condition is not specified; therefore, it is assumed that the outputs (p and q) will have an undefined state (x) until the first valid clock cycle. The initial states of outputs should be defined as follows:
   - Initial p = 0
   - Initial q = 0

3. Operation:
   - The behavior of the outputs p and q should be inferred from the provided timing diagram. The state transitions for p and q should be defined based on the values of the input signal 'a' at each clock edge:
     - At clock edges where 'a' transitions, the outputs p and q will be updated according to the timing information.
     - For example, when 'a' is 1 at the rising edge of clock, p and q may reflect a specific state change as observed in the timing diagram.

4. Timing Diagram Observations:
   - The observed values of outputs p and q at each clock cycle must be implemented. The specific logic determining the output values must be derived from the provided time sequence.
   - Edge cases, such as the transition of 'a' from 0 to 1 and back, should be handled appropriately to avoid glitches or unintended state changes.

5. Signal Dependencies:
   - p and q are dependent on both the clock signal and the input signal 'a'. The precedence of operations should ensure that output updates occur synchronously with the clock edges.
   - Ensure that there are no race conditions in the output assignments.

6. Reset Behavior:
   - Confirm whether a reset mechanism is necessary based on the system requirements. If a reset is required, specify whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and define the reset values for p and q.

7. Edge Case Handling:
   - Clearly define the behavior of the outputs when the inputs are at their boundary conditions (e.g., when 'a' is stable at 0 or 1).

Ensure that all logic is implemented in accordance with the specified timing behavior and that the outputs reflect the intended operation as inferred from the provided simulation waveforms.
