When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input logic clock;     // 1-bit clock signal, active on the rising edge\n  - input logic a;         // 1-bit input signal 'a'\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output logic p;        // 1-bit output signal 'p'\n  - output logic q;        // 1-bit output signal 'q'\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a synchronous sequential circuit that operates based on the rising edge of the clock signal.\n2. The reset condition is not specified; therefore, it is assumed that the outputs (p and q) will have an undefined state (x) until the first valid clock cycle. The initial states of outputs should be defined as follows:\n   - Initial p = 0\n   - Initial q = 0\n\n3. Operation:\n   - The behavior of the outputs p and q should be inferred from the provided timing diagram. The state transitions for p and q should be defined based on the values of the input signal 'a' at each clock edge:\n     - At clock edges where 'a' transitions, the outputs p and q will be updated according to the timing information.\n     - For example, when 'a' is 1 at the rising edge of clock, p and q may reflect a specific state change as observed in the timing diagram.\n\n4. Timing Diagram Observations:\n   - The observed values of outputs p and q at each clock cycle must be implemented. The specific logic determining the output values must be derived from the provided time sequence.\n   - Edge cases, such as the transition of 'a' from 0 to 1 and back, should be handled appropriately to avoid glitches or unintended state changes.\n\n5. Signal Dependencies:\n   - p and q are dependent on both the clock signal and the input signal 'a'. The precedence of operations should ensure that output updates occur synchronously with the clock edges.\n   - Ensure that there are no race conditions in the output assignments.\n\n6. Reset Behavior:\n   - Confirm whether a reset mechanism is necessary based on the system requirements. If a reset is required, specify whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and define the reset values for p and q.\n\n7. Edge Case Handling:\n   - Clearly define the behavior of the outputs when the inputs are at their boundary conditions (e.g., when 'a' is stable at 0 or 1).\n\nEnsure that all logic is implemented in accordance with the specified timing behavior and that the outputs reflect the intended operation as inferred from the provided simulation waveforms.\n                    "
