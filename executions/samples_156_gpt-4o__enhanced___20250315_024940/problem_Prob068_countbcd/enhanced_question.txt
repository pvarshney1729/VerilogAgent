Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: input, width = 1 bit, active on the rising edge (positive edge triggered)
  - reset: input, width = 1 bit, active-high, asynchronous reset

- Output Ports:
  - ena: output, width = 3 bits
    - ena[2]: enables the tens digit (q[7:4])
    - ena[1]: enables the hundreds digit (q[11:8])
    - ena[0]: enables the thousands digit (q[15:12])
  - q: output, width = 16 bits
    - q[3:0]: represents the ones digit (0-9)
    - q[7:4]: represents the tens digit (0-9)
    - q[11:8]: represents the hundreds digit (0-9)
    - q[15:12]: represents the thousands digit (0-9)

Functionality:
- The module implements a 4-digit BCD (binary-coded decimal) counter.
- Each BCD digit is represented by 4 bits, with the least significant bit (LSB) at the rightmost position (e.g., q[0] is LSB).
- The counter increments on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The enable signals (ena[2:0]) should be asserted (high) only when the corresponding digit is incremented.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is asynchronous and active-high.
- When reset is asserted (high), all registers (q) should be set to 0 (q = 16'b0000_0000_0000_0000).

Sequential Logic:
- All flip-flops and registers are triggered on the positive edge of clk.
- Upon the assertion of reset, all sequential elements must initialize to 0 regardless of the current state.

Edge Cases:
- The counter should properly handle overflow conditions:
  - When any digit reaches 10 (1010 in binary), it should reset to 0 and increment the next significant digit.
  - The counter must not exceed a value greater than 9999 (i.e., q should wrap around to 0 after reaching 9999).

Dependencies and Timing:
- Ensure that operations do not create race conditions by following a clear sequence of operations during the clock cycles.

Input Boundaries:
- The input clk and reset signals must adhere to the valid timing requirements for setup and hold times as per the synthesized hardware's specifications.

Documentation:
- Provide a truth table for the BCD counting operation, indicating the state transitions for each digit on increment and reset conditions.
