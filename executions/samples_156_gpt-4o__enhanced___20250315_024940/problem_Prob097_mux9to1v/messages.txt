When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

The selection signal 'sel' determines which of the 9 input data lines (a through i) is passed to the output port 'out'. The selection operates as follows:\n- When sel = 0, out will be assigned the value of input a.\n- When sel = 1, out will be assigned the value of input b.\n- When sel = 2, out will be assigned the value of input c.\n- When sel = 3, out will be assigned the value of input d.\n- When sel = 4, out will be assigned the value of input e.\n- When sel = 5, out will be assigned the value of input f.\n- When sel = 6, out will be assigned the value of input g.\n- When sel = 7, out will be assigned the value of input h.\n- When sel = 8, out will be assigned the value of input i.\n- For any value of sel from 9 to 15, out will be set to '1111_1111_1111_1111' (all bits high).\n\nBehavioral Notes:\n- The output 'out' is a combinational signal, updated immediately based on the input 'sel' and the corresponding input data.\n- The module does not include any synchronous or asynchronous resets; the output will default to '1111_1111_1111_1111' if none of the valid cases are selected.\n- The selection of inputs is based solely on the binary value of 'sel', and no additional flip-flops or registers are utilized in the output logic.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all values of 'sel' within the range [0, 15], with proper outputs defined for each case as specified.\n- Ensure that the input signals a through i are valid and stable at the time of selection.\n                    "
