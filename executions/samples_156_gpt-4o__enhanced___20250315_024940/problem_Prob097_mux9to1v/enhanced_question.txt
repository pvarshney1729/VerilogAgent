Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire [15:0] a   // 16 bits, represents the first input
  - input wire [15:0] b   // 16 bits, represents the second input
  - input wire [15:0] c   // 16 bits, represents the third input
  - input wire [15:0] d   // 16 bits, represents the fourth input
  - input wire [15:0] e   // 16 bits, represents the fifth input
  - input wire [15:0] f   // 16 bits, represents the sixth input
  - input wire [15:0] g   // 16 bits, represents the seventh input
  - input wire [15:0] h   // 16 bits, represents the eighth input
  - input wire [15:0] i   // 16 bits, represents the ninth input
  - input wire [3:0] sel  // 4 bits, selects the input to be output

- Output Ports:
  - output reg [15:0] out // 16 bits, the selected output

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. The selection signal 'sel' determines which of the 9 input data lines (a through i) is passed to the output port 'out'. The selection operates as follows:
- When sel = 0, out will be assigned the value of input a.
- When sel = 1, out will be assigned the value of input b.
- When sel = 2, out will be assigned the value of input c.
- When sel = 3, out will be assigned the value of input d.
- When sel = 4, out will be assigned the value of input e.
- When sel = 5, out will be assigned the value of input f.
- When sel = 6, out will be assigned the value of input g.
- When sel = 7, out will be assigned the value of input h.
- When sel = 8, out will be assigned the value of input i.
- For any value of sel from 9 to 15, out will be set to '1111_1111_1111_1111' (all bits high).

Behavioral Notes:
- The output 'out' is a combinational signal, updated immediately based on the input 'sel' and the corresponding input data.
- The module does not include any synchronous or asynchronous resets; the output will default to '1111_1111_1111_1111' if none of the valid cases are selected.
- The selection of inputs is based solely on the binary value of 'sel', and no additional flip-flops or registers are utilized in the output logic.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all values of 'sel' within the range [0, 15], with proper outputs defined for each case as specified.
- Ensure that the input signals a through i are valid and stable at the time of selection.
