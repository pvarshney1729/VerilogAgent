Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - sel: bit[2:0] (3 bits, unsigned) - Select signal to choose one of the data inputs. 
  - data0: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - First data input.
  - data1: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Second data input.
  - data2: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Third data input.
  - data3: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Fourth data input.
  - data4: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Fifth data input.
  - data5: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Sixth data input.

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Output data corresponding to the selected input.

Functional Description:
The module implements a 6-to-1 multiplexer. The output 'out' is determined by the value of the 'sel' input as follows:
- When sel is in the range of 3'b000 (0) to 3'b101 (5), 'out' shall be assigned the corresponding 'dataN' input where N is the value of 'sel'.
- If sel is outside the range 0 to 5 (i.e., sel = 3'b110 (6) or sel = 3'b111 (7)), 'out' shall be assigned the value 4'b0000 (0).

Signal Definitions:
- 'sel' is indexed such that bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
- All input and output ports are unsigned, ensuring clarity in interpretation of binary values.

Sequential Logic:
- The module is purely combinational; there are no sequential elements or clock dependencies involved.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions defined for this module, as it operates solely based on combinational logic without state retention.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle cases when 'sel' has values outside the defined range, ensuring that the output defaults to 4'b0000.

Behavioral Specification:
- The module must maintain consistent behavior upon receiving the same 'sel' input repeatedly, providing the corresponding 'dataN' output without delay or alteration.

Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the current value of 'sel' and the corresponding 'dataN' inputs. There are no race conditions anticipated given the combinational nature of the design.
