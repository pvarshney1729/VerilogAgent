All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  sel   (3 bits)\n - input  data0 (4 bits)\n - input  data1 (4 bits)\n - input  data2 (4 bits)\n - input  data3 (4 bits)\n - input  data4 (4 bits)\n - input  data5 (4 bits)\n - output out   (4 bits)\n);\n\nThe module should implement a 6-to-1 multiplexer. When sel is between 0\nand 5, choose the corresponding data input. Otherwise, output 0. The data\ninputs and outputs are all 4 bits wide.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

The output 'out' is determined by the value of the 'sel' input as follows:\n- When sel is in the range of 3'b000 (0) to 3'b101 (5), 'out' shall be assigned the corresponding 'dataN' input where N is the value of 'sel'.\n- If sel is outside the range 0 to 5 (i.e., sel = 3'b110 (6) or sel = 3'b111 (7)), 'out' shall be assigned the value 4'b0000 (0).\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- 'sel' is indexed such that bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n- All input and output ports are unsigned, ensuring clarity in interpretation of binary values.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The module is purely combinational; there are no sequential elements or clock dependencies involved.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There are no reset conditions defined for this module, as it operates solely based on combinational logic without state retention.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle cases when 'sel' has values outside the defined range, ensuring that the output defaults to 4'b0000.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n- The module must maintain consistent behavior upon receiving the same 'sel' input repeatedly, providing the corresponding 'dataN' output without delay or alteration.\n\nDependencies:\n- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the current value of 'sel' and the corresponding 'dataN' inputs. There are no race conditions anticipated given the combinational nature of the design.\n                    "
