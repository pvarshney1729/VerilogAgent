Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 8 bits
  - Type: unsigned
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 8 bits
  - Type: unsigned
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

Functional Description:
The TopModule shall reverse the bit ordering of the input port 'in' and assign the result to the output port 'out'. The output shall be defined as follows:
- out[0] = in[7]
- out[1] = in[6]
- out[2] = in[5]
- out[3] = in[4]
- out[4] = in[3]
- out[5] = in[2]
- out[6] = in[1]
- out[7] = in[0]

Behavior:
- The operation is purely combinational; changes in the input 'in' will immediately reflect in the output 'out' without any clock dependency.
- There are no edge cases or boundary conditions to consider as the output is directly derived from the input without any restrictions on input values.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that there are no race conditions and that the assignment of output values from the input values is done in a deterministic manner.
