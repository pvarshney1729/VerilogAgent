When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

The output shall be defined as follows:\n- out[0] = in[7]\n- out[1] = in[6]\n- out[2] = in[5]\n- out[3] = in[4]\n- out[4] = in[3]\n- out[5] = in[2]\n- out[6] = in[1]\n- out[7] = in[0]\n\nBehavior:\n- The operation is purely combinational; changes in the input 'in' will immediately reflect in the output 'out' without any clock dependency.\n- There are no edge cases or boundary conditions to consider as the output is directly derived from the input without any restrictions on input values.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions and that the assignment of output values from the input values is done in a deterministic manner.\n                    "
