All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a              (3 bits)\n - input  b              (3 bits)\n - output out_or_bitwise (3 bits)\n - output out_or_logical\n - output out_not        (6 bits)\n\nImplement a module with two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of\nthe two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT)\nof both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not\n(i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule performs bitwise and logical operations on two 3-bit input vectors and provides the results through various output ports.\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input [2:0] a: 3-bit input vector 'a', where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n  - input [2:0] b: 3-bit input vector 'b', where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output [2:0] out_or_bitwise: 3-bit output representing the bitwise-OR of inputs 'a' and 'b'. The result is computed as follows: out_or_bitwise = a | b.\n  - output out_or_logical: 1-bit output representing the logical-OR of inputs 'a' and 'b'. The result is computed as follows: out_or_logical = (a[0] | b[0]) | (a[1] | b[1]) | (a[2] | b[2]).\n  - output [5:0] out_not: 6-bit output where:\n    - bits [5:3]: Inverse (NOT) of input 'b' (i.e., out_not[5:3] = ~b).\n    - bits [2:0]: Inverse (NOT) of input 'a' (i.e., out_not[2:0] = ~a).\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n- The operations are combinational, meaning the outputs are determined by the current values of the inputs without any memory elements or clock cycles involved.\n- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets specified for this module. The outputs are continuously driven based on the input values.\n\nEdge Case Behavior:\n- The module should properly handle all possible input combinations for 'a' and 'b', including the cases where either input is all zeros (000) or all ones (111).\n\nSignal Dependency:\n- The outputs 'out_or_bitwise', 'out_or_logical', and 'out_not' are directly dependent on the inputs 'a' and 'b' with no additional intermediate signals or dependencies.\n                    "
