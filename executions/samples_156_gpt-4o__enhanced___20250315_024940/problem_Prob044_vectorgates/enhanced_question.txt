Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule performs bitwise and logical operations on two 3-bit input vectors and provides the results through various output ports.

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - input [2:0] a: 3-bit input vector 'a', where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
  - input [2:0] b: 3-bit input vector 'b', where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - output [2:0] out_or_bitwise: 3-bit output representing the bitwise-OR of inputs 'a' and 'b'. The result is computed as follows: out_or_bitwise = a | b.
  - output out_or_logical: 1-bit output representing the logical-OR of inputs 'a' and 'b'. The result is computed as follows: out_or_logical = (a[0] | b[0]) | (a[1] | b[1]) | (a[2] | b[2]).
  - output [5:0] out_not: 6-bit output where:
    - bits [5:3]: Inverse (NOT) of input 'b' (i.e., out_not[5:3] = ~b).
    - bits [2:0]: Inverse (NOT) of input 'a' (i.e., out_not[2:0] = ~a).

Behavioral Specification:
- The operations are combinational, meaning the outputs are determined by the current values of the inputs without any memory elements or clock cycles involved.
- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets specified for this module. The outputs are continuously driven based on the input values.

Edge Case Behavior:
- The module should properly handle all possible input combinations for 'a' and 'b', including the cases where either input is all zeros (000) or all ones (111).

Signal Dependency:
- The outputs 'out_or_bitwise', 'out_or_logical', and 'out_not' are directly dependent on the inputs 'a' and 'b' with no additional intermediate signals or dependencies.
