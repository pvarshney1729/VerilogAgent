### Reasoning:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.
2. **Input and Output Types**: All ports are declared as `logic` type for proper synthesis and to adhere to the coding conventions.
3. **Bitwise OR Calculation**: The bitwise OR of `a` and `b` is directly computed using the `|` operator and assigned to `out_or_bitwise`.
4. **Logical OR Calculation**: The logical OR is computed by checking each bit in `a` and `b`, combining them using the logical OR operator, and assigned to `out_or_logical`.
5. **NOT Operation**: The NOT operation is computed for both `a` and `b`, and the results are concatenated correctly to form the 6-bit output `out_not`, ensuring the inverse of `b` occupies the upper half and the inverse of `a` occupies the lower half.
6. **No State or Clock Handling**: The operations are combinational, hence no clocking or reset signals are implemented, simplifying the design.
