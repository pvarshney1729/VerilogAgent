All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  j\n - input  k\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement a Moore state machine with two states, two\ninputs, and one output according to diagram described below. Reset is an\nactive-high synchronous reset to state OFF.\n\n  OFF (out=0) --j=0--> OFF\n  OFF (out=0) --j=1--> ON\n  ON  (out=1) --k=0--> ON\n  ON  (out=1) --k=1--> OFF\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: bit (1) - Clock signal (rising edge-triggered)\n  - reset: bit (1) - Active-high synchronous reset signal\n  - j: bit (1) - Input signal for state transition from OFF to ON\n  - k: bit (1) - Input signal for state transition from ON to OFF\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: bit (1) - Output signal indicating the current state of the machine\n\nState Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with two defined states:\n  1. State OFF: \n     - Output (out) = 0\n     - Transition conditions:\n       - Remain in OFF (out=0) if j=0\n       - Transition to ON (out=1) if j=1\n  2. State ON:\n     - Output (out) = 1\n     - Transition conditions:\n       - Remain in ON (out=1) if k=0\n       - Transition to OFF (out=0) if k=1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high.\n- Upon the assertion of the reset signal (reset=1), the state machine transitions to the OFF state (out=0), regardless of the input signals.\n\nClock Cycle Relationships:\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The state machine initializes to the OFF state, with out=0, when the reset signal is asserted.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle simultaneous transitions, where both j and k are asserted at the same time. The precedence should be defined such that the state machine prioritizes transitions based on the current state:\n  - When in OFF state, j takes precedence to transition to ON.\n  - When in ON state, k takes precedence to transition to OFF.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The outputs are dependent solely on the current state and the input signals j and k.\n- No race conditions are expected as transitions are defined explicitly based on the state and input conditions.\n\nEnd of Specification\n                    "
