Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: bit (1) - Clock signal (rising edge-triggered)
  - reset: bit (1) - Active-high synchronous reset signal
  - j: bit (1) - Input signal for state transition from OFF to ON
  - k: bit (1) - Input signal for state transition from ON to OFF

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit (1) - Output signal indicating the current state of the machine

State Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two defined states:
  1. State OFF: 
     - Output (out) = 0
     - Transition conditions:
       - Remain in OFF (out=0) if j=0
       - Transition to ON (out=1) if j=1
  2. State ON:
     - Output (out) = 1
     - Transition conditions:
       - Remain in ON (out=1) if k=0
       - Transition to OFF (out=0) if k=1

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high.
- Upon the assertion of the reset signal (reset=1), the state machine transitions to the OFF state (out=0), regardless of the input signals.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.

Initial Conditions:
- The state machine initializes to the OFF state, with out=0, when the reset signal is asserted.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle simultaneous transitions, where both j and k are asserted at the same time. The precedence should be defined such that the state machine prioritizes transitions based on the current state:
  - When in OFF state, j takes precedence to transition to ON.
  - When in ON state, k takes precedence to transition to OFF.

Signal Dependencies:
- The outputs are dependent solely on the current state and the input signals j and k.
- No race conditions are expected as transitions are defined explicitly based on the state and input conditions.
