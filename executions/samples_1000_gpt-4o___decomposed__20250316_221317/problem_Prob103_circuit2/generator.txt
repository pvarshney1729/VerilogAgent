<Question>
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output q

The module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation
waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  a  b  c  d  q
  0ns   0  0  0  0  1
  5ns   0  0  0  0  1
  10ns  0  0  0  0  1
  15ns  0  0  0  0  1
  20ns  0  0  0  1  0
  25ns  0  0  1  0  0
  30ns  0  0  1  1  1
  35ns  0  1  0  0  0
  40ns  0  1  0  1  1
  45ns  0  1  1  0  1
  50ns  0  1  1  1  0
  55ns  1  0  0  0  0
  60ns  1  0  0  1  1
  65ns  1  0  1  0  1
  70ns  1  0  1  1  0
  75ns  1  1  0  0  1
  80ns  1  1  0  1  0
  85ns  1  1  1  0  0
  90ns  1  1  1  1  1

Here is the truth table generated from the specification:
                    and here is the corresponding case statement, you should be using a similar structure:
                    case ({a, b, c, d})
    4'b0000: q = 1;
    4'b0001: q = 0;
    4'b0010: q = 0;
    4'b0011: q = 1;
    4'b0100: q = 0;
    4'b0101: q = 1;
    4'b0110: q = 1;
    4'b0111: q = 0;
    4'b1000: q = 0;
    4'b1001: q = 1;
    4'b1010: q = 1;
    4'b1011: q = 0;
    4'b1100: q = 1;
    4'b1101: q = 0;
    4'b1110: q = 0;
    4'b1111: q = 1;
    default: q = 0;
endcase to make sure you are implementing the correct logic.
                    Don't try to minimise the logic, 
                    you may correct the signal names if needed, and use the case statement as is in the final code.

<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.
</Coding Conventions>

<REASONING>
The task is to implement a combinational logic circuit based on the given truth table. The truth table specifies the output 'q' for each combination of the inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The most straightforward way to implement this is by using a case statement within an always block that is sensitive to changes in any of the inputs. The case statement will evaluate the concatenated input vector {a, b, c, d} and assign the corresponding output 'q' based on the truth table provided. This approach ensures that the logic is implemented exactly as specified without any optimization or simplification, adhering to the requirement to use the case statement as provided.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,

    output logic q

        case ({a, b, c, d})
            4'b0000: q = 1;
            4'b0001: q = 0;
            4'b0010: q = 0;
            4'b0011: q = 1;
