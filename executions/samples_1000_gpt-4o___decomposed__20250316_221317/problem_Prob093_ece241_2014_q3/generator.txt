To implement the logic specified by the Karnaugh map using a 4-to-1 multiplexer and 2-to-1 multiplexers, we need to determine the values of `mux_in[3:0]` based on the inputs `c` and `d`. The 4-to-1 multiplexer will use `a` and `b` as select lines, and the outputs of the 2-to-1 multiplexers will be connected to `mux_in[3:0]`.

From the given Karnaugh map, we can derive the values for `mux_in`:
- `mux_in[0]` corresponds to `ab = 00` and should be `d`.
- `mux_in[1]` corresponds to `ab = 01` and should be `0`.
- `mux_in[2]` corresponds to `ab = 11` and should be `c | d`.
- `mux_in[3]` corresponds to `ab = 10` and should be `1`.

We will use one 4-to-1 multiplexer to select between these values based on `a` and `b`. The 2-to-1 multiplexers will be used to implement the logic for `mux_in[0]` and `mux_in[2]`.

- `mux_in[0]` is directly `d`.
- `mux_in[1]` is directly `0`.
- `mux_in[2]` can be implemented using a 2-to-1 multiplexer with `c` and `d` as inputs and `c` as the select line.
- `mux_in[3]` is directly `1`.

This approach minimizes the number of 2-to-1 multiplexers used.
