<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are based on the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` is determined solely by the current state. The reset is a synchronous reset to the OFF state, meaning it will only take effect on the rising edge of the clock. We'll use an enumerated type for the states to make the code more readable. The state transitions and output logic will be implemented using a case statement inside an always block triggered by the clock edge. The output logic will be based on the current state, as per the Moore machine definition.
