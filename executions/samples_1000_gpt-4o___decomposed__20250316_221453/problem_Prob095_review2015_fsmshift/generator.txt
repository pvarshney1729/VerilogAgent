<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles when reset is asserted. The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning the reset signal is sampled on the rising edge of the clock.

The FSM will have the following states:
- `IDLE`: The initial state where `shift_ena` is 0.
- `SHIFT1` to `SHIFT4`: States where `shift_ena` is 1 for 4 consecutive clock cycles.

Upon reset, the FSM should transition from `IDLE` to `SHIFT1` and continue to `SHIFT4`, asserting `shift_ena` in each of these states. After `SHIFT4`, it should return to `IDLE` and remain there until the next reset.

The case statement provided in the question suggests a simple combinational logic based on the `clk` and `reset` signals, but for a proper FSM implementation, we need to consider the state transitions and outputs based on the current state and inputs.

We'll use a synchronous reset, so the reset logic will be inside the clocked always block. We'll use a state register to hold the current state and a counter to track the number of cycles `shift_ena` has been asserted.

The coding conventions require us to use `logic` for all signals and to use `always @(*)` for combinational logic. We'll follow these conventions in our implementation.
