<REASONING>
To implement the state machine as described, we need to define the states and transitions based on the given state diagram. We will use an enumerated type to represent the states for clarity. The state machine will have six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The transitions between these states are determined by the input `w`. The output `z` is determined by the current state, where states E and F produce an output of 1, and all other states produce an output of 0.

We will use two always blocks: one for the state transition logic (state table) and another for the state register (state flip-flops). The state transition logic will be implemented using a case statement, and the state register will handle the synchronous reset and state updates on the positive edge of the clock. The output logic for `z` will be implemented using a continuous assignment based on the current state.
