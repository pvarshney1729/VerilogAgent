To implement the FSM as described, we need to define several states to handle the sequence of operations. The FSM will start in state A and transition through states based on the input conditions. The states can be defined as follows:

1. **State A**: Initial state where the FSM waits for the reset signal to be de-asserted. When resetn is de-asserted, the FSM transitions to state B and sets output f to 1 for one clock cycle.

2. **State B**: This state waits for the sequence 1, 0, 1 on input x. It will transition through intermediate states to track this sequence.

3. **State C**: This state is reached after detecting the sequence 1, 0, 1 on input x. In this state, output g is set to 1, and the FSM monitors input y for two clock cycles.

4. **State D**: If y becomes 1 within two clock cycles in state C, the FSM transitions to this state and maintains g = 1 permanently.

5. **State E**: If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles in state C, the FSM transitions to this state and sets g = 0 permanently.

The FSM will be implemented using a case statement inside an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset will be handled by checking the resetn signal within the always block.

The truth table provided in the question is not directly applicable to the FSM logic, so we'll focus on implementing the FSM logic as described.
