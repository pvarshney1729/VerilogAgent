<REASONING>
To implement the state machine using one-hot encoding, we need to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified interface. The state machine has 10 states, each represented by a single bit in a 10-bit vector `state`. The transitions between states are determined by the input `in`. The outputs `out1` and `out2` are determined by the current state and the input.

The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:
- From S0, if `in` is 0, stay in S0; if `in` is 1, go to S1.
- From S1, if `in` is 0, go to S0; if `in` is 1, go to S2.
- From S2, if `in` is 0, go to S0; if `in` is 1, go to S3.
- From S3, if `in` is 0, go to S0; if `in` is 1, go to S4.
- From S4, if `in` is 0, go to S0; if `in` is 1, go to S5.
- From S5, if `in` is 0, go to S8; if `in` is 1, go to S6.
- From S6, if `in` is 0, go to S9; if `in` is 1, go to S7.
- From S7, if `in` is 0, go to S0; if `in` is 1, stay in S7.
- From S8, if `in` is 0, go to S0; if `in` is 1, go to S1.
- From S9, if `in` is 0, go to S0; if `in` is 1, go to S1.

The outputs are:
- S7: out2 = 1
- S8: out1 = 1
- S9: out1 = 1, out2 = 1

We will use a combinational `always @(*)` block to determine the `next_state` and outputs based on the current `state` and `in`. We will use a case statement to handle the transitions and outputs as specified in the truth table.

The module will not include flip-flops for state storage, as the current state is provided as an input.
