<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as described, we need to define two states, A and B. The state transitions depend on the input `in`, and the output `out` is determined by the current state. The reset is synchronous and active-high, which means the state should be set to B when the reset signal is high during a clock edge.

1. **State Encoding**: We can use a 1-bit signal to represent the two states. Let's encode state B as `1'b0` and state A as `1'b1`.

2. **State Transition Logic**: Based on the given state transition diagram:
   - From state B, if `in` is 0, transition to state A; if `in` is 1, remain in state B.
   - From state A, if `in` is 0, transition to state B; if `in` is 1, remain in state A.

3. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state:
   - In state B, `out` is 1.
   - In state A, `out` is 0.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: When `reset` is high, the state should be set to B on the next clock edge.

5. **Implementation**: Use an always block for sequential logic to handle state transitions and another always block for combinational logic to determine the output based on the current state.

The provided case statement is not directly usable in Verilog as it is, but it guides the logic implementation. We will use a similar structure to ensure the correct logic is implemented.
