<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as described, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are based on the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` depends solely on the current state. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, which means it will immediately set the state to OFF when asserted, regardless of the clock.

1. Define the states using local parameters for clarity.
2. Use a sequential always block to handle state transitions and output logic. This block will be sensitive to the clock and the asynchronous reset.
3. Implement the state transition logic using a case statement based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.
4. The output `out` is determined by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition.
5. Ensure the asynchronous reset is handled correctly by checking it first in the always block.
