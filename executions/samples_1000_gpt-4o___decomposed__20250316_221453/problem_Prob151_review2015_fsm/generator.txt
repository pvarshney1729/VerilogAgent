To implement the finite-state machine (FSM) for the TopModule, we need to define states that correspond to the different phases of the timer operation. The FSM will transition through these states based on the input signals and internal conditions. The states are as follows:

1. SEARCH: This state is where the FSM looks for the pattern "1101" on the data input. Once the pattern is detected, it transitions to the LOAD state.

2. LOAD: In this state, the FSM asserts shift_ena for 4 clock cycles to shift in the duration bits. After 4 cycles, it transitions to the COUNTING state.

3. COUNTING: The FSM waits in this state until done_counting is asserted, indicating the timer has finished counting. It then transitions to the DONE state.

4. DONE: In this state, the FSM asserts the done signal to notify the user. It waits for the ack signal to be asserted before transitioning back to the SEARCH state to look for the next pattern.

The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize the state to SEARCH. The state transitions are controlled by a case statement, and the outputs are driven based on the current state.
