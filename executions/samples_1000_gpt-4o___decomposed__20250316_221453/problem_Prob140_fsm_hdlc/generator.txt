<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes specific bit patterns in a serial data stream. The FSM will have states that track the number of consecutive '1's seen in the input stream. Based on the sequence of bits, the FSM will assert one of the three outputs: `disc`, `flag`, or `err`.

1. **State Encoding**: We will define states to track the number of consecutive '1's. For example, a state for 0 consecutive '1's, 1 consecutive '1', up to 6 consecutive '1's. We also need states for detecting the sequences that lead to `disc`, `flag`, and `err`.

2. **State Transitions**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input bit. If the input is '0', it resets the count of consecutive '1's. If the input is '1', it increments the count. Special transitions occur when specific sequences are detected:
   - Transition to a `disc` state when "0111110" is detected.
   - Transition to a `flag` state when "01111110" is detected.
   - Transition to an `err` state when "01111111" or more '1's are detected.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are asserted based on the current state. These outputs are asserted for one clock cycle after the respective condition is detected.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM should reset to the initial state when the `reset` signal is asserted. This reset is synchronous, meaning it occurs on the rising edge of the clock.

5. **Implementation Details**: We will use an always block for the sequential logic to handle state transitions and another always block for the combinational logic to determine the outputs based on the current state.

By following these steps, we can ensure the FSM correctly identifies the required sequences and asserts the appropriate outputs.
