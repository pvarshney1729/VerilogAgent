<REASONING>
To implement the FSM for detecting a byte in a serial communication protocol with start and stop bits, we need to define several states:

1. **IDLE**: The line is idle, waiting for a start bit.
2. **START**: Detect the start bit (0).
3. **DATA0 to DATA7**: Capture each of the 8 data bits.
4. **STOP**: Verify the stop bit (1).
5. **DONE**: Indicate that a complete byte has been received correctly.

The FSM will transition through these states based on the input bit stream. If the start bit is detected, it moves to the START state, then sequentially through the DATA states as each bit is received. If the stop bit is correct, it transitions to the DONE state, otherwise it returns to IDLE.

The synchronous reset will reset the FSM to the IDLE state. The `done` output will be asserted when a complete byte is correctly received.

The case statement provided in the question will be used to determine the `done` output based on the current state and inputs.
