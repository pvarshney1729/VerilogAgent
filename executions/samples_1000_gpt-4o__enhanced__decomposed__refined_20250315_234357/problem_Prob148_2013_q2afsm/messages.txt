Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n- `input resetn`: Active-low synchronous reset signal. The FSM resets to state A when resetn is asserted low.\n- `input [2:0] r`: 3-bit input vector representing device requests. Bit `r[0]` is the highest priority request, and `r[2]` is the lowest priority.\n- `output reg [2:0] g`: 3-bit output vector representing grants. Bit `g[0]` corresponds to `r[0]`, `g[1]` to `r[1]`, and `g[2]` to `r[2]`.\n\nState Definitions and Behavior:\n- States are represented by an enumerated type or a set of parameters with distinct binary codes.\n- State A: Initial state after reset. Transition to:\n  - B if `r[0] == 1`\n  - C if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 1`\n  - D if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 0` and `r[2] == 1`\n  - Remain in A if `r[0] == 0`, `r[1] == 0`, and `r[2] == 0`\n- State B: `g[0]` is set to 1. Transition to:\n  - Remain in B if `r[0] == 1`\n  - A if `r[0] == 0`\n- State C: `g[1]` is set to 1. Transition to:\n  - Remain in C if `r[1] == 1`\n  - A if `r[1] == 0`\n- State D: `g[2]` is set to 1. Transition to:\n  - Remain in D if `r[2] == 1`\n  - A if `r[2] == 0`\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous. When `resetn` is asserted low, the FSM transitions to state A on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n\nPriority Scheme:\n- Priority is managed such that `r[0]` > `r[1]` > `r[2]`.\n\nDesign Notes:\n- Use separate always blocks for the state register update and the next state logic.\n- State outputs (`g`) can be described using a continuous assignment or an always block.\n- Ensure all flip-flops and registers have explicitly defined initial values or reset states.\n- Handle edge cases where multiple requests are active simultaneously by following the predefined priority scheme.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the FSM for the TopModule follows the given specification and guidelines. The module has a 3-bit input `r` for requests and a 3-bit output `g` for grants. The FSM has four states: A, B, C, and D, which are encoded using a 2-bit state type. The state transition logic is implemented in a combinational always block, which determines the next state based on the current state and the input requests. The state flip-flops are updated on the positive edge of the clock with a synchronous reset, which resets the FSM to state A when `resetn` is low. The output logic is also implemented in a combinational always block, setting the appropriate grant bit based on the current state.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the FSM in the `TopModule` follows the given specifications and guidelines. The module is designed to handle requests from three devices and grant access based on priority. The FSM has four states: A, B, C, and D, with state A being the default state after reset. The state transitions are determined by the input requests `r[2:0]`, with device 0 having the highest priority and device 2 the lowest.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit enumerated type `state_t`, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The `always @(*)` block implements the combinational logic for state transitions. It checks the current state and the request inputs to determine the next state. The priority is handled by checking `r[0]` first, then `r[1]`, and finally `r[2]`.\n\n3. **State Flip-Flops**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the current state on the rising edge of the clock. It also implements a synchronous reset, which sets the state to A when `resetn` is low.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The `always @(*)` block sets the output grants `g[2:0]` based on the current state. Each state B, C, and D corresponds to granting access to one of the devices, while state A results in no grants.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and ensuring that all numeric constants are properly sized. The use of `always @(*)` for combinational logic ensures that the sensitivity list is correctly inferred.\n\nOverall, the implementation is structured to be clear and efficient, following the guidelines for synchronous reset and state machine design.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic [2:0] r,\n    output logic [2:0] g\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (r[0])\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else if (r[1])\n                    next_state = STATE_C;\n                else if (r[2])\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                if (r[0])\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                if (r[1])\n                    next_state = STATE_C;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                if (r[2])\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // State flip-flops with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn)\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        g = 3'b000;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_B: g[0] = 1'b1;\n            STATE_C: g[1] = 1'b1;\n            STATE_D: g[2] = 1'b1;\n            default: g = 3'b000;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
