The implementation of the FSM in Verilog follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The FSM is designed to handle requests from three devices, with priority given to device 0 over device 1, and device 1 over device 2. The FSM transitions between states based on the requests and grants access to the resource accordingly.

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a typedef enum logic type for clarity and ease of understanding. The states are STATE_A, STATE_B, STATE_C, and STATE_D.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The next state logic is implemented using an always block with a case statement. The FSM transitions from STATE_A to STATE_B if r[0] is asserted, to STATE_C if r[1] is asserted and r[0] is not, and to STATE_D if r[2] is asserted and neither r[0] nor r[1] are asserted. The FSM remains in the current state if the conditions for transition are not met.

3. **State Flip-Flops**: The state flip-flops are implemented using an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset is handled by checking the resetn signal, and the FSM resets to STATE_A when resetn is low.

4. **Output Logic**: The output logic for the grants is implemented using an always block. The grants are set based on the current state, with g[0] set in STATE_B, g[1] set in STATE_C, and g[2] set in STATE_D.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the conventions by using logic for all signals, using always @(*) for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

Overall, the FSM is designed to manage resource access based on the priority of requests, with a clear and structured implementation.
