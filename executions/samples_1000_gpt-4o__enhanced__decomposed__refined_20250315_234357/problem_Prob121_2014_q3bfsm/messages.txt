This helps in making the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n3. **State Registers**: Declare `state` and `next_state` as 3-bit logic vectors to hold the current and next states of the FSM.\n\n4. **Synchronous Reset and State Transition**: Implement an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. If `reset` is high, the FSM is reset to `STATE_000`. Otherwise, the FSM transitions to `next_state`.\n\n5. **Next State and Output Logic**: Use a combinational `always @(*)` block to determine the `next_state` and output `z` based on the current `state` and input `x`.
