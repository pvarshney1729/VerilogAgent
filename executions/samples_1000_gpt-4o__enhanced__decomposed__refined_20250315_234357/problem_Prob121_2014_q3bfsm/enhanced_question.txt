Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, triggers all sequential logic on the positive edge.
- input wire reset: Synchronous active-high reset signal, resets the FSM to state 3'b000.
- input wire x: FSM input signal, affects the state transition.
- output reg z: Output signal, determined by the current state.

Port Details:
- All ports are 1-bit wide.
- Inputs are of type 'wire', outputs are of type 'reg'.

FSM Description:
- The finite-state machine (FSM) consists of five states, represented by a 3-bit state variable y[2:0].
- The reset state is 3'b000, and it is entered synchronously whenever 'reset' is high at the positive edge of 'clk'.
- State transitions and outputs are determined by the current state and input 'x'.

State Transition Table:
- Present state (y[2:0]) | Next state (y[2:0]) when x=0, Next state (y[2:0]) when x=1 | Output z
  - 000 | 000, 001 | 0
  - 001 | 001, 100 | 0
  - 010 | 010, 001 | 0
  - 011 | 001, 010 | 1
  - 100 | 011, 100 | 1

Indexing and Bit Conventions:
- The state bits y[2:0] are indexed with y[2] as the most significant bit (MSB) and y[0] as the least significant bit (LSB).

Operational Details:
- All state transitions occur at the rising edge of 'clk'.
- The output z is a combinational logic output based on the current state.
- The FSM is designed to operate correctly under the assumption of a glitch-free clock signal.
- Ensure that care is taken to avoid race conditions by maintaining the synchronous reset and edge-triggered state transitions.

Edge Cases:
- During reset (when 'reset' is high), the FSM state is forced to 3'b000 upon the next rising edge of 'clk', irrespective of the current state or input 'x'.
- The behavior with respect to the input 'x' is deterministic and follows the provided state transition table.
