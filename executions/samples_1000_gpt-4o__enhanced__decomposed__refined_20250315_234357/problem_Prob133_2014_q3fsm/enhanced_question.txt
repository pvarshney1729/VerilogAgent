Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: clk (1-bit, clock signal, triggers on positive edge)
- Input: reset (1-bit, active high, synchronous reset)
- Input: s (1-bit, used in state A to transition to state B when high)
- Input: w (1-bit, examined in state B over three consecutive clock cycles)
- Output: z (1-bit, outputs 1 if condition met, otherwise 0)

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- Initial State: A (reset state)
  - Action: Remain in state A while s = 0.
  - Transition: Move to state B when s = 1.
  
- State B:
  - The FSM monitors the input w over three consecutive clock cycles.
  - Condition: If w equals 1 during exactly two of these three cycles, set output z = 1 in the immediate next clock cycle. Otherwise, set z = 0.
  - Continuation: After evaluating w over three cycles and setting z, the FSM continues monitoring w for the next set of three cycles.

Reset and Initialization:
- Reset: The FSM transitions to state A when reset is high. All internal registers related to FSM state and cycle counting are reset to their initial values.
- Initial Value: Assume all sequential elements (e.g., state registers, cycle counters) are initialized to zero upon reset.

Signal Details:
- s is only evaluated in state A.
- In state B, only the w input is relevant for determining the output z.
- z is updated based on the evaluation of w in the previous three cycles.

Additional Clarifications:
- All registers and flip-flops are edge-triggered on the positive edge of clk.
- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all ports are 1-bit.
- Edge Cases: Ensure proper handling when transitioning from state A to B and subsequent evaluations in state B.
