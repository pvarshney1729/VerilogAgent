Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: clk (1-bit, clock signal, triggers on positive edge)\n- Input: reset (1-bit, active high, synchronous reset)\n- Input: s (1-bit, used in state A to transition to state B when high)\n- Input: w (1-bit, examined in state B over three consecutive clock cycles)\n- Output: z (1-bit, outputs 1 if condition met, otherwise 0)\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- Initial State: A (reset state)\n  - Action: Remain in state A while s = 0.\n  - Transition: Move to state B when s = 1.\n  \n- State B:\n  - The FSM monitors the input w over three consecutive clock cycles.\n  - Condition: If w equals 1 during exactly two of these three cycles, set output z = 1 in the immediate next clock cycle. Otherwise, set z = 0.\n  - Continuation: After evaluating w over three cycles and setting z, the FSM continues monitoring w for the next set of three cycles.\n\nReset and Initialization:\n- Reset: The FSM transitions to state A when reset is high. All internal registers related to FSM state and cycle counting are reset to their initial values.\n- Initial Value: Assume all sequential elements (e.g., state registers, cycle counters) are initialized to zero upon reset.\n\nSignal Details:\n- s is only evaluated in state A.\n- In state B, only the w input is relevant for determining the output z.\n- z is updated based on the evaluation of w in the previous three cycles.\n\nAdditional Clarifications:\n- All registers and flip-flops are edge-triggered on the positive edge of clk.\n- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all ports are 1-bit.\n- Edge Cases: Ensure proper handling when transitioning from state A to B and subsequent evaluations in state B.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of a finite state machine (FSM) with the given inputs and outputs. The FSM is designed to transition between states based on the inputs `s` and `w`, and it outputs `z` based on the conditions specified.\n\n1. **State Definitions**: The FSM has five states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B1`, `STATE_B2`, `STATE_B3`, and `STATE_C`. `STATE_A` is the initial state where the FSM waits for `s` to be 1 to transition to `STATE_B1`. The states `STATE_B1`, `STATE_B2`, and `STATE_B3` are used to count the occurrences of `w` being 1 over three clock cycles. `STATE_C` is used to evaluate the count and set the output `z`.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM transitions from `STATE_A` to `STATE_B1` when `s` is 1. It then moves sequentially through `STATE_B1`, `STATE_B2`, and `STATE_B3`, counting the number of times `w` is 1. After `STATE_B3`, it transitions to `STATE_C` to evaluate the count.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: In `STATE_C`, if `w` was 1 exactly twice in the previous three cycles, `z` is set to 1; otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The count is reset after evaluation to prepare for the next cycle of counting.\n\n4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM uses a synchronous reset, which initializes the state to `STATE_A` and resets the count and output `z`.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for signal declarations, and `always_ff` for sequential logic with synchronous reset. The `always @(*)` block is used for combinational logic to determine the next state.\n\nThis design ensures that the FSM behaves as specified, transitioning through states and evaluating inputs correctly to produce the desired output.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic s,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A  = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B1 = 3'b001,\n        STATE_B2 = 3'b010,\n        STATE_B3 = 3'b011,\n        STATE_C  = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] w_count; // Counter for 'w' being 1\n\n    // State transition and output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            w_count <= 2'b00;\n            z <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == STATE_B1 || current_state == STATE_B2 || current_state == STATE_B3) begin\n                if (w) w_count <= w_count + 1;\n            end\n            if (current_state == STATE_C) begin\n                if (w_count == 2'b10) z <= 1'b1;\n                else z <= 1'b0;\n                w_count <= 2'b00; // Reset count for next cycle\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (s) next_state = STATE_B1;\n                else next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_B1: next_state = STATE_B2;\n            STATE_B2: next_state = STATE_B3;\n            STATE_B3: next_state = STATE_C;\n            STATE_C:  next_state = STATE_B1;\n            default:  next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
