Module Name: `TopModule`

Interface:
- **Inputs**
  - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [9:0] state`: A 10-bit input representing the current state using one-hot encoding. Each bit corresponds to a state from S0 to S9, with `state[0]` for S0 and `state[9]` for S9.

- **Outputs**
  - `output wire [9:0] next_state`: A 10-bit output representing the next state in one-hot encoding. Each bit corresponds to a state from S0 to S9, with `next_state[0]` for S0 and `next_state[9]` for S9.
  - `output wire out1, out2`: Single-bit output signals as specified by state transitions.

State Machine Specification:
- The state machine employs one-hot encoding; thus, only one bit in `state[9:0]` is expected to be high at any given time under normal operation.
- The next state is determined by the current state and the input `in`.

State Transitions:
- From State S0:
  - If `in == 0`, remain in S0.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S1.
- From State S1:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S0.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S2.
- From State S2:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S0.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S3.
- From State S3:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S0.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S4.
- From State S4:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S0.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S5.
- From State S5:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S8.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S6.
- From State S6:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S9.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S7.
- From State S7:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S0.
  - If `in == 1`, remain in S7.
- From State S8:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S0.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S1.
- From State S9:
  - If `in == 0`, transition to S0.
  - If `in == 1`, transition to S1.

Outputs:
- Default outputs `out1` and `out2` are 0, except:
  - In State S7: `out1 = 0`, `out2 = 1`.
  - In State S8: `out1 = 1`, `out2 = 0`.
  - In State S9: `out1 = 1`, `out2 = 1`.

Additional Implementation Notes:
- The module should handle cases where multiple bits in `state[9:0]` are set (non-standard operation) by processing each active state independently according to the transition rules.
- The state machine should not implement internal state flip-flops or registers; it purely computes `next_state` and the outputs based on the provided `state` and `in` inputs.
