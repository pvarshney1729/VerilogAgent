The implementation of the `TopModule` follows a finite state machine (FSM) approach to handle the serial communication protocol described. The FSM consists of five states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP, and ERROR. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit logic vector. This allows for up to 8 different states, though only 5 are used in this design.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The `always_ff` block is used to update the current state and bit count on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset is implemented by checking the `reset` signal within this block, ensuring that the FSM returns to the IDLE state and the bit count is reset to zero when `reset` is high.

3. **Next State Logic**: The `always_comb` block determines the next state based on the current state and input conditions. The `done` signal is also set within this block, indicating when a byte has been correctly received.

   - **IDLE**: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0) to transition to the START state.
   - **START**: The FSM transitions to the DATA state to begin receiving the data bits.
   - **DATA**: The FSM counts the received data bits. Once 8 bits are received, it transitions to the STOP state.
   - **STOP**: The FSM checks for a stop bit (logic 1). If correct, it transitions back to IDLE and sets `done` high. If incorrect, it transitions to the ERROR state.
   - **ERROR**: The FSM waits for the line to return to idle (logic 1) before transitioning back to IDLE.

4. **Bit Count**: A 4-bit counter is used to track the number of data bits received. This counter is incremented during the DATA state and reset in other states.

5. **Output Logic**: The `done` signal is set high when a byte is correctly received, specifically during the transition from STOP to IDLE with a correct stop bit.

This design ensures that the FSM correctly identifies and processes the start bit, 8 data bits, and stop bit, handling errors by transitioning to an ERROR state when necessary.
