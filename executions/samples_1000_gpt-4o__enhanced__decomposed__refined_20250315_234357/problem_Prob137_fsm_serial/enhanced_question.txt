Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, positive edge-triggered clock input.
  - reset: 1-bit, active-high synchronous reset input.
  - in: 1-bit, serial data input.

- Output Ports:
  - done: 1-bit, indicates a correctly received byte sequence.

Design Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify correctly received bytes in a serial communication stream. The protocol consists of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The line is idle at logic level 1.

FSM States:
1. IDLE: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0).
2. RECEIVE: The FSM receives 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit first.
3. VERIFY_STOP: The FSM checks for a stop bit (logic 1).
4. DONE: The FSM sets the done output high if the byte is correctly received.
5. ERROR: The FSM enters this state if the stop bit is incorrect and waits for the next start bit.

Behavioral Details:
- The FSM transitions from IDLE to RECEIVE upon detecting a start bit.
- During the RECEIVE state, 8 bits are sequentially captured, with each bit being stored on the rising edge of clk.
- After receiving 8 bits, the FSM transitions to VERIFY_STOP to check the stop bit.
- If the stop bit is correct, the FSM transitions to DONE, and the done signal is asserted high for one clock cycle.
- If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM transitions to ERROR, where it waits for the next correct start bit.

Edge Cases:
- Only valid start bits (logic 0) initiate the byte reception process.
- The FSM resets to the IDLE state upon a synchronous reset (active-high) or if the line remains idle (logic 1) beyond expected timing during ERROR.

Signal Dependencies:
- The FSM is fully synchronous, with all state transitions and operations occurring on the positive edge of clk.
- The in signal is sampled on the rising edge of clk.

Initial Conditions:
- On synchronous reset (active-high), the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and the done output is set to logic 0.

Bit Indexing:
- The least significant bit (LSB) is received first, and bit[0] refers to the LSB of the data byte.
