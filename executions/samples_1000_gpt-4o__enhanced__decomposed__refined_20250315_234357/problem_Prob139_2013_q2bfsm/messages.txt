        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPorts:\n- input  logic clk                // Clock signal (positive edge-triggered)\n- input  logic resetn             // Synchronous active-low reset signal\n- input  logic x                  // Input signal from motor\n- input  logic y                  // Input signal from motor\n- output logic f                  // Output signal controlling the motor\n- output logic g                  // Output signal controlling the motor\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n1. The FSM operates using a synchronous, active-low reset signal (`resetn`). The FSM remains in the initial state, \"State A,\" as long as `resetn` is asserted (low).\n2. Upon de-assertion of `resetn` (resetn becomes high), the FSM transitions from State A on the next positive edge of `clk` and sets the output `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.\n3. The FSM then continuously monitors the input `x` for the sequence \"1, 0, 1\" over three successive clock cycles:\n   - If `x` produces the sequence \"1, 0, 1\" on three successive positive clock edges, the output `g` is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.\n4. When `g` is set to 1, the FSM monitors the input `y` for two consecutive clock cycles:\n   - If `y` is 1 within these two clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently (until reset).\n   - If `y` does not become 1 within these two clock cycles, `g` is set to 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- All state transitions and outputs changes are synchronized to the positive edge of `clk`.\n- `resetn` must be asserted (held low) to reset the FSM to State A and initialize all outputs to their default states.\n- Upon reset de-assertion (resetn goes high), the FSM begins its functional behavior as specified.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset (resetn = 0), the FSM initializes to State A.\n- Outputs `f` and `g` are initialized to 0 upon reset.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All signals are single bit, with `bit[0]` being the least significant bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should correctly handle cases where `x` does not produce \"1, 0, 1\" in sequence or if `y` is not 1 in the specified monitoring period.\n- The behavior specified assumes no glitches on the input signals `x` and `y` and that transitions occur strictly on clock edges.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specification for a finite state machine (FSM) with synchronous reset and specific input/output behavior. The FSM is designed to control a motor based on inputs `x` and `y`, and outputs `f` and `g`.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses an enumerated type `state_t` to define six states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, `STATE_D`, `STATE_E`, and `STATE_F`. Each state corresponds to a specific part of the FSM's operation as described in the specification.\n\n2. **State Transitions**: The FSM transitions between states based on the inputs `x` and `y`, as well as internal counters. The transitions are defined in an `always_comb` block, which determines the `next_state` based on the `current_state` and input conditions.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `f` and `g` are controlled within an `always_ff` block, which updates the outputs and internal counters on the positive edge of the clock. The output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle when transitioning from `STATE_A` to `STATE_B`. The output `g` is set to 1 when the sequence \"1, 0, 1\" is detected on `x` and remains 1 or 0 based on the value of `y` within two clock cycles.\n\n4. **Counters**: Two counters are used: `x_sequence` to track the sequence of `x` values and `y_counter` to count the clock cycles while monitoring `y`.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM uses a synchronous, active-low reset (`resetn`). When `resetn` is low, the FSM resets to `STATE_A`, and all outputs and counters are initialized to 0.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic without explicitly specifying sensitivity lists.\n\nThe FSM is designed to operate correctly based on the provided specification, ensuring that the outputs `f` and `g` are generated with the correct timing and conditions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic x,\n    input logic y,\n    output logic f,\n    output logic g\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] x_sequence;\n    logic [1:0] y_counter;\n\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            x_sequence <= 2'b00;\n            y_counter <= 2'b00;\n            f <= 1'b0;\n            g <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            case (current_state)\n                STATE_A: begin\n                    f <= 1'b0;\n                    g <= 1'b0;\n                end\n                STATE_B: begin\n                    f <= 1'b1;\n                end\n                STATE_C: begin\n                    f <= 1'b0;\n                    x_sequence <= {x_sequence[0], x};\n                end\n                STATE_D: begin\n                    g <= 1'b1;\n                    if (y_counter < 2'b10)\n                        y_counter <= y_counter + 1;\n                end\n                STATE_E: begin\n                    g <= 1'b1;\n                end\n                STATE_F: begin\n                    g <= 1'b0;\n                end\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\n\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (resetn)\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                next_state = STATE_C;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                if (x_sequence == 2'b10 && x == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                if (y == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = STATE_E;\n                else if (y_counter == 2'b10)\n                    next_state = STATE_F;\n            end\n            STATE_E: begin\n                // Remain in STATE_E\n            end\n            STATE_F: begin\n                // Remain in STATE_F\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

A counter (`y_counter`) is used to track the number of clock cycles.\n\n5. **State E**: If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently.\n\n6. **State F**: If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, `g` is set to 0 permanently.\n\nThe FSM is implemented using a combination of sequential logic (for state transitions and output updates) and combinational logic (for determining the next state). The synchronous reset is handled by checking `resetn` at the positive edge of the clock.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic x,\n    input logic y,\n    output logic f,\n    output logic g\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] x_sequence;\n    logic [1:0] y_counter;\n\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            x_sequence <= 2'b00;\n            y_counter <= 2'b00;\n            f <= 1'b0;\n            g <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            case (current_state)\n                STATE_A: begin\n                    f <= 1'b0;\n                    g <= 1'b0;\n                end\n                STATE_B: begin\n                    f <= 1'b1;\n                end\n                STATE_C: begin\n                    f <= 1'b0;\n                    x_sequence <= {x_sequence[0], x};\n                end\n                STATE_D: begin\n                    g <= 1'b1;\n                    if (y_counter < 2'b10)\n                        y_counter <= y_counter + 1;\n                end\n                STATE_E: begin\n                    g <= 1'b1;\n                end\n                STATE_F: begin\n                    g <= 1'b0;\n                end\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\n\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (resetn)\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                next_state = STATE_C;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                if (x_sequence == 2'b10 && x == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                if (y == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = STATE_E;\n                else if (y_counter == 2'b10)\n                    next_state = STATE_F;\n            end\n            STATE_E: begin\n                // Remain in STATE_E\n            end\n            STATE_F: begin\n                // Remain in STATE_F\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
