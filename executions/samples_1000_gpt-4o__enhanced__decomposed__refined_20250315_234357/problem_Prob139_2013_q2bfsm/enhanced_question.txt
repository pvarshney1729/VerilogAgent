- output logic g                  // Output signal controlling the motor

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
1. The FSM operates using a synchronous, active-low reset signal (`resetn`). The FSM remains in the initial state, "State A," as long as `resetn` is asserted (low).
2. Upon de-assertion of `resetn` (resetn becomes high), the FSM transitions from State A on the next positive edge of `clk` and sets the output `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.
3. The FSM then continuously monitors the input `x` for the sequence "1, 0, 1" over three successive clock cycles:
   - If `x` produces the sequence "1, 0, 1" on three successive positive clock edges, the output `g` is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.
4. When `g` is set to 1, the FSM monitors the input `y` for two consecutive clock cycles:
   - If `y` is 1 within these two clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently (until reset).
   - If `y` does not become 1 within these two clock cycles, `g` is set to 0 permanently (until reset).

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- All state transitions and outputs changes are synchronized to the positive edge of `clk`.
- `resetn` must be asserted (held low) to reset the FSM to State A and initialize all outputs to their default states.
- Upon reset de-assertion (resetn goes high), the FSM begins its functional behavior as specified.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset (resetn = 0), the FSM initializes to State A.
- Outputs `f` and `g` are initialized to 0 upon reset.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals are single bit, with `bit[0]` being the least significant bit.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM should correctly handle cases where `x` does not produce "1, 0, 1" in sequence or if `y` is not 1 in the specified monitoring period.
- The behavior specified assumes no glitches on the input signals `x` and `y` and that transitions occur strictly on clock edges.
