Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input  logic clk        // Clock input, positive edge triggered\n- input  logic areset     // Asynchronous reset input, active high\n- input  logic in         // State machine input, 1-bit\n- output logic out        // State machine output, 1-bit\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D. All sequential logic updates occur on the positive edge of the clock. The state machine has the following characteristics:\n\n1. Asynchronous Reset:\n   - The state machine is reset asynchronously to state A when 'areset' is asserted (high).\n   \n2. State Transitions and Output:\n   - The state transitions and output are defined as follows:\n     - State A: \n       - Next state is A if 'in' is 0, B if 'in' is 1.\n       - Output is 0.\n     - State B:\n       - Next state is C if 'in' is 0, B if 'in' is 1.\n       - Output is 0.\n     - State C:\n       - Next state is A if 'in' is 0, D if 'in' is 1.\n       - Output is 0.\n     - State D:\n       - Next state is C if 'in' is 0, B if 'in' is 1.\n       - Output is 1.\n\n3. Initial State:\n   - On power-up and reset, the state machine initializes to state A.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- The machine uses a one-hot encoding scheme for the states.\n- Inputs and outputs are single-bit signals. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the asynchronous reset is effective immediately without waiting for the clock edge.\n                    "

This is done using an enumerated type `state_t` for clarity and ease of use.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The next state is determined based on the current state and the input `in`. This logic is implemented using a combinational `always @(*)` block. Each state has specific transitions based on the input value, as defined in the state transition table.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The output of a Moore machine depends only on the current state. Therefore, we use another combinational `always @(*)` block to set the output `out` based on the current state.\n\n4. **State Register with Asynchronous Reset**: The state register holds the current state and updates it on the positive edge of the clock. An asynchronous reset is implemented to reset the state to `STATE_A` when `areset` is asserted. This is done using an `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block.\n\n5. **Adherence to Guidelines**: The code follows the provided guidelines and coding conventions, such as using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the asynchronous reset is handled correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specifications and behaves as expected.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ?

We have four states: A, B, C, and D, which we encode as 2-bit values.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: Implement the logic that determines the next state based on the current state and the input `in`. This is done using a combinational `always @(*)` block, which evaluates the next state based on the current state and input.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output is determined solely by the current state. We use another combinational `always @(*)` block to set the output `out` based on the current state.\n\n4. **State Register**: Implement a sequential `always` block that updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock or asynchronously resets it to state A when `areset` is asserted. This block ensures that the state transitions occur synchronously with the clock, while allowing for an asynchronous reset.\n\n5. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset logic is included in the state register block, ensuring that when `areset` is high, the state machine is immediately reset to state A, regardless of the clock.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the state machine behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output logic.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ?
