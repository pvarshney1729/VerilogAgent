To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The module will have a state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D. Each state has specific transitions based on the input `in`, and each state has a defined output. The state machine should reset asynchronously to state A when `areset` is asserted.

1. **State Encoding**: We use a 2-bit logic type to represent the four states. This allows us to easily manage state transitions and outputs.

2. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always @(*)` block to define the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block is combinational and determines the next state without waiting for a clock edge.

3. **Output Logic**: The output is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition. We use another `always @(*)` block to set the output based on the current state.

4. **State Register**: We use an `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block to update the current state. This block handles the asynchronous reset, which sets the state to A when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, avoiding explicit sensitivity lists in combinational blocks, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specified requirements and behaves correctly in simulation and synthesis.
