The implementation of the `TopModule` is based on a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to detect specific sequences in a serial bit stream. The FSM is designed to recognize three sequences: 
1. "0111110" which requires discarding a bit.
2. "01111110" which indicates a frame boundary (flag).
3. "01111111..." which signals an error due to 7 or more consecutive '1's.

The FSM uses a set of states to track the number of consecutive '1's received. The state transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the clock, and the reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with the clock. The outputs `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are asserted for one clock cycle after the respective sequence is detected.

The FSM starts in the `IDLE` state, which assumes the last input was '0'. As '1's are received, the FSM transitions through states `ONE_1` to `SIX_1`. If a '0' is received after `SIX_1`, the FSM transitions to `IDLE` and asserts `disc`. If a '1' is received after `SIX_1`, it transitions to `SEVEN_1`, asserts `flag`, and continues to assert `err` if more '1's are received.

The FSM is implemented using a combination of sequential logic for state transitions and combinational logic for determining the next state and outputs. The state encoding uses a 3-bit logic type to represent the different states.
