Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.
- input wire reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- input wire in: Single-bit serial data input stream.
- output reg disc: Output signal indicating a bit should be discarded.
- output reg flag: Output signal indicating the detection of a frame boundary.
- output reg err: Output signal indicating an error due to 7 or more consecutive '1's.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All single-bit inputs and outputs are treated as unsigned.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit in any multi-bit signal specification.

Behavioral Specification:
- Implement a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to decode the input bit stream.
- The FSM should have the following states to recognize specific sequences:
  1. Sequence "0111110": Output `disc` should be asserted for one clock cycle following detection.
  2. Sequence "01111110": Output `flag` should be asserted for one clock cycle following detection.
  3. Sequence "01111111..." (7 or more consecutive '1's): Output `err` should be asserted for one clock cycle following detection.

FSM Initial State and Reset Behavior:
- On an active-high synchronous reset, the FSM should transition to an initial state that assumes the last received input was '0'.
- The reset state ensures that the FSM is ready to process a new input sequence immediately after reset.

Clock and Timing:
- All sequential logic elements, including state transitions, are triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`.

Output Signal Assertion:
- The output signals `disc`, `flag`, and `err` should be asserted for exactly one clock cycle, starting from the cycle immediately after the respective condition is detected.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The FSM must correctly handle transitions between states, ensuring no race conditions or undefined behaviors.
- Ensure proper operation when input sequences are interrupted by resets or clock edges.

This specification aims to ensure a clear understanding and correct implementation of the HDLC framing logic within the TopModule.
