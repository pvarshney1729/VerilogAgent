<REASONING>
The implementation follows the specification of a Moore state machine with two states, A and B. The module is named `TopModule` and has the specified interface with inputs `clk`, `areset`, `in`, and output `out`. The state machine transitions between states based on the input `in` and outputs a value based on the current state.

1. **State Encoding**: Two states are defined using an enumerated type `state_t` with `STATE_A` encoded as `1'b0` and `STATE_B` as `1'b1`.

2. **State Register**: A state register `current_state` is used to hold the current state of the machine, and `next_state` is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input.

3. **Asynchronous Reset**: The state machine resets to `STATE_B` when `areset` is high, which is implemented in the first `always` block. This block is sensitive to both `clk` and `areset` to handle the asynchronous reset.

4. **State Transition Logic**: The second `always` block determines the `next_state` based on the current state and input `in`. The transitions are implemented as per the state diagram provided:
   - From `STATE_B`, transition to `STATE_A` on `in = 0`, stay in `STATE_B` on `in = 1`.
   - From `STATE_A`, transition to `STATE_B` on `in = 0`, stay in `STATE_A` on `in = 1`.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per Moore machine characteristics:
   - Output `0` in `STATE_A`.
   - Output `1` in `STATE_B`.

The code adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.
