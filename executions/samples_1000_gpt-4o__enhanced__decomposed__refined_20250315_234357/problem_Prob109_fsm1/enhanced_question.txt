Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal. (1-bit)
  - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal. (1-bit, active high)
  - `in`: Input signal to the state machine. (1-bit)

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: Output signal representing the current state output. (1-bit)

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore finite state machine with two states, A and B.
- State Encoding:
  - State A: Output `out` = 0
  - State B: Output `out` = 1

State Transition Logic:
- From State B:
  - On `in` = 0, transition to State A.
  - On `in` = 1, remain in State B.
- From State A:
  - On `in` = 0, transition to State B.
  - On `in` = 1, remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- The state machine shall asynchronously reset to State B when `areset` is asserted (high).

Additional Details:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- The reset signal `areset` is asynchronous and takes precedence over the clocked state transitions.
- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are 1-bit.
- Initial State: Upon reset, the state machine initializes to State B.
