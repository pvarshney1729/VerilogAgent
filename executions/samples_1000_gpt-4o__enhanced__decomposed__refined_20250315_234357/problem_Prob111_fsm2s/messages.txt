When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The state machine has two states: OFF and ON, with transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`. The reset is synchronous and active-high, setting the state to OFF.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define two states, OFF and ON, using local parameters. These are represented as single-bit logic values.\n\n2. **State Register**: We use a logic variable `state` to hold the current state and `next_state` for the next state logic.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: This is implemented in an always block triggered on the rising edge of `clk`. If `reset` is high, the state is set to OFF. Otherwise, the state transitions to `next_state`.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: This combinational logic determines `next_state` based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`. The transitions follow the specified state diagram.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, consistent with Moore machine behavior. This is implemented in a combinational always block.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, adhere to the synchronous reset specification, and use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.\n\nThe implementation follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring correct functionality and adherence to the specified interface.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    localparam logic OFF = 1'b0;\n    localparam logic ON  = 1'b1;\n\n    // State register\n    logic state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            state <= OFF;\n        end else begin\n            state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            OFF: next_state = (j) ?
