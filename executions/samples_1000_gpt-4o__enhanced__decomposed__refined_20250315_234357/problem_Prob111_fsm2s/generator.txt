<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The state machine has two states: OFF and ON, with transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`. The reset is synchronous and active-high, setting the state to OFF.

1. **State Encoding**: We define two states, OFF and ON, using local parameters. These are represented as single-bit logic values.

2. **State Register**: We use a logic variable `state` to hold the current state and `next_state` for the next state logic.

3. **State Transition Logic**: This is implemented in an always block triggered on the rising edge of `clk`. If `reset` is high, the state is set to OFF. Otherwise, the state transitions to `next_state`.

4. **Next State Logic**: This combinational logic determines `next_state` based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`. The transitions follow the specified state diagram.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, consistent with Moore machine behavior. This is implemented in a combinational always block.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, adhere to the synchronous reset specification, and use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.

The implementation follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring correct functionality and adherence to the specified interface.
