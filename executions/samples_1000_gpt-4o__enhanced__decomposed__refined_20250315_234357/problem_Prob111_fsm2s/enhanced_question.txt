Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: clk (1-bit, clock signal)
- Input: reset (1-bit, active-high synchronous reset)
- Input: j (1-bit, state transition input)
- Input: k (1-bit, state transition input)
- Output: out (1-bit, state indicator output)

State Machine Description:
- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- Each state is associated with an output value:
  - State OFF: out = 0
  - State ON: out = 1

State Transition Logic:
- From the OFF state (out=0):
  - If j=0, remain in the OFF state.
  - If j=1, transition to the ON state.
- From the ON state (out=1):
  - If k=0, remain in the ON state.
  - If k=1, transition to the OFF state.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is a synchronous, active-high reset.
- On reset (reset=1), the state transitions to the OFF state, and out is set to 0.
- Ensure all state registers are initialized to the OFF state upon reset.

Clocking:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.

Additional Clarifications:
- State transitions depend on the current state and the input values of j and k.
- The output, out, is determined solely by the current state and not directly by inputs j or k.
- Ensure no race conditions by adhering to the clock edge-triggered nature of the state transitions.

Signal Conventions:
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) in any multi-bit signal representation, though all signals here are 1-bit.
- Assume any unspecified conditions maintain current state and output.
