        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1 bit, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `in`: Serial data input, 1 bit.\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset, 1 bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out_byte`: Data byte output, 8 bits.\n  - `done`: Completion indicator, 1 bit.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process a serial data stream conforming to a protocol with the following structure:\n- Each transmission starts with a start bit ('0'), followed by 8 data bits, and ends with a stop bit ('1').\n- The line is idle at logic '1' when no data is transmitted.\n\nBehavior:\n1. The FSM identifies the start of a new byte by detecting a '0' on the `in` line.\n2. After detecting the start bit, the FSM sequentially captures the next 8 data bits, least significant bit first.\n3. The FSM expects a '1' as the stop bit immediately following the 8 data bits.\n4. Upon successful detection of the stop bit, the FSM:\n   - Asserts the `done` signal to indicate a complete byte has been received.\n   - Outputs the captured byte on `out_byte`. The `out_byte` is valid only when `done` is '1'; otherwise, it is considered a don't-care value.\n5. If the stop bit is not detected correctly, the FSM waits for the next valid stop bit before restarting the byte reception process.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The `reset` input, when asserted high, synchronously resets the FSM to its initial idle state. All internal registers and outputs are reset to their default states. `out_byte` is undefined, and `done` is '0' during reset.\n\nConcurrency:\n- All sequential logic operations are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM only processes data when the start bit is correctly identified. Any deviation in the expected bit pattern will result in the FSM waiting for the next valid start bit.\n- The `out_byte` and `done` signals are updated only upon the successful detection of a complete byte with a valid stop bit.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- `out_byte[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) of the data byte.\n\nThe design ensures robustness against incomplete byte sequences by strictly adhering to the serial protocol structure.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the TopModule, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a serial data stream according to the specified protocol. The FSM will have the following states:\n\n1. **IDLE**: The FSM waits for a start bit ('0') to begin receiving a new byte. The line is idle at logic '1'.\n\n2. **START**: Once a start bit is detected, the FSM transitions to this state to prepare for data reception.\n\n3. **DATA**: In this state, the FSM collects 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit (LSB) first. A bit counter is used to track the number of bits received.\n\n4. **STOP**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM expects a stop bit ('1'). If the stop bit is correct, the FSM transitions to the DONE state; otherwise, it returns to IDLE to wait for the next valid start bit.\n\n5. **DONE**: The FSM asserts the `done` signal to indicate a complete byte has been received and outputs the collected byte on `out_byte`. It then returns to IDLE.\n\nThe FSM is implemented using a synchronous reset, which resets the FSM to the IDLE state and clears the outputs. The state transitions are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.\n\nThe module uses a combination of sequential logic (for state transitions and data collection) and combinational logic (for next state determination). The `always_ff` block handles the sequential logic, while the `always_comb` block handles the combinational logic for state transitions.\n\nThe implementation adheres to the specified interface and coding conventions, ensuring correct operation and robustness against incomplete byte sequences.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic in,\n    input logic reset,\n    output logic [7:0] out_byte,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE  = 3'b000,\n        START = 3'b001,\n        DATA  = 3'b010,\n        STOP  = 3'b011,\n        DONE  = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] bit_count;\n    logic [7:0] data_buffer;\n\n    // State transition and output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            bit_count <= 3'b000;\n            data_buffer <= 8'b00000000;\n            out_byte <= 8'b00000000;\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == DATA) begin\n                data_buffer <= {in, data_buffer[7:1]};\n                bit_count <= bit_count + 1;\n            end else if (current_state == DONE) begin\n                out_byte <= data_buffer;\n                done <= 1'b1;\n            end else begin\n                done <= 1'b0;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state; // Default to hold state\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in == 1'b0) // Start bit detected\n                    next_state = START;\n            end\n            START: begin\n                next_state = DATA;\n            end\n            DATA: begin\n                if (bit_count == 3'b111) // All 8 data bits received\n                    next_state = STOP;\n            end\n            STOP: begin\n                if (in == 1'b1) // Stop bit detected\n                    next_state = DONE;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE; // Error, wait for next start bit\n            end\n            DONE: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            default: next_state = IDLE;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
