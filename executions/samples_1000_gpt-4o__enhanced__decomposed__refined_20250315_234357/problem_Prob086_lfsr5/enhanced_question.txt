Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the rising edge of this signal.
  - `reset`: 1-bit input for the active-high synchronous reset signal.

- Outputs:
  - `q`: 5-bit output representing the current state of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).

Behavioral Description:
- The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- The LFSR shifts its current state to the right by one bit position on every rising edge of `clk`.
- Tap positions are defined at bit indices 4 and 2 (zero-based indexing, where bit[0] is the least significant bit).
- During each clock cycle, the next state of the LFSR is determined as follows:
  - The new bit for `q[4]` is the XOR of the current `q[0]` (least significant bit) and the current `q[4]` and `q[2]` bit values.
  - Bits `q[3]`, `q[2]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]` shift right and take the value of the bit to their left.

Reset Conditions:
- On the assertion of the `reset` signal, the LFSR output `q` is synchronously set to binary `00001`, ensuring it does not enter a zero state.

Operational Characteristics:
- The LFSR is designed to be maximal-length, cycling through 31 states (2^5 - 1) before repeating, not including the all-zero state.

Note:
- Ensure that the implementation avoids reaching the all-zero state by proper initialization and maintaining the reset logic.
- The LFSR should operate continuously as long as the `reset` is not asserted.
