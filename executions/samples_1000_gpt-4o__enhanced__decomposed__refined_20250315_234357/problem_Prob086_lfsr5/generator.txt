<REASONING>
To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with inputs `clk` and `reset`, and a 5-bit output `q`.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the LFSR to the initial state `5'b00001` when `reset` is high. This ensures the LFSR does not enter the all-zero state.

3. **LFSR Logic**: On each positive edge of the clock, the LFSR shifts its bits to the right. The new bit for `q[4]` is calculated using the XOR of the current `q[4]` and `q[2]` with the least significant bit `q[0]`. This implements the feedback logic for the Galois LFSR.

4. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always_ff` block triggered by the positive edge of `clk` to ensure all operations are synchronous with the clock.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, adhere to the specified interface, and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, the implementation meets the requirements for a maximal-length LFSR with the specified tap positions and synchronous reset behavior.
