Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specifications:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the rising edge of this signal.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit input for the active-high synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `q`: 5-bit output representing the current state of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n\nBehavioral Description:\n- The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- The LFSR shifts its current state to the right by one bit position on every rising edge of `clk`.\n- Tap positions are defined at bit indices 4 and 2 (zero-based indexing, where bit[0] is the least significant bit).\n- During each clock cycle, the next state of the LFSR is determined as follows:\n  - The new bit for `q[4]` is the XOR of the current `q[0]` (least significant bit) and the current `q[4]` and `q[2]` bit values.\n  - Bits `q[3]`, `q[2]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]` shift right and take the value of the bit to their left.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- On the assertion of the `reset` signal, the LFSR output `q` is synchronously set to binary `00001`, ensuring it does not enter a zero state.\n\nOperational Characteristics:\n- The LFSR is designed to be maximal-length, cycling through 31 states (2^5 - 1) before repeating, not including the all-zero state.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure that the implementation avoids reaching the all-zero state by proper initialization and maintaining the reset logic.\n- The LFSR should operate continuously as long as the `reset` is not asserted.\n                    "
