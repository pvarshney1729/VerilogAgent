Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.\n  - reset: 1-bit, active high signal to reset the state machine synchronously.\n  - in: 8-bit wide input, where bit[0] is the least significant bit and bit[7] is the most significant bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - done: 1-bit, signal indicating the completion of receiving a full 3-byte message.\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n- The module shall implement a finite state machine (FSM) to delineate message boundaries within a continuous byte stream following the PS/2 mouse protocol.\n  \n- Message Detection:\n  - Each message consists of exactly three bytes.\n  - The first byte of each message has the condition in[3] = 1.\n  - Bytes two and three have no restrictions on in[3].\n\n- FSM Operation:\n  - The FSM will discard all incoming bytes until it detects a byte where in[3] = 1. This byte is assumed to be the first byte of a new message.\n  - Upon detection of the first byte, the FSM will continue to process the next two bytes as part of the current message.\n  - After the third byte of the message is successfully received, the FSM shall assert the 'done' signal for one clock cycle in the cycle immediately following the receipt of the third byte.\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - The reset signal is active high and synchronous with the clock.\n  - Upon assertion of the reset signal, the FSM shall return to its initial state, ready to detect the start of a new message.\n\n- Clocking:\n  - All sequential elements, including state registers, are triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n\n- Initial State:\n  - On system initialization or reset, the FSM shall be in a state ready to detect the start of a new message.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The FSM must correctly handle cases where multiple consecutive bytes meet the in[3] = 1 condition, ensuring proper message alignment.\n- In the event of a reset during message reception, the partially received message should be discarded, and the FSM should resume searching for a new message start.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a finite state machine (FSM) approach to detect message boundaries in a PS/2 mouse protocol byte stream. The FSM has four states: IDLE, BYTE1, BYTE2, and BYTE3. The IDLE state waits for a byte with `in[3] = 1`, indicating the start of a new message. Upon detecting such a byte, the FSM transitions to BYTE1, then sequentially to BYTE2 and BYTE3, representing the receipt of the first, second, and third bytes of the message, respectively. After receiving the third byte, the FSM transitions back to IDLE and asserts the `done` signal for one clock cycle, indicating the successful receipt of a complete message. The FSM is reset synchronously with the clock, returning to the IDLE state when the `reset` signal is high.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic [7:0] in,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        IDLE  = 2'b00,\n        BYTE1 = 2'b01,\n        BYTE2 = 2'b10,\n        BYTE3 = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in[3] == 1'b1) begin\n                    next_state = BYTE1;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n                end\n            end\n            BYTE1: begin\n                next_state = BYTE2;\n            end\n            BYTE2: begin\n                next_state = BYTE3;\n            end\n            BYTE3: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            default: begin\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end else if (current_state == BYTE3) begin\n            done <= 1'b1;\n        end else begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The only indication is that the first byte of each three\nbyte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be\n1 or 0 depending on data).\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine that will search for\nmessage boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll\nuse is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume\nthat this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message\nonce all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in\nthe cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was\nsuccessfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.
