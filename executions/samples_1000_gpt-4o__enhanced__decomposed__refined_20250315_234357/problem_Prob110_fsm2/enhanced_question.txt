<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, `TopModule`, is to be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input clk`: Clock signal used for synchronizing sequential logic.
- `input areset`: Asynchronous reset input, active high. When high, it resets the state machine to the initial state `OFF`.
- `input j`: Input signal to transition from state `OFF` to `ON`.
- `input k`: Input signal to transition from state `ON` to `OFF`.
- `output reg out`: Output signal representing the state of the machine, where `0` corresponds to the `OFF` state and `1` corresponds to the `ON` state.

The state machine is a Moore type with two states:

1. `OFF` state, where `out = 0`.
2. `ON` state, where `out = 1`.

State transitions are defined as follows:

- From `OFF` state (`out = 0`):
  - If `j = 0`, remain in `OFF` state.
  - If `j = 1`, transition to `ON` state.

- From `ON` state (`out = 1`):
  - If `k = 0`, remain in `ON` state.
  - If `k = 1`, transition to `OFF` state.

Reset Behavior:

- The reset is asynchronous and active high. When `areset` is set to `1`, the state machine immediately transitions to the `OFF` state, regardless of the clock signal or any other inputs.
- When `areset` is `0`, the state machine operates based on the clock signal and the inputs `j` and `k`.

Clock and Timing:

- All state transitions are synchronized with the rising edge of the `clk` signal, except for the asynchronous reset condition.

Initial Condition:

- Upon initialization, or when `areset` is high, the state machine should be in the `OFF` state, with `out` set to `0`.

Bit Indexing:

- The port `out` is a single bit, where its value directly reflects the current state of the machine (`0` for `OFF`, `1` for `ON`).

This specification ensures the correct implementation of a two-state Moore machine with defined behavior for inputs and resets.
