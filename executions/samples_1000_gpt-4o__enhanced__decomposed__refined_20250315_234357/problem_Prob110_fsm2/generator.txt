To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to follow the given state transition diagram and ensure that the asynchronous reset is handled correctly. The module has two states: `OFF` and `ON`, with transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, making it a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: We define two states, `OFF` and `ON`, using a single-bit logic type. This is efficient since we only have two states.

2. **State Register**: We use a state register to hold the current state. This register is updated on the rising edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset (`areset`) is active.

3. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented to set the state to `OFF` when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock. This is achieved by including `areset` in the sensitivity list of the sequential always block.

4. **Next State Logic**: We use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`. The transitions are defined as per the state diagram.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. In the `OFF` state, `out` is `0`, and in the `ON` state, `out` is `1`.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_comb` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module behaves as specified and adheres to the given guidelines and conventions.
