<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is designed to implement a Moore state machine with two states, A and B, as specified. The state machine transitions between states based on the input `in`, and the output `out` is determined solely by the current state.

1. **State Encoding**: Two states are defined using local parameters `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`. These are encoded as single-bit values.

2. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block ensures that the state transitions are combinational and follow the specified transitions:
   - From state B, transition to A if `in` is 0, otherwise stay in B.
   - From state A, transition to B if `in` is 0, otherwise stay in A.

3. **Sequential Logic for State Update**: An `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to update the current state on the rising edge of the clock. The synchronous reset is implemented by checking if `reset` is high, in which case the state is set to `STATE_B`.

4. **Output Logic**: Another `always @(*)` block is used to determine the output `out` based on the current state. The output is 1 in state B and 0 in state A, as specified.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset is synchronous by not including it in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.

This implementation ensures that the state machine behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output logic.
