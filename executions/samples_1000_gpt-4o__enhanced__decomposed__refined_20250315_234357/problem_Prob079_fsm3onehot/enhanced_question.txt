Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in;` // 1-bit input signal
  - `input wire [3:0] state;` // 4-bit state input representing one-hot encoding of states A, B, C, D
- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [3:0] next_state;` // 4-bit output for the next state, one-hot encoded
  - `output reg out;` // 1-bit output signal

Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with the following configuration:
  - States: A, B, C, D, encoded in one-hot format as follows:
    - State A: 4'b0001
    - State B: 4'b0010
    - State C: 4'b0100
    - State D: 4'b1000
  - The state machine transitions based on the input `in` and current `state`.
  - It is purely combinational logic; there is no clock or reset signal involved.
  - State transitions and outputs are determined as follows:

State Transition Table:
- Current State: A
  - Next state if `in = 0`: A
  - Next state if `in = 1`: B
  - Output: 0
- Current State: B
  - Next state if `in = 0`: C
  - Next state if `in = 1`: B
  - Output: 0
- Current State: C
  - Next state if `in = 0`: A
  - Next state if `in = 1`: D
  - Output: 0
- Current State: D
  - Next state if `in = 0`: C
  - Next state if `in = 1`: B
  - Output: 1

Notes:
- The MSB is bit[3] and the LSB is bit[0] in the `state` and `next_state` vectors.
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, reflecting the Moore machine characteristic.
- Ensure that all transitions and outputs are derived based on the inspection of the state transition table provided above.
