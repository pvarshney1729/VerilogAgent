Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - input logic d; // 1 bit, data input
  - input logic done_counting; // 1 bit, indicates counting completion
  - input logic ack; // 1 bit, acknowledge signal
  - input logic [9:0] state; // 10-bit one-hot encoded state input
- Outputs:
  - output logic B3_next; // 1 bit, asserts when the next state is B3
  - output logic S_next; // 1 bit, asserts when the next state is S
  - output logic S1_next; // 1 bit, asserts when the next state is S1
  - output logic Count_next; // 1 bit, asserts when the next state is Count
  - output logic Wait_next; // 1 bit, asserts when the next state is Wait
  - output logic done; // 1 bit, output signal
  - output logic counting; // 1 bit, output signal
  - output logic shift_ena; // 1 bit, output signal

State Encoding and Transition:
- States are encoded using one-hot encoding:
  - S: 10'b0000000001
  - S1: 10'b0000000010
  - S11: 10'b0000000100
  - S110: 10'b0000001000
  - B0: 10'b0000010000
  - B1: 10'b0000100000
  - B2: 10'b0001000000
  - B3: 10'b0010000000
  - Count: 10'b0100000000
  - Wait: 10'b1000000000

- Initial State: The state machine starts in state "S" upon reset.

State Transition Logic:
- S: Transition to S on d=0; transition to S1 on d=1.
- S1: Transition to S on d=0; transition to S11 on d=1.
- S11: Transition to S110 on d=0; remain in S11 on d=1.
- S110: Transition to S on d=0; transition to B0 on d=1.
- B0: Always transition to B1 in the next cycle.
- B1: Always transition to B2 in the next cycle.
- B2: Always transition to B3 in the next cycle.
- B3: Always transition to Count in the next cycle.
- Count: Remain in Count if done_counting=0; transition to Wait if done_counting=1.
- Wait: Remain in Wait if ack=0; transition to S if ack=1.

Output Logic:
- B3_next: Asserted when the next state is B3.
- S_next: Asserted when the next state is S.
- S1_next: Asserted when the next state is S1.
- Count_next: Asserted when the next state is Count.
- Wait_next: Asserted when the next state is Wait.
- done: Asserted when the current state is Wait.
- counting: Asserted when the current state is Count.
- shift_ena: Asserted when the current state is one of B0, B1, B2, or B3.

Reset Behavior:
- Asynchronous reset to the initial state "S" is assumed.
- All outputs default to 0 unless explicitly asserted as per state transition and output logic.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that only valid one-hot states are present on state input.
- If an invalid state is detected, behavior is undefined.
