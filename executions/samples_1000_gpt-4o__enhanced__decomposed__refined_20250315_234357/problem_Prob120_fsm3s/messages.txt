The module will have a synchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A. The state machine has four states (A, B, C, D) and transitions based on the input `in`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the four states using 2-bit binary encoding.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always_ff` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to update the current state. The reset logic is included to set the state to A when reset is high.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: An `always_comb` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block uses a `case` statement to handle all possible states and transitions.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: Another `always_comb` block is used to set the output `out` based on the current state. The output is 1 only in state D, and 0 in all other states.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_comb` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset is synchronous by not including it in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure the module meets the specification and adheres to the provided guidelines and coding conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // Synchronous state transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A; // Reset to state A\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in) ?

This makes the state transitions clear and manageable.\n\n2. **Synchronous Reset Logic**: I implemented a synchronous reset by checking the `reset` signal within the `always_ff` block triggered by the positive edge of the `clk`. If `reset` is high, the FSM transitions to `STATE_A`.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: I used an `always_comb` block to define the next state logic based on the current state and input `in`. The transitions follow the provided state transition table.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: I implemented the output logic in a separate `always_comb` block. Since it's a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. The output is `1` only in `STATE_D` and `0` otherwise.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: I adhered to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and `always_comb` for combinational logic without explicitly specifying sensitivity lists.\n\n6. **Safety**: I included a default case in the state transition logic to ensure the FSM defaults to `STATE_A` in case of any undefined state, providing robustness against unexpected conditions.\n\nThis approach ensures a clear, maintainable, and correct implementation of the specified Moore state machine.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // Synchronous state transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A; // Reset to state A\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the TopModule follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is designed to implement a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D. The state transitions are based on the input signal 'in' and are defined in the state transition table. The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state, which is characteristic of a Moore machine.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit logic type, allowing for four distinct states. This is done using a typedef enum for clarity and maintainability.\n\n2. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is synchronous, meaning the reset condition is checked on the positive edge of the clock. When reset is high, the FSM transitions to state A.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: The next state is determined based on the current state and the input 'in'. This logic is implemented using an always_comb block, which automatically infers the sensitivity list.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output 'out' is set based on the current state. In state D, the output is 1; in all other states, it is 0.
