Module Specification: TopModule

- Module Name: TopModule
- Port List:
  - Input: 
    - clk (1-bit): Clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.
    - reset (1-bit): Synchronous active high reset, resets FSM to initial state A.
    - in (1-bit): Input signal for state transitions.
  - Output:
    - out (1-bit): Output signal based on the current state.

- State Machine Description:
  - Type: Moore state machine
  - States: Four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.
  - Initial State: State A upon reset.
  - Clock Edge: All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.
  - State Transition Table:

    | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
    |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
    | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |
    | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |
    | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |
    | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |

- Reset Behavior:
  - Reset Type: Synchronous active high.
  - On reset, the FSM transitions to State A and the output 'out' is set to 0.

- Signal Details:
  - All ports are 1-bit wide and unsigned.
  - The output 'out' value is dependent solely on the current state, not the input 'in'.

- Implementation Notes:
  - Ensure all flip-flops and registers are initialized correctly as per the reset behavior.
  - No undefined states or state transitions; handle all possible input combinations.
  - Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are single bit.

- Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
  - Ensure correct transitions and output behavior across all state boundaries and input conditions.
  - Check for race conditions or glitches in state transitions and output signaling.
