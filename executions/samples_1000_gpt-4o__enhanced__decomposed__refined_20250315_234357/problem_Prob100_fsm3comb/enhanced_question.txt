Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in`: A 1-bit input signal representing the current input condition.
  - `input wire [1:0] state`: A 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [1:0] next_state`: A 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the MSB.
  - `output reg out`: A 1-bit output signal representing the output of the state machine.

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- Number of States: 4
- State Encoding:
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

State Transition and Output Logic:
- The logic is combinational, and the next_state and out are computed based on the current state and input `in` as per the state transition table below:

  | Current State (state) | Next State if `in=0` | Next State if `in=1` | Output (out) |
  |-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
  | A (2'b00)             | A (2'b00)            | B (2'b01)            | 0            |
  | B (2'b01)             | C (2'b10)            | B (2'b01)            | 0            |
  | C (2'b10)             | A (2'b00)            | D (2'b11)            | 0            |
  | D (2'b11)             | C (2'b10)            | B (2'b01)            | 1            |

Initial Conditions and Edge Cases:
- The specification assumes that valid state encodings are provided at all times.
- The design does not include explicit reset logic; therefore, initial conditions for state registers are not defined in this specification.
- The module is expected to handle all specified input conditions without undefined behavior.

Note: Ensure that the combinational logic for determining `next_state` and `out` is implemented without introducing race conditions. The design must be free from latches and should operate solely based on the provided state transition table.
