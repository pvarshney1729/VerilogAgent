<REASONING>
To implement the FSM as specified, we need to define a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The FSM has six states (A, B, C, D, E, F) with specific transitions based on the input `w`. The output `z` is determined by the current state. We use a 3-bit encoding for the states to represent them uniquely. The FSM should reset to state A on a synchronous active-high reset. We use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and the state flip-flops, and another always block for the output logic. The state transition logic is implemented using a case statement that determines the next state based on the current state and input `w`. The output logic is also implemented using a case statement to set `z` based on the current state.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    input logic w,
    output logic z
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        A = 3'b000,
        B = 3'b001,
        C = 3'b010,
        D = 3'b011,
        E = 3'b100,
        F = 3'b101
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State flip-flops
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= A;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // State transition logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            A: next_state = (w) ? B : A;
