        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and should adhere to the following interface, where all input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input logic clk` : Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.\n- `input logic reset` : Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n- `input logic w` : Input signal to determine state transitions.\n- `output logic z` : Output signal determined by the current state.\n\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with six states, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:\n\n- State A: \n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state B.\n  - On input `w = 0`, remain in state A.\n  - Output `z = 0`.\n\n- State B:\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state C.\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.\n  - Output `z = 0`.\n\n- State C:\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state E.\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.\n  - Output `z = 0`.\n\n- State D:\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state F.\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state A.\n  - Output `z = 0`.\n\n- State E:\n  - On input `w = 1`, remain in state E.\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.\n  - Output `z = 1`.\n\n- State F:\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state C.\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.\n  - Output `z = 1`.\n\nThe FSM should reset into state A when the `reset` signal is asserted high. This reset is synchronous and occurs on the positive edge of the clock. All state transitions and the output `z` are evaluated on the positive edge of the clock.\n\nState encoding can be defined as follows (using a 3-bit encoding for simplicity, though other encodings are permissible):\n\n- A = 3'b000\n- B = 3'b001\n- C = 3'b010\n- D = 3'b011\n- E = 3'b100\n- F = 3'b101\n\nUse separate always blocks for the state transition logic and the state registers. The output `z` can be described using either continuous assignment or an additional always block, depending on implementation preference.\n\nEnsure all registers are initialized to a known state. On reset, each state register should be explicitly set to the encoding for state A.\n\nEdge cases and potential race conditions should be carefully considered, ensuring that the FSM remains stable and functions correctly under all valid input conditions.\n                    "

The module is designed to implement a finite state machine (FSM) with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Each state is assigned a unique 3-bit code.\n\n2. **State Flip-Flops**: The state flip-flops are implemented using an `always_ff` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset is handled within this block, ensuring that the FSM resets to state A when the reset signal is high.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: The state transition logic is implemented using an `always @(*)` block. This block determines the next state based on the current state and the input `w`. The transitions are defined according to the state diagram provided in the specification.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined using another `always @(*)` block. The output is set to `1` when the FSM is in states E or F, and `0` otherwise.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nOverall, the implementation is structured to be clear, maintainable, and in compliance with the given specifications and guidelines.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        A = 3'b000,\n        B = 3'b001,\n        C = 3'b010,\n        D = 3'b011,\n        E = 3'b100,\n        F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State flip-flops\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset)\n            current_state <= A;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            A: next_state = (w) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and specifications provided. The module is designed to implement a finite state machine (FSM) with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each state is encoded using a 3-bit value, allowing for straightforward state transitions and output logic.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a `typedef` enumeration, which provides clear and readable state names. Each state is assigned a unique 3-bit binary code.\n\n2. **State Flip-Flops**: The state flip-flops are implemented using an `always_ff` block, which updates the `current_state` on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset is handled within this block, ensuring that the FSM resets to state A when the reset signal is high.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: The state transition logic is implemented in a separate `always` block. This block uses a `case` statement to determine the `next_state` based on the `current_state` and input `w`. The transitions are defined according to the provided state diagram.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined by the current state. An `always` block is used to set `z` to 1 when the FSM is in states E or F, and 0 otherwise. This logic is straightforward and directly follows the state diagram's output specifications.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always @(*)` for combinational logic. The synchronous reset is correctly implemented without including `reset` in the sensitivity list of sequential blocks.\n\nOverall, the implementation is modular, clear, and adheres to the given specifications and guidelines.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        A = 3'b000,\n        B = 3'b001,\n        C = 3'b010,\n        D = 3'b011,\n        E = 3'b100,\n        F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State flip-flops\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset)\n            current_state <= A;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            A: next_state = (w) ?
