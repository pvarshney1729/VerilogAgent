<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and should adhere to the following interface, where all input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input logic clk` : Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.
- `input logic reset` : Synchronous active-high reset signal.
- `input logic w` : Input signal to determine state transitions.
- `output logic z` : Output signal determined by the current state.

The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with six states, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:

- State A: 
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state B.
  - On input `w = 0`, remain in state A.
  - Output `z = 0`.

- State B:
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state C.
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.
  - Output `z = 0`.

- State C:
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state E.
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.
  - Output `z = 0`.

- State D:
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state F.
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state A.
  - Output `z = 0`.

- State E:
  - On input `w = 1`, remain in state E.
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.
  - Output `z = 1`.

- State F:
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state C.
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state D.
  - Output `z = 1`.

The FSM should reset into state A when the `reset` signal is asserted high. This reset is synchronous and occurs on the positive edge of the clock. All state transitions and the output `z` are evaluated on the positive edge of the clock.

State encoding can be defined as follows (using a 3-bit encoding for simplicity, though other encodings are permissible):

- A = 3'b000
- B = 3'b001
- C = 3'b010
- D = 3'b011
- E = 3'b100
- F = 3'b101

Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and the state registers. The output `z` can be described using either continuous assignment or an additional always block, depending on implementation preference.

Ensure all registers are initialized to a known state. On reset, each state register should be explicitly set to the encoding for state A.

Edge cases and potential race conditions should be carefully considered, ensuring that the FSM remains stable and functions correctly under all valid input conditions.
