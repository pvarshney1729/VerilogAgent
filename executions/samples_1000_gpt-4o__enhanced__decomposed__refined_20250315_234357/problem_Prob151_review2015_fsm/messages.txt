        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input logic clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input logic reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n  - `input logic data`: Serial data input.\n  - `input logic done_counting`: Signal indicating counters have finished counting.\n  - `input logic ack`: Acknowledgement signal from the user.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output logic shift_ena`: Enable signal for shifting data, asserted for 4 clock cycles.\n  - `output logic counting`: Indicates the state machine is in the counting phase.\n  - `output logic done`: Notifies the user that the timer has completed.\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. **Pattern Detection**: The state machine starts in an idle state where it continuously monitors the `data` input for the binary pattern `1101`. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n   \n2. **Shift Enable**: Upon detection of the `1101` pattern, the state machine asserts the `shift_ena` output for precisely 4 consecutive clock cycles. During this period, additional 4 bits are shifted in to determine the delay duration (handled outside this FSM).\n\n3. **Counting Phase**: After the 4-cycle shift, the state machine asserts `counting` to indicate it is waiting for the external counters to finish. It remains in this state until `done_counting` is asserted high.\n\n4. **Completion Notification**: Once `done_counting` is high, the state machine transitions to assert the `done` output, notifying the user that the timer has completed. The state machine then waits for `ack` to be asserted high.\n\n5. **Reset and Restart**: Upon receiving `ack`, or if `reset` is high, the state machine returns to its initial state where it monitors for the `1101` pattern again.\n\nState Machine Characteristics:\n- Synchronous Reset: The `reset` input is synchronous and active high. When asserted, it initializes the state machine to the pattern detection state.\n- Clock: All state transitions and sequential logic are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.\n- Initial State: On reset, the state machine initializes to the state where it searches for the `1101` pattern.\n- Edge Cases: The state machine is robust against erroneous patterns and resets appropriately when `reset` is asserted.\n\nNote: This specification details only the control logic (FSM) for the timer. The datapath components such as counters and comparators are external to this FSM and are not described here.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to create a finite-state machine (FSM) that meets the specified requirements. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the different states of the FSM. The states include `IDLE`, `DETECT_1`, `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`, `DETECT_1101`, `SHIFT`, `COUNT`, and `DONE`. Each state corresponds to a specific part of the pattern detection and timer process.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The `always_ff` block handles state transitions on the positive edge of the clock. It also includes a synchronous reset that sets the FSM to the `IDLE` state and initializes the `shift_counter` to zero.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: The `always_comb` block determines the next state based on the current state and input conditions. It also sets the output signals (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) based on the current state.\n\n   - **Pattern Detection**: The FSM transitions through states `IDLE`, `DETECT_1`, `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`, and `DETECT_1101` as it detects the pattern `1101` on the `data` input.\n   \n   - **Shift Enable**: Upon detecting the pattern `1101`, the FSM enters the `SHIFT` state, asserting `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles (controlled by `shift_counter`).\n\n   - **Counting Phase**: After shifting, the FSM enters the `COUNT` state, asserting `counting` until `done_counting` is high.\n\n   - **Completion Notification**: Once `done_counting` is high, the FSM transitions to the `DONE` state, asserting `done` to notify the user. It waits for `ack` to return to the `IDLE` state.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output signals are controlled based on the current state. `shift_ena` is asserted during the `SHIFT` state, `counting` during the `COUNT` state, and `done` during the `DONE` state.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic ensures that the FSM starts in the `IDLE` state and the `shift_counter` is reset to zero when `reset` is high.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring correct functionality and readability.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    output logic shift_ena,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE        = 3'b000,\n        DETECT_1    = 3'b001,\n        DETECT_11   = 3'b010,\n        DETECT_110  = 3'b011,\n        DETECT_1101 = 3'b100,\n        SHIFT       = 3'b101,\n        COUNT       = 3'b110,\n        DONE        = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] shift_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == SHIFT) begin\n                shift_counter <= shift_counter + 1;\n            end else begin\n                shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        // Default assignments\n        next_state = current_state;\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1;\n            end\n            DETECT_1: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_11;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_11: begin\n                if (!data) next_state = DETECT_110;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_110: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1101;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_1101: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                next_state = SHIFT;\n            end\n            SHIFT: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                if (shift_counter == 3'b011) begin\n                    next_state = COUNT;\n                end\n            end\n            COUNT: begin\n                counting = 1'b1;\n                if (done_counting) next_state = DONE;\n            end\n            DONE: begin\n                done = 1'b1;\n                if (ack) next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to create a finite-state machine (FSM) that adheres to the given specification. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM is designed with eight states, each representing a specific phase in the pattern detection and timer operation. The states are encoded using a 3-bit logic vector, allowing for up to eight unique states.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input signals (`data`, `done_counting`, `ack`) and the current state. The transitions are defined in an `always_ff` block, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. This ensures synchronous operation with the clock signal.\n\n3. **Pattern Detection**: The FSM begins in the `IDLE` state, monitoring the `data` input for the pattern `1101`. It transitions through intermediate states (`DETECT_1`, `DETECT_11`, `DETECT_110`) as each bit of the pattern is detected.\n\n4. **Shift Enable**: Upon detecting the complete pattern `1101`, the FSM transitions to the `SHIFT` state, asserting the `shift_ena` output for exactly 4 clock cycles. This is achieved using a `shift_counter` that increments each cycle while in the `SHIFT` state.\n\n5. **Counting Phase**: After the shift operation, the FSM enters the `COUNT` state, asserting the `counting` output. It remains in this state until the `done_counting` signal is asserted, indicating that the external counters have finished.\n\n6. **Completion Notification**: Once counting is complete, the FSM transitions to the `DONE` state, asserting the `done` output to notify the user. It waits in this state until the `ack` signal is received, indicating user acknowledgment.\n\n7. **Reset and Restart**: The FSM includes a synchronous reset mechanism, which initializes the state to `IDLE` and resets the `shift_counter`. This ensures that the FSM can restart the pattern detection process upon reset or after acknowledgment.\n\n8. **Output Logic**: The outputs (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) are controlled within the `always_comb` block, ensuring they are updated based on the current state and input conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, the FSM effectively implements the timer control logic as specified, ensuring correct operation and synchronization with the clock signal.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    output logic shift_ena,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE        = 3'b000,\n        DETECT_1    = 3'b001,\n        DETECT_11   = 3'b010,\n        DETECT_110  = 3'b011,\n        DETECT_1101 = 3'b100,\n        SHIFT       = 3'b101,\n        COUNT       = 3'b110,\n        DONE        = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] shift_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == SHIFT) begin\n                shift_counter <= shift_counter + 1;\n            end else begin\n                shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        // Default assignments\n        next_state = current_state;\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1;\n            end\n            DETECT_1: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_11;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_11: begin\n                if (!data) next_state = DETECT_110;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_110: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1101;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_1101: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                next_state = SHIFT;\n            end\n            SHIFT: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                if (shift_counter == 3'b011) begin\n                    next_state = COUNT;\n                end\n            end\n            COUNT: begin\n                counting = 1'b1;\n                if (done_counting) next_state = DONE;\n            end\n            DONE: begin\n                done = 1'b1;\n                if (ack) next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included\nhere.\n\nThe serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101\nis received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for\nexactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its\ncounting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits\nuntil input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must\nassert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until\ninput ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the\nstart sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high\nsynchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the\ninput sequence 1101.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification by creating a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects a specific pattern (`1101`) on the `data` input and then performs a series of actions based on the detected pattern. The FSM is implemented using a set of states encoded as a 3-bit value. The states are:\n\n1. **IDLE**: The initial state where the FSM waits for the first `1` of the pattern.\n2. **DETECT_1**: The state after detecting the first `1`.\n3. **DETECT_11**: The state after detecting the second `1`.\n4. **DETECT_110**: The state after detecting `110`.\n5. **DETECT_1101**: The state after detecting the complete pattern `1101`. This state triggers the `shift_ena` signal.\n6. **SHIFT**: The state where `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles to shift in additional bits.\n7. **COUNT**: The state where the FSM waits for the `done_counting` signal, indicating the counting process is complete.\n8. **DONE**: The state where the `done` signal is asserted to notify the user. The FSM waits for the `ack` signal to return to the IDLE state.\n\nThe FSM transitions between these states based on the input signals and the current state. The `shift_counter` is used to ensure that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles. The synchronous reset logic ensures that the FSM returns to the IDLE state when `reset` is asserted.\n\nThe implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic. The FSM is designed to be robust and handle all specified conditions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    output logic shift_ena,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE        = 3'b000,\n        DETECT_1    = 3'b001,\n        DETECT_11   = 3'b010,\n        DETECT_110  = 3'b011,\n        DETECT_1101 = 3'b100,\n        SHIFT       = 3'b101,\n        COUNT       = 3'b110,\n        DONE        = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] shift_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == SHIFT) begin\n                shift_counter <= shift_counter + 1;\n            end else begin\n                shift_counter <= 3'b000;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        // Default assignments\n        next_state = current_state;\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1;\n            end\n            DETECT_1: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_11;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_11: begin\n                if (!data) next_state = DETECT_110;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_110: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECT_1101;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECT_1101: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                next_state = SHIFT;\n            end\n            SHIFT: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                if (shift_counter == 3'b011) begin\n                    next_state = COUNT;\n                end\n            end\n            COUNT: begin\n                counting = 1'b1;\n                if (done_counting) next_state = DONE;\n            end\n            DONE: begin\n                done = 1'b1;\n                if (ack) next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
