The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification by creating a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects a specific pattern (`1101`) on the `data` input and then performs a series of actions based on the detected pattern. The FSM is implemented using a set of states encoded as a 3-bit value. The states are:

1. **IDLE**: The initial state where the FSM waits for the first `1` of the pattern.
2. **DETECT_1**: The state after detecting the first `1`.
3. **DETECT_11**: The state after detecting the second `1`.
4. **DETECT_110**: The state after detecting `110`.
5. **DETECT_1101**: The state after detecting the complete pattern `1101`. This state triggers the `shift_ena` signal.
6. **SHIFT**: The state where `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles to shift in additional bits.
7. **COUNT**: The state where the FSM waits for the `done_counting` signal, indicating the counting process is complete.
8. **DONE**: The state where the `done` signal is asserted to notify the user. The FSM waits for the `ack` signal to return to the IDLE state.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input signals and the current state. The `shift_counter` is used to ensure that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles. The synchronous reset logic ensures that the FSM returns to the IDLE state when `reset` is asserted.

The implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic. The FSM is designed to be robust and handle all specified conditions.
