Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module \"TopModule\" should be implemented with the following interface and functionality. All ports are single-bit unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Port Definitions:**\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.\n- `input wire reset`: Synchronous reset signal, active high.\n- `input wire data`: Input data stream consisting of a sequence of bits.\n- `output reg start_shifting`: Output signal that will be set high when the target sequence is detected.\n\n**Functional Description:**\n- The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) designed to detect the binary sequence \"1101\" within the input bit stream `data`.\n- Upon detecting the sequence \"1101\", the `start_shifting` output should be set to '1' and remain '1' indefinitely until a reset occurs.\n- The `reset` signal is synchronous and active high. When `reset` is asserted, all state information and the `start_shifting` output must be reset to their initial states.\n- All sequential logic, including flip-flops and state registers, should be triggered on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The initial state of the FSM should ensure that `start_shifting` is set to '0'.\n- Bit indexing for sequences starts from the most significant bit (e.g., \"1101\" should be processed as '1', '1', '0', '1' from left to right).\n\n**FSM Implementation Details:**\n- Define states clearly to manage transitions based on the incoming `data` bit.\n- Ensure that the transitions between states correctly handle partial matches and non-matching sequences.\n- Consider edge cases such as continuous streams of '1's or '0's, and ensure the FSM resets correctly after detecting the sequence and upon reset activation.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Test for boundary conditions, such as the sequence appearing at the very end of the input data stream.\n- Ensure that transitions are stable and free of race conditions by defining state transitions explicitly and using non-overlapping state representations.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the requirements to detect the sequence \"1101\" in a bit stream using a finite-state machine (FSM). The FSM is designed with five states: IDLE, S1, S11, S110, and S1101. Each state corresponds to the detection of a part of the sequence. The `start_shifting` output is set to '1' when the FSM reaches the S1101 state, indicating the full sequence has been detected. The FSM remains in the S1101 state, keeping `start_shifting` high until a synchronous reset occurs. The reset is handled within the sequential always block, ensuring it is synchronous with the clock. The next state logic is implemented using a combinational always block, which determines the transitions based on the current state and input data. The use of `always_ff` and `always_comb` ensures clear separation of sequential and combinational logic, adhering to modern Verilog coding conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    output logic start_shifting\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE  = 3'b000,\n        S1    = 3'b001,\n        S11   = 3'b010,\n        S110  = 3'b011,\n        S1101 = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            start_shifting <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == S1101) begin\n                start_shifting <= 1'b1;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: next_state = (data == 1'b1) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the module `TopModule`, we need to create a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence \"1101\" in a serial input bit stream. The FSM will have five states: IDLE, S1, S11, S110, and S1101. Each state represents the progress of detecting the sequence. The FSM transitions between these states based on the incoming data bit. When the FSM reaches the S1101 state, it indicates that the sequence \"1101\" has been detected, and the output `start_shifting` is set to 1. This output remains 1 until a reset occurs. The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning it resets the FSM and output on the rising edge of the clock when asserted. The FSM is implemented using a state register for the current state and a combinational block for the next state logic.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    output logic start_shifting\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE  = 3'b000,\n        S1    = 3'b001,\n        S11   = 3'b010,\n        S110  = 3'b011,\n        S1101 = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            start_shifting <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == S1101) begin\n                start_shifting <= 1'b1;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: next_state = (data == 1'b1) ?
