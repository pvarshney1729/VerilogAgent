Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal. (1 bit)
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. (1 bit)
- Output Ports:
  - `q`: Output of the Galois LFSR. (32 bits, bit[31] is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB))

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- Taps are located at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1 (corresponding to the indices as 31, 21, 1, and 0 in zero-based indexing).
- The LFSR operates as follows:
  - On the rising edge of the clock (`clk`), if `reset` is high, the output `q` is reset to the initial state of `32'h1`.
  - If `reset` is low, the LFSR shifts right by one bit.
  - The bit entering the MSB (bit[31]) is the XOR of the current MSB (bit[31]) and the current LSB (bit[0]) only if the respective bit positions have taps.
  - Specifically, the new MSB (`q[31]`) is calculated as:
    - `q[31] <= q[0] ^ q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0];`
  - Bit positions without taps shift right unchanged.

Timing and Clocking:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).
- The reset is synchronous, meaning it is evaluated on the rising edge of the clock.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset (when `reset` is high), the shift register initializes to `32'h1`.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The reset condition ensures the LFSR starts from a known non-zero state to avoid the all-zero state, which is a degenerate state for LFSRs.
- Ensure that the LFSR does not enter the all-zero state during normal operation.
