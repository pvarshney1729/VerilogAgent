Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal. (1 bit)\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. (1 bit)\n- Output Ports:\n  - `q`: Output of the Galois LFSR. (32 bits, bit[31] is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB))\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- Taps are located at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1 (corresponding to the indices as 31, 21, 1, and 0 in zero-based indexing).\n- The LFSR operates as follows:\n  - On the rising edge of the clock (`clk`), if `reset` is high, the output `q` is reset to the initial state of `32'h1`.\n  - If `reset` is low, the LFSR shifts right by one bit.\n  - The bit entering the MSB (bit[31]) is the XOR of the current MSB (bit[31]) and the current LSB (bit[0]) only if the respective bit positions have taps.\n  - Specifically, the new MSB (`q[31]`) is calculated as:\n    - `q[31] <= q[0] ^ q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0];`\n  - Bit positions without taps shift right unchanged.\n\nTiming and Clocking:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning it is evaluated on the rising edge of the clock.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset (when `reset` is high), the shift register initializes to `32'h1`.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The reset condition ensures the LFSR starts from a known non-zero state to avoid the all-zero state, which is a degenerate state for LFSRs.\n- Ensure that the LFSR does not enter the all-zero state during normal operation.\n                    "
