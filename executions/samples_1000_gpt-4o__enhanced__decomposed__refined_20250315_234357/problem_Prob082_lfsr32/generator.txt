<REASONING>
To implement the 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified interface, including the input ports `clk` and `reset`, and the output port `q` which is 32 bits wide.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the output `q` to `32'h1` when the `reset` signal is high. This ensures that the LFSR starts from a known non-zero state.

3. **Shift Register Logic**: On each rising edge of the clock, if the reset is not active, the LFSR should shift right by one bit. The new MSB (`q[31]`) is determined by XORing the current LSB (`q[0]`) with the bits at the tap positions (`q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`).

4. **Bitwise Operations**: Use bitwise XOR operations to calculate the feedback for the LFSR. The feedback is inserted into the MSB position while the rest of the bits shift right.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and utilize `always_ff` for sequential logic triggered by the clock. The reset logic is synchronous, so it is handled within the clock edge-triggered block.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specified behavior and coding conventions.
