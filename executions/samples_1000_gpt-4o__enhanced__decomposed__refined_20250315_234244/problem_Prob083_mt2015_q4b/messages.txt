Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input wire x: 1-bit input signal.\n- input wire y: 1-bit input signal.\n- output reg z: 1-bit output signal.\n\nGeneral Description:\nThe TopModule generates an output signal 'z' based on the inputs 'x' and 'y' as defined in the specified waveform. The behavior is combinational and determined by the current values of 'x' and 'y' without any clock dependency, as no clock or sequential elements are explicitly mentioned.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n- The module operates based on the following logical conditions:\n  - If both inputs 'x' and 'y' are 0, the output 'z' remains 1.\n  - If 'x' is 1 and 'y' is 0, the output 'z' becomes 0.\n  - If 'x' is 0 and 'y' is 1, the output 'z' becomes 0.\n  - If both inputs 'x' and 'y' are 1, the output 'z' becomes 1.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The input and output signals are single-bit (1-bit) wide, with bit[0] representing the only and least significant bit.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- As each input is a single bit, the only possible values are 0 or 1. The output response to all possible input combinations has been specified.\n\nInitial Condition:\n- Not applicable, as the module operates in a purely combinational manner and does not rely on any initial or stored state.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
