The task is to implement a combinational logic module named TopModule with inputs x, y, and output z. The behavior of z is defined by a given waveform. By analyzing the waveform, we can derive the logic conditions for z:
- When both x and y are 0, z should be 1.
- When x is 1 and y is 0, z should be 0.
- When x is 0 and y is 1, z should be 0.
- When both x and y are 1, z should be 1.

This behavior can be captured using a simple combinational logic expression: z = (x & y) | (~x & ~y).

The guidelines specify using logic types for ports, and to use assign statements for combinational logic. There is no mention of a clock or reset signal, so the implementation will be purely combinational.
