Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire x: 1-bit input signal.
- input wire y: 1-bit input signal.
- output reg z: 1-bit output signal.

General Description:
The TopModule generates an output signal 'z' based on the inputs 'x' and 'y' as defined in the specified waveform. The behavior is combinational and determined by the current values of 'x' and 'y' without any clock dependency, as no clock or sequential elements are explicitly mentioned.

Behavioral Specification:
- The module operates based on the following logical conditions:
  - If both inputs 'x' and 'y' are 0, the output 'z' remains 1.
  - If 'x' is 1 and 'y' is 0, the output 'z' becomes 0.
  - If 'x' is 0 and 'y' is 1, the output 'z' becomes 0.
  - If both inputs 'x' and 'y' are 1, the output 'z' becomes 1.

Bit Indexing:
- The input and output signals are single-bit (1-bit) wide, with bit[0] representing the only and least significant bit.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- As each input is a single bit, the only possible values are 0 or 1. The output response to all possible input combinations has been specified.

Initial Condition:
- Not applicable, as the module operates in a purely combinational manner and does not rely on any initial or stored state.
