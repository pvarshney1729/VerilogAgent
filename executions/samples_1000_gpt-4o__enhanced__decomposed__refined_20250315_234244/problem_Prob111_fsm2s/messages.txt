Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: `clk` (1-bit) - Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.\n- Input: `reset` (1-bit) - Active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the state machine resets to the OFF state.\n- Input: `j` (1-bit) - Input signal to control state transitions.\n- Input: `k` (1-bit) - Input signal to control state transitions.\n- Output: `out` (1-bit) - Output signal indicating the current state.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module is a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.\n- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and is independent of inputs `j` and `k`.\n\nState Definitions:\n1. OFF State:\n   - Output: `out = 0`\n   - Transitions:\n     - Remain in OFF state if `j = 0`.\n     - Transition to ON state if `j = 1`.\n\n2. ON State:\n   - Output: `out = 1`\n   - Transitions:\n     - Remain in ON state if `k = 0`.\n     - Transition to OFF state if `k = 1`.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous with the clock signal.\n- When `reset` is asserted (high), the state machine transitions to the OFF state on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous, meaning it affects the state on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If `reset` is asserted, the state machine will return to the OFF state regardless of the current state or inputs `j` and `k`.\n- The behavior for all input combinations is explicitly defined by the state transition rules.\n\nNote: Assume `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit when discussing multi-bit signals, though all signals in this module are 1-bit.\n                    "
