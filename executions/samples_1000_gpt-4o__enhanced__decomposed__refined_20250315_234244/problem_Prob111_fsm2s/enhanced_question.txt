Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: `clk` (1-bit) - Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.
- Input: `reset` (1-bit) - Active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the state machine resets to the OFF state.
- Input: `j` (1-bit) - Input signal to control state transitions.
- Input: `k` (1-bit) - Input signal to control state transitions.
- Output: `out` (1-bit) - Output signal indicating the current state.

State Machine Description:
- The module is a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and is independent of inputs `j` and `k`.

State Definitions:
1. OFF State:
   - Output: `out = 0`
   - Transitions:
     - Remain in OFF state if `j = 0`.
     - Transition to ON state if `j = 1`.

2. ON State:
   - Output: `out = 1`
   - Transitions:
     - Remain in ON state if `k = 0`.
     - Transition to OFF state if `k = 1`.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous with the clock signal.
- When `reset` is asserted (high), the state machine transitions to the OFF state on the next rising edge of `clk`.

Clock and Reset:
- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous, meaning it affects the state on the rising edge of `clk`.

Edge Cases:
- If `reset` is asserted, the state machine will return to the OFF state regardless of the current state or inputs `j` and `k`.
- The behavior for all input combinations is explicitly defined by the state transition rules.

Note: Assume `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit when discussing multi-bit signals, though all signals in this module are 1-bit.
