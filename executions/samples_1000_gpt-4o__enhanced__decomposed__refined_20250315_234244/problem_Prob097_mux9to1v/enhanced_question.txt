Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input [15:0] a`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] b`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] c`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] d`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] e`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] f`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] g`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] h`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [15:0] i`: 16-bit input vector.
  - `input [3:0] sel`: 4-bit input vector for selection.

- Outputs:
  - `output [15:0] out`: 16-bit output vector.

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer.
- The `sel` input determines which input vector (a to i) is routed to the output `out`.
  - If `sel` is 0, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `a`.
  - If `sel` is 1, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `b`.
  - If `sel` is 2, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `c`.
  - If `sel` is 3, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `d`.
  - If `sel` is 4, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `e`.
  - If `sel` is 5, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `f`.
  - If `sel` is 6, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `g`.
  - If `sel` is 7, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `h`.
  - If `sel` is 8, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `i`.
  - For `sel` values of 9 through 15, the output `out` is set to all bits '1' (i.e., `out = 16'b1111_1111_1111_1111`).

Additional Notes:
- The multiplexer behavior is combinational logic, with no clock dependencies.
- Ensure that the module handles all possible values of the `sel` input, with defined behavior for unused cases.
- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `bit[15]` is the most significant bit (MSB).
