Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input [15:0] a`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] b`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] c`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] d`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] e`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] f`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] g`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] h`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [15:0] i`: 16-bit input vector.\n  - `input [3:0] sel`: 4-bit input vector for selection.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output [15:0] out`: 16-bit output vector.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer.\n- The `sel` input determines which input vector (a to i) is routed to the output `out`.\n  - If `sel` is 0, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `a`.\n  - If `sel` is 1, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `b`.\n  - If `sel` is 2, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `c`.\n  - If `sel` is 3, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `d`.\n  - If `sel` is 4, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `e`.\n  - If `sel` is 5, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `f`.\n  - If `sel` is 6, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `g`.\n  - If `sel` is 7, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `h`.\n  - If `sel` is 8, the output `out` is assigned the value of input `i`.\n  - For `sel` values of 9 through 15, the output `out` is set to all bits '1' (i.e., `out = 16'b1111_1111_1111_1111`).\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The multiplexer behavior is combinational logic, with no clock dependencies.\n- Ensure that the module handles all possible values of the `sel` input, with defined behavior for unused cases.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `bit[15]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n                    "
