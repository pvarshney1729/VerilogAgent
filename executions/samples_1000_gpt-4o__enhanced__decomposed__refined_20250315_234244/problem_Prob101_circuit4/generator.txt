The task is to implement a combinational logic circuit based on the given truth table. The truth table indicates that the output `q` is `1` when either `b` or `c` is `1`, regardless of the values of `a` and `d`. This can be simplified to the logical expression `q = b | c`. This expression captures all the conditions where `q` should be `1` according to the truth table. Since this is a combinational circuit, we will use an `assign` statement to directly implement this logic without using any sequential logic or always blocks.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    input  logic c,
    input  logic d,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic based on the truth table
    assign q = b | c;

endmodule
