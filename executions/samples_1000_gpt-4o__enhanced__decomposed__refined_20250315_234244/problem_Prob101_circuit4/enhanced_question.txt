Module Specification: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input a` : 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `input b` : 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `input c` : 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `input d` : 1-bit input, unsigned.

- Outputs:
  - `output q` : 1-bit output, unsigned.

Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
- This module implements a combinational logic circuit. It does not contain any sequential logic elements or dependencies on clock cycles.

Behavior:
- The output `q` is determined by the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as specified in the truth table below:

| a | b | c | d | q |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- The output `q` is `1` when any of the following conditions are met:
  1. `c` is `1`.
  2. `b` is `1`.
  3. Both `a` is `1` and `c` is `1`.

Edge Cases:
- All possible combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are covered in the truth table, ensuring complete specification of the behavior.

Note:
- As this is a combinational circuit, the output `q` changes immediately in response to changes in inputs without any delay.
