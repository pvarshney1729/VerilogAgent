Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal for sequential logic. It is a single bit input.\n- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active-high. It is a single bit input.\n- input wire j: Input signal utilized for state transitions. It is a single bit input.\n- input wire k: Input signal utilized for state transitions. It is a single bit input.\n- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state output. It is a single bit output.\n\nState Encoding:\n- State OFF: Encoded as 1'b0, with output out = 0.\n- State ON: Encoded as 1'b1, with output out = 1.\n\nState Transitions:\n- Current State OFF:\n  - If j = 0, stay in state OFF.\n  - If j = 1, transition to state ON.\n- Current State ON:\n  - If k = 0, stay in state ON.\n  - If k = 1, transition to state OFF.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is asynchronous and active-high. When areset is asserted (areset = 1), the state transitions to OFF regardless of the clock signal.\n- Upon reset, the output out is initialized to 0.\n\nClocking:\n- State transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n\nSignal Precedence:\n- The asynchronous reset signal areset takes precedence over clock-driven state transitions. When areset is high, the state is immediately set to OFF regardless of the values of j or k.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All signals are single bit, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up or reset, the module is in the OFF state, and the output out is set to 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that during the asynchronous reset, the state is directly set to OFF without waiting for the clock edge to transition.\n- There are no other specific edge cases beyond normal operation as described.\n                    "
