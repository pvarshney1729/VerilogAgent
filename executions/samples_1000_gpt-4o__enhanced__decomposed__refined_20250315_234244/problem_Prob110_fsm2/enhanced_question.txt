Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal for sequential logic. It is a single bit input.
- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active-high. It is a single bit input.
- input wire j: Input signal utilized for state transitions. It is a single bit input.
- input wire k: Input signal utilized for state transitions. It is a single bit input.
- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state output. It is a single bit output.

State Encoding:
- State OFF: Encoded as 1'b0, with output out = 0.
- State ON: Encoded as 1'b1, with output out = 1.

State Transitions:
- Current State OFF:
  - If j = 0, stay in state OFF.
  - If j = 1, transition to state ON.
- Current State ON:
  - If k = 0, stay in state ON.
  - If k = 1, transition to state OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is asynchronous and active-high. When areset is asserted (areset = 1), the state transitions to OFF regardless of the clock signal.
- Upon reset, the output out is initialized to 0.

Clocking:
- State transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal.

Signal Precedence:
- The asynchronous reset signal areset takes precedence over clock-driven state transitions. When areset is high, the state is immediately set to OFF regardless of the values of j or k.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals are single bit, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon power-up or reset, the module is in the OFF state, and the output out is set to 0.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that during the asynchronous reset, the state is directly set to OFF without waiting for the clock edge to transition.
- There are no other specific edge cases beyond normal operation as described.
