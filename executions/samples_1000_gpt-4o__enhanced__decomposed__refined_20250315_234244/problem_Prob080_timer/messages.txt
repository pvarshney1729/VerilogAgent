        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock signal.\n  - `load`: 1-bit load signal. When asserted (`load = 1`), it loads the internal counter with the given 10-bit value.\n  - `data`: 10-bit input representing the initial count value for the timer. The most significant bit (MSB) is `data[9]`, and the least significant bit (LSB) is `data[0]`.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `tc`: 1-bit terminal count output. Asserted (`tc = 1`) when the internal counter reaches zero.\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. The module implements a countdown timer using a 10-bit down-counter. The timer counts down from a specified number of clock cycles and asserts a terminal count signal `tc` when the count reaches zero.\n\n2. Operation Details:\n   - On each positive edge of the `clk`:\n     - If `load` is asserted (`load = 1`), the internal down-counter is loaded with the 10-bit value from `data`. This load operation can occur at any time, even if the counter is in the middle of counting down.\n     - If `load` is deasserted (`load = 0`), the internal counter decrements by 1, provided it is not already at zero. Once the counter reaches zero, it remains at zero until it is loaded again.\n\n3. Terminal Count Behavior:\n   - The output signal `tc` is asserted (`tc = 1`) when the internal counter reaches zero.\n   - Once the counter reaches zero, `tc` remains asserted until the counter is reloaded with a new value via the `load` signal.\n\n4. Sequential Logic:\n   - The module utilizes a single D flip-flop for the terminal count output `tc`, ensuring that all state changes are synchronized to the positive edge of `clk`.\n\n5. Initial Conditions:\n   - At the start (or upon reset if a reset mechanism is added), initialize the internal counter to zero. The `tc` output should be initialized to zero (`tc = 0`).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - If the `data` input is zero and `load` is asserted, the counter is immediately set to zero, and `tc` is asserted on the next clock cycle.\n   - Ensure that the counter does not roll over when reaching zero; it should halt decrementing and maintain the zero state.\n\nNote: The specification assumes that there is no explicit reset signal unless otherwise stated. If a reset is required, it should be defined as either synchronous or asynchronous and specify the reset behavior of all internal states.\n                    "
