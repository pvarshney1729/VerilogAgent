Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock signal.
  - `load`: 1-bit load signal. When asserted (`load = 1`), it loads the internal counter with the given 10-bit value.
  - `data`: 10-bit input representing the initial count value for the timer. The most significant bit (MSB) is `data[9]`, and the least significant bit (LSB) is `data[0]`.

- Output Ports:
  - `tc`: 1-bit terminal count output. Asserted (`tc = 1`) when the internal counter reaches zero.

Functional Description:
1. The module implements a countdown timer using a 10-bit down-counter. The timer counts down from a specified number of clock cycles and asserts a terminal count signal `tc` when the count reaches zero.

2. Operation Details:
   - On each positive edge of the `clk`:
     - If `load` is asserted (`load = 1`), the internal down-counter is loaded with the 10-bit value from `data`. This load operation can occur at any time, even if the counter is in the middle of counting down.
     - If `load` is deasserted (`load = 0`), the internal counter decrements by 1, provided it is not already at zero. Once the counter reaches zero, it remains at zero until it is loaded again.

3. Terminal Count Behavior:
   - The output signal `tc` is asserted (`tc = 1`) when the internal counter reaches zero.
   - Once the counter reaches zero, `tc` remains asserted until the counter is reloaded with a new value via the `load` signal.

4. Sequential Logic:
   - The module utilizes a single D flip-flop for the terminal count output `tc`, ensuring that all state changes are synchronized to the positive edge of `clk`.

5. Initial Conditions:
   - At the start (or upon reset if a reset mechanism is added), initialize the internal counter to zero. The `tc` output should be initialized to zero (`tc = 0`).

6. Edge Cases:
   - If the `data` input is zero and `load` is asserted, the counter is immediately set to zero, and `tc` is asserted on the next clock cycle.
   - Ensure that the counter does not roll over when reaching zero; it should halt decrementing and maintain the zero state.

Note: The specification assumes that there is no explicit reset signal unless otherwise stated. If a reset is required, it should be defined as either synchronous or asynchronous and specify the reset behavior of all internal states.
