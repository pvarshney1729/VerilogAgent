<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` with the following interface. Input and output ports are defined as follows:

- `input clk`: Clock signal, used to synchronize all sequential logic, active on the rising edge.
- `input load`: Control signal to load the initial state into the system.
- `input [511:0] data`: 512-bit wide input representing the initial state of the cellular automaton.
- `output reg [511:0] q`: 512-bit wide output representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

Functional Description:
1. The module implements Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the next state of each cell is determined by the XOR of its two current neighbors.
2. The state of the system is represented by a 512-cell array `q[511:0]`.
3. The transition rules based on neighboring cells are as follows:
   - If the left neighbor and right neighbor are both 1, the next state is 0.
   - If one neighbor is 1 and the other is 0, the next state is 1.
   - If both neighbors are 0, the next state is 0.
4. The boundaries are assumed to be zero (off), meaning `q[-1]` and `q[512]` are both 0.

Operational Details:
- The system advances by one time step on each rising edge of the `clk`.
- When the `load` signal is high, the state of the system is initialized with `data[511:0]` on the next clock cycle.
- All sequential elements, i.e., the state of the cells, are updated synchronously with the clock.
- The initial state of `q` is unspecified and must be loaded using the `load` signal.

Reset and Initialization:
- No explicit reset signal is provided. The initial state must be loaded using the `load` signal.
- The initial state of `q` is defined by the `data` input when `load` is asserted.

Edge Case Handling:
- For the leftmost and rightmost cells, assume out-of-bound neighbors are zero: `q[-1] = 0` and `q[512] = 0`.
- The behavior at the boundaries should be carefully considered to maintain the correct operation of Rule 90.

This specification ensures that the implementation follows the intended logic and operational flow for Rule 90 with clear definitions for input/output behaviors and boundary conditions.
