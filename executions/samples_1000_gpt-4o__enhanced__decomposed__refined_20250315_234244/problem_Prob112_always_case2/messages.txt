        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `in`: A 4-bit vector input (bit[3:0], where bit[0] is the least significant bit).\n- Outputs:\n  - `pos`: A 2-bit vector output (bit[1:0], where bit[0] is the least significant bit).\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a 4-bit priority encoder using combinational logic.\n- The priority encoder examines the `in` input vector and outputs the position of the first high ('1') bit encountered, starting from the most significant bit (bit[3]) to the least significant bit (bit[0]).\n- If the input vector `in` is zero (i.e., all bits are '0'), the output `pos` should also be zero (2'b00).\n\nOperational Details:\n- The priority encoder operates without any clock signal, as it is purely combinational.\n- The output `pos` is updated immediately based on the input `in` without any delay.\n- The priority is given to the higher index bits. Therefore:\n  - If `in[3]` is '1', then `pos` should be 2'b11.\n  - If `in[3]` is '0' and `in[2]` is '1', then `pos` should be 2'b10.\n  - If `in[3:2]` are '0' and `in[1]` is '1', then `pos` should be 2'b01.\n  - If `in[3:1]` are '0' and `in[0]` is '1', then `pos` should be 2'b00.\n- The module should handle all combinations of the 4-bit input vector.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When `in` is 4'b0000, indicating no high bits, the output `pos` should be 2'b00.\n\nThe design of this module should ensure that there are no race conditions or undefined states, as it is entirely combinational with clearly defined input-output relationships.\n                    "
