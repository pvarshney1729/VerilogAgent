The module, named `TopModule`, is a combinational logic circuit with the following interface:

### Inputs:
- `input wire a`: 1-bit input signal.
- `input wire b`: 1-bit input signal.

### Outputs:
- `output wire out_and`: 1-bit output representing the logical AND of `a` and `b`.
- `output wire out_or`: 1-bit output representing the logical OR of `a` and `b`.
- `output wire out_xor`: 1-bit output representing the logical XOR of `a` and `b`.
- `output wire out_nand`: 1-bit output representing the logical NAND of `a` and `b`.
- `output wire out_nor`: 1-bit output representing the logical NOR of `a` and `b`.
- `output wire out_xnor`: 1-bit output representing the logical XNOR of `a` and `b`.
- `output wire out_anotb`: 1-bit output representing `a` AND NOT `b`.

### Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All signals are 1-bit wide, with `bit[0]` considered as the least significant bit for consistency, even though there is only one bit.

### Functional Description:
- The circuit is purely combinational, meaning all outputs are directly driven by the logic operations on inputs `a` and `b` without any intermediate storage or clock-driven elements.
- Each output is computed as follows:
  1. `out_and`: Logical AND operation on `a` and `b`.
  2. `out_or`: Logical OR operation on `a` and `b`.
  3. `out_xor`: Logical XOR operation on `a` and `b`.
  4. `out_nand`: Logical NAND operation on `a` and `b`.
  5. `out_nor`: Logical NOR operation on `a` and `b`.
  6. `out_xnor`: Logical XNOR operation on `a` and `b`.
  7. `out_anotb`: Logical AND operation on `a` with the NOT of `b`.

### Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The module handles all possible combinations of 1-bit inputs `a` and `b`, specifically:
  - `00`, `01`, `10`, `11`
- The behavior of the logic gates follows standard digital logic truth tables for each specified operation.

This specification ensures clarity in implementation, defining all necessary conventions and the behavior of each output signal based on the given inputs.
