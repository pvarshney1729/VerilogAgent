Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.
  - reset: 1-bit, synchronous active-high reset.
  - in: 1-bit, input signal for state transitions.
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit, output signal based on current state.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.
- State Encoding: 
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table:
- Current State | Next State when in=0 | Next State when in=1 | Output
  - A           | A                    | B                    | 0
  - B           | C                    | B                    | 0
  - C           | A                    | D                    | 0
  - D           | C                    | B                    | 1

Reset Behavior:
- On the assertion of the reset signal, the state machine synchronously resets to State A.
- The reset is active high and synchronous with the clock.

Clock and Edge Sensitivity:
- All state transitions and sequential operations occur on the positive edge of the clock signal.

Output Behavior:
- The output signal 'out' is determined solely by the current state, independent of the input signal 'in'.

Initial Conditions:
- At power-up or reset, the FSM initializes to State A, and the output 'out' is set to 0.

Boundary Conditions:
- The FSM handles all possible input conditions, and transitions occur as defined by the state transition table.
- Any undefined behavior in state transitions defaults to maintaining the current state.

MSB/LSB Conventions:
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- Bit[1] refers to the most significant bit (MSB) when describing the state encoding.
