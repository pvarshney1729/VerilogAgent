<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Ports:
  - zero: bit[0] (1-bit output, active low)

Functional Specification:
- The module shall continuously output a logic LOW (0) on the 'zero' output port.
- The output 'zero' shall not be affected by any input signals as there are no input ports defined for this module.

Behavioral Specification:
- The output 'zero' shall remain in the LOW state (0) at all times regardless of any internal or external conditions.

Edge Cases:
- There are no input signals, hence edge cases related to inputs do not apply.
- The output will consistently maintain the LOW state (0) during all clock cycles and under all conditions.

Reset Behavior:
- There is no reset mechanism defined for this module, as the output is fixed to a constant value.

Timing Specifications:
- The output 'zero' will be valid and stable at the beginning of each clock cycle.

Synchronous/Asynchronous Logic:
- The module consists solely of combinational logic with no sequential elements or dependencies.
