Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire [255:0] in`: A 256-bit wide input vector where each bit can be individually selected by the multiplexer.
  - `input wire [7:0] sel`: An 8-bit wide input vector used to select one of the 256 bits from the `in` vector. `sel` is unsigned, with `sel[0]` being the least significant bit.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: A single-bit output that reflects the value of the selected bit from the `in` vector.

Functional Description:
- This module implements a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.
- The `sel` input determines which bit from the `in` vector is routed to the `out` port.
  - If `sel = 0`, then `out = in[0]`.
  - If `sel = 1`, then `out = in[1]`.
  - ...
  - If `sel = 255`, then `out = in[255]`.

Operational Details:
- The selection logic should be purely combinational, meaning that it does not depend on any clock cycles.
- There are no sequential elements or state dependencies; the output is updated immediately with any change in the `in` or `sel` inputs.
- Ensure that the logic handles all possible values of `sel` from 0 to 255 inclusively, and selects the corresponding bit from the `in` vector.
- The design does not specify behavior for `sel` values outside the 0 to 255 range, as `sel` is an 8-bit input inherently capable of representing only those values.

Edge Cases:
- All combinations of `in` and `sel` within the specified ranges should be accounted for without any undefined behavior.
- The output `out` should reflect the state of the selected input bit in a single evaluation of the combinational logic, with no race conditions.
