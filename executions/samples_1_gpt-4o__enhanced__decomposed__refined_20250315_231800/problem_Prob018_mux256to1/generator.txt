<REASONING>
The task is to implement a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog. The input is a 256-bit vector, and the selection is done using an 8-bit vector. The output is a single bit that corresponds to the selected bit from the input vector. 

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with the specified inputs and output. The inputs are `in` (256 bits) and `sel` (8 bits), and the output is `out` (1 bit).

2. **Port Declaration**: According to the coding conventions, all ports are declared as `logic`. This is a modern practice in SystemVerilog, which is backward compatible with Verilog. It combines the functionality of both `wire` and `reg`.

3. **Multiplexer Logic**: The core functionality is to select one bit from the 256-bit input vector based on the 8-bit selection input. This is efficiently done using an `assign` statement, which is suitable for combinational logic. The expression `in[sel]` directly selects the bit from the `in` vector indexed by `sel`.

4. **Combinational Logic**: Since this is purely combinational logic, there is no need for an `always` block. The `assign` statement is sufficient to continuously drive the output based on the inputs.

5. **No Reset or Clock**: The problem does not specify any clock or reset, so they are not included in the implementation. The logic is purely combinational and updates immediately with changes in the inputs.

6. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The solution is both simple and efficient, leveraging Verilog's ability to handle vector indexing directly in an `assign` statement.

This implementation adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring a clean and efficient design.
