        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- `input  wire clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). The module's sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n- `input  wire reset`: Reset signal (1-bit). Active high, synchronous reset, which initializes the FSM to state A.\n- `input  wire s`: Input signal (1-bit) used to control state transitions from state A.\n- `input  wire w`: Input signal (1-bit) evaluated in state B to determine the output.\n- `output reg z`: Output signal (1-bit) set based on the evaluation of input w.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n1. **State Definitions**:\n   - **State A**: Initial state after reset. The FSM remains in state A as long as `s = 0`. Transitions to state B occur when `s = 1`.\n   - **State B**: Once in state B, the FSM evaluates the input `w` over a span of three consecutive clock cycles.\n\n2. **State Transition and Output Logic**:\n   - **Transition from State A to State B**: Occurs on the positive edge of the clock when `s = 1`.\n   - **Operation in State B**:\n     - The FSM counts the number of times `w = 1` during the next three clock cycles.\n     - If `w = 1` for exactly two out of these three cycles, `z` is set to `1` in the clock cycle immediately following this three-cycle evaluation.\n     - Otherwise, `z` is set to `0`.\n   - The process then repeats, continuously evaluating `w` every set of three clock cycles.\n\n3. **Reset Logic**:\n   - When `reset` is asserted (high), the FSM transitions to state A, and `z` is initialized to `0`.\n   - The reset is synchronous, meaning it is effective only on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n4. **Signal and Bit Indexing**:\n   - All signals are 1-bit wide.\n   - No explicit bit indexing is required due to single-bit nature of signals.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If `reset` is asserted at any point, the FSM immediately returns to state A on the next positive clock edge, regardless of the current state or input values.\n   - During the transition from state A to state B, the evaluation of `w` begins immediately on the next clock cycle after entering state B.\n\n6. **Operational Constraints**:\n   - Ensure no race conditions occur between transitions from state A to state B.\n   - Output `z` must be synchronous with the clock, determined solely by the FSM logic described.\n\nNote: The FSM uses as few states as necessary to achieve the specified behavior.\n                    "

The FSM starts in `STATE_A` and transitions to `STATE_B` when the input `s` is high. In `STATE_B`, the FSM evaluates the input `w` over three clock cycles. If `w` is high in exactly two of these cycles, the output `z` is set to high in the following cycle; otherwise, `z` remains low.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the FSM as specified, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The FSM has two states: `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`. The FSM starts in `STATE_A` and transitions to `STATE_B` when `s` is 1. In `STATE_B`, we count the number of cycles where `w` is 1 over three clock cycles. If `w` is 1 exactly twice, we set `z` to 1; otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The FSM then continues checking `w` every three cycles.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We use a 2-bit encoding for the states. `STATE_A` is `2'b00` and `STATE_B` is `2'b01`.\n\n2. **State Register**: We use an `always_ff` block to update the state on the positive edge of the clock. The reset is synchronous, so it is checked within the clocked block.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: We use an `always_comb` block to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs. In `STATE_A`, we transition to `STATE_B` if `s` is 1. In `STATE_B`, we remain in `STATE_B` and continue counting cycles.\n\n4. **Cycle and Count Logic**: In `STATE_B`, we count the number of cycles and the number of times `w` is 1. After three cycles, we evaluate the count and set `z` accordingly.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is set based on the count of `w` being 1 after three cycles in `STATE_B`.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic. We adhere to the synchronous reset requirement and ensure all logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic s,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] w_count;\n    logic [1:0] cycle_count;\n\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            w_count <= 2'b00;\n            cycle_count <= 2'b00;\n            z <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == STATE_B) begin\n                cycle_count <= cycle_count + 1;\n                if (w) begin\n                    w_count <= w_count + 1;\n                end\n                if (cycle_count == 2'b10) begin\n                    z <= (w_count == 2'b10) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    w_count <= 2'b00;\n                    cycle_count <= 2'b00;\n                end\n            end else begin\n                z <= 1'b0;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (s) begin\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n                end\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                if (cycle_count == 2'b10) begin\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                end\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
