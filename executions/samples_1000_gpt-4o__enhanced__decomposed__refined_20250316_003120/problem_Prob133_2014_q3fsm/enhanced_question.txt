Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- `input  wire clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). The module's sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
- `input  wire reset`: Reset signal (1-bit). Active high, synchronous reset, which initializes the FSM to state A.
- `input  wire s`: Input signal (1-bit) used to control state transitions from state A.
- `input  wire w`: Input signal (1-bit) evaluated in state B to determine the output.
- `output reg z`: Output signal (1-bit) set based on the evaluation of input w.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
1. **State Definitions**:
   - **State A**: Initial state after reset. The FSM remains in state A as long as `s = 0`. Transitions to state B occur when `s = 1`.
   - **State B**: Once in state B, the FSM evaluates the input `w` over a span of three consecutive clock cycles.

2. **State Transition and Output Logic**:
   - **Transition from State A to State B**: Occurs on the positive edge of the clock when `s = 1`.
   - **Operation in State B**:
     - The FSM counts the number of times `w = 1` during the next three clock cycles.
     - If `w = 1` for exactly two out of these three cycles, `z` is set to `1` in the clock cycle immediately following this three-cycle evaluation.
     - Otherwise, `z` is set to `0`.
   - The process then repeats, continuously evaluating `w` every set of three clock cycles.

3. **Reset Logic**:
   - When `reset` is asserted (high), the FSM transitions to state A, and `z` is initialized to `0`.
   - The reset is synchronous, meaning it is effective only on the positive edge of the clock.

4. **Signal and Bit Indexing**:
   - All signals are 1-bit wide.
   - No explicit bit indexing is required due to single-bit nature of signals.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `reset` is asserted at any point, the FSM immediately returns to state A on the next positive clock edge, regardless of the current state or input values.
   - During the transition from state A to state B, the evaluation of `w` begins immediately on the next clock cycle after entering state B.

6. **Operational Constraints**:
   - Ensure no race conditions occur between transitions from state A to state B.
   - Output `z` must be synchronous with the clock, determined solely by the FSM logic described.

Note: The FSM uses as few states as necessary to achieve the specified behavior.
