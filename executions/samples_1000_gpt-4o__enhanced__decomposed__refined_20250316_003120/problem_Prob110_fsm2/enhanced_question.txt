Module Name: TopModule

Port Specification:
- input clk: Clock signal, 1-bit wide.
- input areset: Asynchronous reset, active-high, 1-bit wide.
- input j: Input signal J, 1-bit wide.
- input k: Input signal K, 1-bit wide.
- output reg out: Output signal, 1-bit wide.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- Each state has an associated output value:
  - OFF state: Output (out) is 0.
  - ON state: Output (out) is 1.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is asynchronous and active-high. When 'areset' is high, the state machine transitions to the OFF state, regardless of the clock signal.

State Transition Logic:
- OFF State Transitions:
  - If j = 0, remain in OFF state.
  - If j = 1, transition to ON state.

- ON State Transitions:
  - If k = 0, remain in ON state.
  - If k = 1, transition to OFF state.

Clock and Sequential Logic:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal unless an asynchronous reset is triggered.

Initial State:
- Upon initialization or when 'areset' is high, the state machine sets the current state to OFF.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All signals are 1-bit wide.
- The state machine uses a single flip-flop to store the current state, where OFF is represented as 0 and ON as 1.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The state machine handles all combinations of input signals J and K as specified by the state transition logic.
- Asynchronous reset takes precedence over all other inputs, and the state machine will always reset to the OFF state when 'areset' is high.
