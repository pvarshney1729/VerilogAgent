When 'areset' is high, the state machine transitions to the OFF state, regardless of the clock signal.\n\nState Transition Logic:\n- OFF State Transitions:\n  - If j = 0, remain in OFF state.\n  - If j = 1, transition to ON state.\n\n- ON State Transitions:\n  - If k = 0, remain in ON state.\n  - If k = 1, transition to OFF state.\n\nClock and Sequential Logic:\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal unless an asynchronous reset is triggered.\n\nInitial State:\n- Upon initialization or when 'areset' is high, the state machine sets the current state to OFF.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- All signals are 1-bit wide.\n- The state machine uses a single flip-flop to store the current state, where OFF is represented as 0 and ON as 1.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The state machine handles all combinations of input signals J and K as specified by the state transition logic.\n- Asynchronous reset takes precedence over all other inputs, and the state machine will always reset to the OFF state when 'areset' is high.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. Each state has a specific output, and transitions between states are determined by the inputs j and k. The module uses an asynchronous reset to ensure that the state machine starts in the OFF state when areset is high.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We use a 1-bit logic type to represent the states, with OFF as 0 and ON as 1. This simplifies the state transition logic.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An always block with a combinational sensitivity list (always @(*)) is used to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs j and k. This block evaluates the state transitions as per the state diagram.\n\n3. **State Register**: An always block with a sensitivity list including both the clock and asynchronous reset (posedge clk or posedge areset) is used to update the current state. If areset is high, the state is set to OFF; otherwise, it transitions to the next state on the rising edge of the clock.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: Another always block with a combinational sensitivity list is used to set the output based on the current state. This ensures that the output reflects the state machine's current state.\n\n5. **Port and Signal Declaration**: All ports and signals are declared as logic types, adhering to the coding conventions provided.\n\nBy following these steps, the module correctly implements the specified Moore state machine with the given interface and behavior.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [0:0] {\n        OFF = 1'b0,\n        ON  = 1'b1\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            OFF: next_state = (j) ?
