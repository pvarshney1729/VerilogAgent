Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for `TopModule`:\n\n1. **Module Interface:**\n   - **Input Ports:**\n     - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n     - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n     - `input wire w`: Input signal determining state transitions.\n   - **Output Ports:**\n     - `output reg z`: Output signal, represents the state machine output.\n\n2. **State Machine Description:**\n   - **State Encoding:**\n     - Use a 3-bit encoded state variable `state` to represent each state.\n     - Assign the following state codes:\n       - State A: 3'b000\n       - State B: 3'b001\n       - State C: 3'b010\n       - State D: 3'b011\n       - State E: 3'b100\n       - State F: 3'b101\n\n   - **State Transitions:**\n     - From State A:\n       - `w == 1` : Transition to State B\n       - `w == 0` : Remain in State A\n     - From State B:\n       - `w == 1` : Transition to State C\n       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D\n     - From State C:\n       - `w == 1` : Transition to State E\n       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D\n     - From State D:\n       - `w == 1` : Transition to State F\n       - `w == 0` : Transition to State A\n     - From State E:\n       - `w == 1` : Remain in State E\n       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D\n     - From State F:\n       - `w == 1` : Transition to State C\n       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D\n\n3. **Output Logic:**\n   - The output `z` depends on the current state as follows:\n     - `z = 1` for States E and F\n     - `z = 0` for States A, B, C, and D\n\n4. **Reset Behavior:**\n   - On the assertion of the `reset` signal, the state machine transitions to State A irrespective of the input `w`.\n\n5. **Implementation Guidelines:**\n   - Use separate `always` blocks for:\n     - State transitions (state table) based on current state and input `w`.\n     - State register updates on the positive edge of the `clk` and synchronous `reset`.\n   - `z` should be assigned using an `always` block sensitive to state changes or a continuous assignment.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundaries:**\n   - Ensure that all possible states are accounted for, and transitions are clearly defined for each input condition.\n   - State transitions should be handled carefully to avoid any undefined behavior.\n                    "

The module is designed to implement a finite state machine (FSM) with six states (A, B, C, D, E, F), each encoded using a 3-bit logic vector. The FSM transitions between states based on the input `w`, and the output `z` is determined by the current state.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit logic vector, allowing for up to 8 unique states, though only 6 are used. This encoding is defined using a `typedef` for clarity and ease of use.\n\n2. **State Flip-Flops**: The current state is stored in a flip-flop, updated on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset ensures that the FSM resets to state A when the reset signal is high.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `w`. This block is combinational, ensuring that the next state is calculated correctly for each clock cycle.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is assigned using a continuous assignment statement. It is set to 1 when the FSM is in states E or F, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, avoiding explicit sensitivity lists in combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State flip-flops with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset)\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (w) ?
