Module Specification for `TopModule`:

1. **Module Interface:**
   - **Input Ports:**
     - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
     - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.
     - `input wire w`: Input signal determining state transitions.
   - **Output Ports:**
     - `output reg z`: Output signal, represents the state machine output.

2. **State Machine Description:**
   - **State Encoding:**
     - Use a 3-bit encoded state variable `state` to represent each state.
     - Assign the following state codes:
       - State A: 3'b000
       - State B: 3'b001
       - State C: 3'b010
       - State D: 3'b011
       - State E: 3'b100
       - State F: 3'b101

   - **State Transitions:**
     - From State A:
       - `w == 1` : Transition to State B
       - `w == 0` : Remain in State A
     - From State B:
       - `w == 1` : Transition to State C
       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D
     - From State C:
       - `w == 1` : Transition to State E
       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D
     - From State D:
       - `w == 1` : Transition to State F
       - `w == 0` : Transition to State A
     - From State E:
       - `w == 1` : Remain in State E
       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D
     - From State F:
       - `w == 1` : Transition to State C
       - `w == 0` : Transition to State D

3. **Output Logic:**
   - The output `z` depends on the current state as follows:
     - `z = 1` for States E and F
     - `z = 0` for States A, B, C, and D

4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - On the assertion of the `reset` signal, the state machine transitions to State A irrespective of the input `w`.

5. **Implementation Guidelines:**
   - Use separate `always` blocks for:
     - State transitions (state table) based on current state and input `w`.
     - State register updates on the positive edge of the `clk` and synchronous `reset`.
   - `z` should be assigned using an `always` block sensitive to state changes or a continuous assignment.

6. **Edge Cases and Boundaries:**
   - Ensure that all possible states are accounted for, and transitions are clearly defined for each input condition.
   - State transitions should be handled carefully to avoid any undefined behavior.
