<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specifications and guidelines for a finite state machine (FSM) with synchronous reset and state transitions based on input `w`. The module is designed using the following steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is declared with the specified input and output ports. All ports are declared as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

2. **State Encoding**: An enumerated type `state_t` is used to define the states with 3-bit encoding. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **State Flip-Flops**: An `always` block is used to implement the state register with synchronous reset. The reset condition sets the `current_state` to `STATE_A`.

4. **Next State Logic**: Another `always` block is used to define the combinational logic for state transitions based on the current state and input `w`. The `case` statement is used to handle each state and determine the `next_state`.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is assigned using a continuous assignment statement. It is set to `1` when the `current_state` is either `STATE_E` or `STATE_F`, and `0` otherwise.

This design adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring correct functionality and simulation behavior.
