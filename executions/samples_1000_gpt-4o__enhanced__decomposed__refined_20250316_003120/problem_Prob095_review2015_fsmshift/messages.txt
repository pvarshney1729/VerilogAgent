Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic transitions occur on the positive edge of this signal.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input. When asserted, the FSM resets and specific actions are taken.\n- Output Port:\n  - `shift_ena`: 1-bit output signal to enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module forms part of a Finite State Machine (FSM) designed to control a shift register. Its primary function is to assert the `shift_ena` signal for four consecutive clock cycles when a specific bit pattern is detected. Additionally, upon resetting the FSM, the `shift_ena` signal must be asserted for exactly four cycles, then remain deasserted (logic 0) indefinitely until another reset occurs.\n\nKey Specifications:\n1. **Reset Behavior**: \n   - The reset signal is synchronous and active high. It resets the FSM state and associated counters or registers to their initial values at the next positive clock edge when asserted.\n   - Upon reset, the `shift_ena` output is asserted (logic high) for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles, regardless of any input patterns.\n\n2. **Clock Domain**:\n   - All sequential elements, including the FSM states and any counters, are triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`).\n\n3. **Output Behavior**:\n   - The `shift_ena` output should transition from logic high to logic low after being asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles post-reset.\n   - After these initial 4 cycles post-reset, `shift_ena` should remain at logic low indefinitely until a new reset occurs.\n\n4. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - Upon power-up or initial start, all registers and flip-flops should be initialized to a known state, consistent with a reset condition. This ensures predictable behavior.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the `shift_ena` output does not glitch or transition unexpectedly due to race conditions or asynchronous behavior since all logic is synchronous.\n\n6. **Bit Indexing**:\n   - Bit indexing, if required for internal logic, should consider bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nThis specification ensures that the module performs deterministic and predictable operations, aligning with its intended functional requirements.\n                    "

This ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted immediately after reset.\n\n4. **Cycle Counting**: After reset, we increment `cycle_count` on each clock cycle while `shift_ena` is asserted. Once `cycle_count` reaches 3 (indicating 4 cycles have passed since it starts from 0), we deassert `shift_ena`.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` output is controlled directly within the sequential logic block. It is asserted during the first 4 cycles after reset and deasserted thereafter.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, avoid explicit sensitivity lists in combinational logic, and ensure numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nThis approach ensures that the module meets the specification requirements, with `shift_ena` being asserted for exactly 4 cycles after a reset and remaining deasserted until the next reset.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input  logic clk,\n    input  logic reset,\n    output logic shift_ena\n);\n\n    logic [2:0] cycle_count;\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            cycle_count <= 3'b000;\n            shift_ena <= 1'b1;\n        end else if (shift_ena) begin\n            if (cycle_count < 3'b011) begin\n                cycle_count <= cycle_count + 1'b1;\n            end else begin\n                shift_ena <= 1'b0;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
