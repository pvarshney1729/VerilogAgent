To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to design a simple FSM that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles upon reset and then keep it deasserted until the next reset. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Interface Definition**: The module has a clock (`clk`), a synchronous reset (`reset`), and an output (`shift_ena`). All are 1-bit signals.

2. **State Management**: We don't need explicit state encoding since the behavior is straightforward. Instead, we use a counter (`cycle_count`) to track the number of cycles `shift_ena` has been asserted.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: On reset, we initialize `cycle_count` to zero and assert `shift_ena`. This ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted immediately after reset.

4. **Cycle Counting**: After reset, we increment `cycle_count` on each clock cycle while `shift_ena` is asserted. Once `cycle_count` reaches 3 (indicating 4 cycles have passed since it starts from 0), we deassert `shift_ena`.

5. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` output is controlled directly within the sequential logic block. It is asserted during the first 4 cycles after reset and deasserted thereafter.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, avoid explicit sensitivity lists in combinational logic, and ensure numeric constants are properly sized.

This approach ensures that the module meets the specification requirements, with `shift_ena` being asserted for exactly 4 cycles after a reset and remaining deasserted until the next reset.
