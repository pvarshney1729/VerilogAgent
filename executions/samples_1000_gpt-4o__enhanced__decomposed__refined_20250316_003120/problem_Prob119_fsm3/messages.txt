Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Ports:\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal for triggering all sequential logic elements. Active on the positive edge.\n- `input wire areset`: Asynchronous reset signal. Active high. Resets the FSM to the initial state (State A) upon assertion.\n- `input wire in`: Single-bit input used for determining state transitions.\n- `output reg out`: Single-bit output reflecting the current state's output value.\n\nState Machine Specification:\n- Type: Moore state machine with a total of four states (A, B, C, D).\n- State Encoding: Use two bits to encode the four states.\n  - State A: 2'b00\n  - State B: 2'b01\n  - State C: 2'b10\n  - State D: 2'b11\n\nState Transition Table:\n- Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output\n  - A           | A                 | B                 | 0\n  - B           | C                 | B                 | 0\n  - C           | A                 | D                 | 0\n  - D           | C                 | B                 | 1\n\nFunctional Details:\n- All state transitions and output updates occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The `areset` input is an asynchronous reset. When `areset` is asserted (high), the FSM will immediately transition to State A, regardless of the clock.\n- Initial state upon power-up or reset is State A. The output `out` is initialized to 0.\n- Output `out` is solely determined by the current state and is independent of the input `in`.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- For state encoding and any other multi-bit signals, bit[0] is considered the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that during the transition from any state to another, the `out` signal is updated correctly based on the state transition table.\n- When `areset` is deasserted, the FSM resumes normal operation and transitions as per the state table on the next positive clock edge.\n                    "

This allows us to represent each state uniquely with two bits.\n\n2. **State Register with Asynchronous Reset**: We use an `always_ff` block to implement the state register. This block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. When the `areset` is asserted, the state machine resets to state A immediately, regardless of the clock.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: We use an `always @(*)` block to determine the next state based on the current state and the input `in`. This block implements the state transition table provided in the specification.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output is determined solely by the current state. We use another `always @(*)` block to set the output `out` based on the current state. The output is 1 only in state D, as specified.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specification and adheres to the provided coding conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State register with asynchronous reset\n    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A; // Asynchronous reset to state A\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the Moore state machine as specified, we first define the module `TopModule` with the required input and output ports. We use `logic` for all signals as per the coding conventions. The state machine has four states, which we encode using a 2-bit `enum` type for clarity and ease of use. The states are named `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`, corresponding to the binary values `00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`, respectively.\n\nThe state transition logic is implemented in an `always_ff` block, which is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset signal. When `areset` is asserted, the state machine resets to `STATE_A`. Otherwise, it transitions to the `next_state` on the positive edge of the clock.\n\nThe `next_state` logic is implemented in a combinational `always` block. Based on the current state and the input `in`, the state machine transitions to the appropriate next state as defined in the state transition table.\n\nThe output logic is also implemented in a combinational `always` block. Since this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. The output is `1` only in `STATE_D` and `0` in all other states.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring correct functionality and clarity.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State register with asynchronous reset\n    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A; // Asynchronous reset to state A\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in) ?
