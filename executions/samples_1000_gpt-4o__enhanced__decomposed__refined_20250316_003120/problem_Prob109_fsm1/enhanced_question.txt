Module Specification: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.
- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal. When high, the state machine resets to its initial state.
- input wire in: 1-bit input signal that determines state transitions.
- output reg out: 1-bit output signal representing the current state's output.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B.
- State Encodings:
  - State A: 1'b0
  - State B: 1'b1

State Transition Table:
- From State B:
  - If 'in' is 0, transition to State A.
  - If 'in' is 1, remain in State B.
- From State A:
  - If 'in' is 0, transition to State B.
  - If 'in' is 1, remain in State A.

Output Logic:
- In State B, 'out' is 1.
- In State A, 'out' is 0.

Reset Behavior:
- The state machine asynchronously resets to State B when 'areset' is high.
- The asynchronous reset takes precedence over clocked state transitions.

Operation Details:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of 'clk'.
- In the case of 'areset' being asserted, the output 'out' is immediately set according to the reset state (State B) without waiting for 'clk'.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up or reset, the state machine enters State B, and 'out' is set to 1.

Note: The above specification ensures all state transitions and outputs are clearly defined, with a focus on edge-case handling and precedence of control signals.
