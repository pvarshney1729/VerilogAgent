When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

The module is named `TopModule` and has the specified interface with inputs `clk`, `areset`, `in`, and output `out`. The state machine has two states, A and B, encoded as 1-bit logic values. The state transitions and outputs are defined according to the state diagram:\n\n- In state B, the output is 1. If `in` is 0, transition to state A; if `in` is 1, stay in state B.\n- In state A, the output is 0. If `in` is 0, transition to state B; if `in` is 1, stay in state A.\n\nThe state register is updated on the rising edge of `clk` and asynchronously reset to state B when `areset` is high. The next state logic is implemented using a combinational `always_comb` block, and the output is assigned based on the current state.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic {STATE_A = 1'b0, STATE_B = 1'b1} state_t;\n    state_t state, next_state;\n\n    // State register with asynchronous reset\n    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset)\n            state <= STATE_B;\n        else\n            state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (in)\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                if (in)\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to state B for safety\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    assign out = (state == STATE_B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"
