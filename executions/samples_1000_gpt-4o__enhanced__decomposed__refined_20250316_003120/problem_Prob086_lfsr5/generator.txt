<REASONING>
To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified inputs and outputs. The inputs are `clk` and `reset`, and the output is a 5-bit vector `q`.

2. **Signal Declaration**: Use a 5-bit logic vector `lfsr` to hold the current state of the LFSR. This vector will be updated on each clock cycle.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset using an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. When `reset` is high, the LFSR is initialized to `00001`.

4. **LFSR Logic**: On each clock cycle, if `reset` is not asserted, update the LFSR state. The new state is calculated by shifting the current state right and XORing the LSB (`lfsr[0]`) with the tap positions (`lfsr[4]` and `lfsr[2]`). This ensures the LFSR cycles through all possible states except the all-zero state.

5. **Output Assignment**: Assign the current state of the LFSR to the output `q`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the LFSR operates correctly, providing a maximal-length sequence of states.
