<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module `TopModule` is to be implemented with the following interface specifications. Each input and output port is 1 bit wide unless otherwise specified. The module employs a Moore state machine design with defined state transitions and output behavior.

**Ports:**
- Inputs:
  - `input wire d`: Control input for state transitions.
  - `input wire done_counting`: Indicates completion of a counting process.
  - `input wire ack`: Acknowledgment signal for transitioning from the Wait state.
  - `input wire [9:0] state`: One-hot encoded current state of the state machine.
- Outputs:
  - `output wire B3_next`: Asserted when the next state is B3.
  - `output wire S_next`: Asserted when the next state is S.
  - `output wire S1_next`: Asserted when the next state is S1.
  - `output wire Count_next`: Asserted when the next state is Count.
  - `output wire Wait_next`: Asserted when the next state is Wait.
  - `output wire done`: Active when the state machine is in the Wait state.
  - `output wire counting`: Active when the state machine is in the Count state.
  - `output wire shift_ena`: Active during states B0, B1, B2, and B3.

**State Machine Description:**
The state machine operates with the following states: S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, and Wait. Each state is represented by a one-hot encoding, as follows:
- S = 10'b0000000001
- S1 = 10'b0000000010
- S11 = 10'b0000000100
- S110 = 10'b0000001000
- B0 = 10'b0000010000
- B1 = 10'b0000100000
- B2 = 10'b0001000000
- B3 = 10'b0010000000
- Count = 10'b0100000000
- Wait = 10'b1000000000

**State Transitions:**
- From `S`: 
  - Remain in `S` if `d=0`.
  - Transition to `S1` if `d=1`.
- From `S1`:
  - Transition back to `S` if `d=0`.
  - Proceed to `S11` if `d=1`.
- From `S11`:
  - Go to `S110` if `d=0`.
  - Remain in `S11` if `d=1`.
- From `S110`:
  - Transition back to `S` if `d=0`.
  - Move to `B0` if `d=1`.
- From `B0` to `B3`: Sequentially transition from `B0` to `B3` regardless of inputs, asserting `shift_ena` in each state.
- From `B3`:
  - Transition to `Count`.
- From `Count`:
  - Remain in `Count` if `done_counting=0`.
  - Move to `Wait` if `done_counting=1`.
- From `Wait`:
  - Remain in `Wait` if `ack=0`, asserting `done`.
  - Transition back to `S` if `ack=1`.

**Reset Behavior:**
- On reset, the state machine initializes to the `S` state.

**Output Logic:**
- `B3_next` is high when the next state is B3.
- `S_next` is high when the next state is S.
- `S1_next` is high when the next state is S1.
- `Count_next` is high when the next state is Count.
- `Wait_next` is high when the next state is Wait.
- `done` outputs high in the Wait state.
- `counting` outputs high in the Count state.
- `shift_ena` outputs high in states B0, B1, B2, and B3.
