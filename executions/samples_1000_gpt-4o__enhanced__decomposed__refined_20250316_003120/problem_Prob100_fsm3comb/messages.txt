Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire in` (1 bit): Single input signal to determine state transitions.\n  - `input wire [1:0] state` (2 bits): Current state of the state machine, encoded as follows:\n    - A = 2'b00\n    - B = 2'b01\n    - C = 2'b10\n    - D = 2'b11\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [1:0] next_state` (2 bits): Next state of the state machine, represented in the same encoding as `state`.\n  - `output reg out` (1 bit): Output signal of the state machine.\n\nClocking and Reset:\n- This specification only includes the combinational logic for state transition and output generation. Sequential elements such as clocking and reset are not part of this specification.\n\nState Transition Logic:\n- The state transition is determined by the current `state` and the input `in` according to the following table:\n\n  | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |\n  |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n  | A (2'b00)     | A (2'b00)         | B (2'b01)         | 0      |\n  | B (2'b01)     | C (2'b10)         | B (2'b01)         | 0      |\n  | C (2'b10)     | A (2'b00)         | D (2'b11)         | 0      |\n  | D (2'b11)     | C (2'b10)         | B (2'b01)         | 1      |\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output `out` is determined by the current state as follows:\n  - Output is 0 when the current state is A, B, or C.\n  - Output is 1 when the current state is D.\n\nNote:\n- This module only specifies the combinational logic required for determining `next_state` and `out` based on the current `state` and the input `in`. Ensure that the implementation does not assume any specific sequential or clocking behavior.\n                    "
