<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, I followed a structured approach:

1. **State Encoding**: I defined four states (A, B, C, D) using a 2-bit encoding. This allows us to represent all four states efficiently.

2. **State Register**: I used a 2-bit register `current_state` to hold the current state of the FSM. The `next_state` variable is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock. If the `reset` signal is high, the FSM transitions to state A. This ensures that the reset is synchronous with the clock.

4. **Next State Logic**: I implemented the next state logic using a combinational `always @(*)` block. This block uses a `case` statement to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, characteristic of a Moore machine. I used another combinational `always @(*)` block to set the output to `1` only when the FSM is in state D.

6. **Coding Conventions**: I adhered to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset is not in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.

This structured approach ensures that the FSM behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and outputs.
