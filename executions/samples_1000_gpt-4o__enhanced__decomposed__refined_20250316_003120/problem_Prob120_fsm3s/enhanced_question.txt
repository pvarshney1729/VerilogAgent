<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named `TopModule` should have the following interface, with all input and output ports being 1-bit wide unless otherwise specified:

- `input  clk`: Clock input signal for triggering sequential logic operations.
- `input  reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal which sets the FSM to the initial state A upon the next clock edge.
- `input  in`: 1-bit input signal for state transitions.
- `output out`: 1-bit output signal driven by the current state.

The module will implement a Moore state machine characterized by four distinct states: A, B, C, and D. The state transitions and output behavior are defined by the following table:

| Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |
| B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |
| C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |
| D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |

- The state machine must initialize to state A when the `reset` signal is asserted and release on the next positive edge of `clk`.
- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
- The outputs are only dependent on the current state, characteristic of a Moore machine.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning that the FSM will transition to state A only after the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.
- Each state is encoded using the smallest bit width necessary to represent four states (2 bits), with the following encoding:
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

Edge cases and considerations:
- Ensure that all transitions and outputs are explicitly defined for each state and input condition.
- The FSM should handle any undefined states by transitioning to state A upon reset.
- Bit indexing convention: bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

The implementation should ensure that all sequential elements, such as flip-flops, have explicitly defined initial values when reset is asserted.
