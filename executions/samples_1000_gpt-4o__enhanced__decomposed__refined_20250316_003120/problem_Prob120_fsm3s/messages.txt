Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named `TopModule` should have the following interface, with all input and output ports being 1-bit wide unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input  clk`: Clock input signal for triggering sequential logic operations.\n- `input  reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal which sets the FSM to the initial state A upon the next clock edge.\n- `input  in`: 1-bit input signal for state transitions.\n- `output out`: 1-bit output signal driven by the current state.\n\nThe module will implement a Moore state machine characterized by four distinct states: A, B, C, and D. The state transitions and output behavior are defined by the following table:\n\n| Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n| A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |\n| B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |\n| C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |\n| D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |\n\n- The state machine must initialize to state A when the `reset` signal is asserted and release on the next positive edge of `clk`.\n- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The outputs are only dependent on the current state, characteristic of a Moore machine.\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning that the FSM will transition to state A only after the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.\n- Each state is encoded using the smallest bit width necessary to represent four states (2 bits), with the following encoding:\n  - State A: 2'b00\n  - State B: 2'b01\n  - State C: 2'b10\n  - State D: 2'b11\n\nEdge cases and considerations:\n- Ensure that all transitions and outputs are explicitly defined for each state and input condition.\n- The FSM should handle any undefined states by transitioning to state A upon reset.\n- Bit indexing convention: bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nThe implementation should ensure that all sequential elements, such as flip-flops, have explicitly defined initial values when reset is asserted.\n                    "

We use localparam to define these states for clarity and maintainability.\n\n2. **State Register**: We need a register to hold the current state. This register will be updated on the positive edge of the clock. If the reset is high, the state should be set to STATE_A.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: This is a combinational logic block that determines the next state based on the current state and the input `in`. We use a case statement to handle each state and define the transitions as per the given state transition table.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. We use another case statement to set the output `out` based on the current state. The output is 1 only in STATE_D, and 0 otherwise.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is synchronous, so it is checked inside the always block triggered by the clock's positive edge. This ensures that the reset is sampled with respect to the clock.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, avoid explicit sensitivity lists for combinational logic, and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions provided.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input  logic clk,\n    input  logic reset,\n    input  logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    localparam logic [1:0] STATE_A = 2'b00,\n                           STATE_B = 2'b01,\n                           STATE_C = 2'b10,\n                           STATE_D = 2'b11;\n\n    // State register\n    logic [1:0] current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the Moore state machine as specified, I followed a structured approach:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: I defined four states (A, B, C, D) using a 2-bit encoding. This allows us to represent all four states efficiently.\n\n2. **State Register**: I used a 2-bit register `current_state` to hold the current state of the FSM. The `next_state` variable is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input.\n\n3. **Synchronous Reset**: The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock. If the `reset` signal is high, the FSM transitions to state A. This ensures that the reset is synchronous with the clock.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: I implemented the next state logic using a combinational `always @(*)` block. This block uses a `case` statement to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, characteristic of a Moore machine. I used another combinational `always @(*)` block to set the output to `1` only when the FSM is in state D.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: I adhered to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset is not in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the FSM behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and outputs.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input  logic clk,\n    input  logic reset,\n    input  logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    localparam logic [1:0] STATE_A = 2'b00,\n                           STATE_B = 2'b01,\n                           STATE_C = 2'b10,\n                           STATE_D = 2'b11;\n\n    // State register\n    logic [1:0] current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in) ?
