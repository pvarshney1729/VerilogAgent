Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronization (1 bit).
  - `resetn`: Active-low, synchronous reset signal (1 bit). The FSM remains in the initial state while this signal is asserted (logic 0).
  - `x`: Input signal from the motor (1 bit).
  - `y`: Input signal from the motor (1 bit).

- Output Ports:
  - `f`: Control signal for the motor (1 bit).
  - `g`: Control signal for the motor (1 bit).

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
1. Initial State:
   - The FSM starts in the initial state A whenever `resetn` is asserted (logic 0). 
   - In state A, both outputs `f` and `g` are set to 0.

2. State Transition on Reset De-assertion:
   - When `resetn` is de-asserted (logic 1), the FSM transitions on the next rising edge of `clk`.
   - The output `f` is set to 1 for exactly one clock cycle during this transition.

3. Monitoring Input `x`:
   - After setting `f` to 1, the FSM monitors the input `x` over three successive clock cycles.
   - The sequence to detect is: `x` = 1, 0, 1.
   - Once this sequence is detected, set `g` to 1 on the subsequent clock cycle.

4. Monitoring Input `y`:
   - After setting `g` to 1, the FSM monitors the input `y`.
   - If `y` becomes 1 within the next two clock cycles, maintain `g` at 1 permanently (until a reset is triggered).
   - If `y` remains 0 for both cycles, set `g` to 0 permanently (until a reset is triggered).

5. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
   - All operations and state transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the `clk`.
   - Ensure that all registers and flip-flops have a defined initial state upon reset (e.g., `f` = 0, `g` = 0).
   - Handle any potential race conditions by clearly defining the precedence and dependencies of signal evaluations within the FSM.

6. Signal Convention:
   - Bit[0] is defined as the least significant bit in any multi-bit signal conventions.
   - Ensure synchronous logic design to prevent any unintended latching or delays.
