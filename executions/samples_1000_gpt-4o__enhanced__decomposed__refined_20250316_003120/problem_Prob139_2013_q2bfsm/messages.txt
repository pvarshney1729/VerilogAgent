        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronization (1 bit).\n  - `resetn`: Active-low, synchronous reset signal (1 bit). The FSM remains in the initial state while this signal is asserted (logic 0).\n  - `x`: Input signal from the motor (1 bit).\n  - `y`: Input signal from the motor (1 bit).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `f`: Control signal for the motor (1 bit).\n  - `g`: Control signal for the motor (1 bit).\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n1. Initial State:\n   - The FSM starts in the initial state A whenever `resetn` is asserted (logic 0). \n   - In state A, both outputs `f` and `g` are set to 0.\n\n2. State Transition on Reset De-assertion:\n   - When `resetn` is de-asserted (logic 1), the FSM transitions on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n   - The output `f` is set to 1 for exactly one clock cycle during this transition.\n\n3. Monitoring Input `x`:\n   - After setting `f` to 1, the FSM monitors the input `x` over three successive clock cycles.\n   - The sequence to detect is: `x` = 1, 0, 1.\n   - Once this sequence is detected, set `g` to 1 on the subsequent clock cycle.\n\n4. Monitoring Input `y`:\n   - After setting `g` to 1, the FSM monitors the input `y`.\n   - If `y` becomes 1 within the next two clock cycles, maintain `g` at 1 permanently (until a reset is triggered).\n   - If `y` remains 0 for both cycles, set `g` to 0 permanently (until a reset is triggered).\n\n5. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n   - All operations and state transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n   - Ensure that all registers and flip-flops have a defined initial state upon reset (e.g., `f` = 0, `g` = 0).\n   - Handle any potential race conditions by clearly defining the precedence and dependencies of signal evaluations within the FSM.\n\n6. Signal Convention:\n   - Bit[0] is defined as the least significant bit in any multi-bit signal conventions.\n   - Ensure synchronous logic design to prevent any unintended latching or delays.\n                    "

The FSM has several states, each representing a specific stage in the sequence of operations. The FSM starts in `STATE_A` when the reset signal `resetn` is asserted (active low). When `resetn` is de-asserted, the FSM transitions to `STATE_B` and sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle. It then monitors the input `x` for the sequence 1, 0, 1 across states `STATE_C`, `STATE_D`, and `STATE_E`. Upon detecting this sequence, it sets `g` to 1 in `STATE_F`. The FSM then monitors `y` for up to two clock cycles in `STATE_F`. If `y` becomes 1, it transitions to `STATE_G` and maintains `g` at 1. If `y` does not become 1 within two cycles, it transitions to `STATE_H` and sets `g` to 0.

The FSM is designed to control a motor based on inputs `x` and `y`, with outputs `f` and `g` controlling the motor. The FSM has a synchronous, active-low reset (`resetn`) and operates on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`).\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM uses a 3-bit state encoding to represent eight possible states, from `STATE_A` to `STATE_H`. Each state corresponds to a specific part of the FSM's operation.\n\n2. **State Transitions**: \n   - The FSM starts in `STATE_A` when `resetn` is asserted (low). In this state, both `f` and `g` are set to 0.\n   - When `resetn` is de-asserted (high), the FSM transitions to `STATE_B` on the next clock edge, setting `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.\n   - The FSM then monitors the input `x` for the sequence 1, 0, 1 across `STATE_C`, `STATE_D`, and `STATE_E`. Upon detecting this sequence, it transitions to `STATE_F`, setting `g` to 1.\n   - In `STATE_F`, the FSM monitors the input `y`. If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, the FSM transitions to `STATE_G`, maintaining `g` at 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1 within two cycles, the FSM transitions to `STATE_H`, setting `g` to 0 permanently.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: \n   - The output `f` is set to 1 only in `STATE_B` for one clock cycle.\n   - The output `g` is set to 1 in `STATE_F` and remains 1 in `STATE_G`. It is set to 0 in `STATE_H`.\n\n4. **Counter for `y` Monitoring**: A 2-bit counter (`y_counter`) is used to track the number of clock cycles while monitoring `y` in `STATE_F`.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is synchronous, meaning the reset condition is checked on the rising edge of the clock. When `resetn` is low, the FSM returns to `STATE_A`, and all outputs and counters are reset.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and `always_ff` for sequential logic. The `always_comb` block is used for combinational logic without specifying a sensitivity list.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the FSM behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output logic based on the inputs `x` and `y`.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic x,\n    input logic y,\n    output logic f,\n    output logic g\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101,\n        STATE_G = 3'b110,\n        STATE_H = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] y_counter;\n\n    // State transition and output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            f <= 0;\n            g <= 0;\n            y_counter <= 0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            case (current_state)\n                STATE_A: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                    g <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_B: begin\n                    f <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_C: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_D: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_E: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_F: begin\n                    g <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_G: begin\n                    g <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_H: begin\n                    g <= 0;\n                end\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (resetn) next_state = STATE_B;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                next_state = STATE_C;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                if (x) next_state = STATE_D;\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                if (!x) next_state = STATE_E;\n            end\n            STATE_E: begin\n                if (x) next_state = STATE_F;\n            end\n            STATE_F: begin\n                if (y) next_state = STATE_G;\n                else if (y_counter < 2) y_counter = y_counter + 1;\n                else next_state = STATE_H;\n            end\n            STATE_G: begin\n                next_state = STATE_G;\n            end\n            STATE_H: begin\n                next_state = STATE_H;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The FSM uses synchronous logic with a clock and a synchronous reset, adhering to the coding conventions and guidelines provided.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic x,\n    input logic y,\n    output logic f,\n    output logic g\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101,\n        STATE_G = 3'b110,\n        STATE_H = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] y_counter;\n\n    // State transition and output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            f <= 0;\n            g <= 0;\n            y_counter <= 0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            case (current_state)\n                STATE_A: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                    g <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_B: begin\n                    f <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_C: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_D: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_E: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                end\n                STATE_F: begin\n                    g <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_G: begin\n                    g <= 1;\n                end\n                STATE_H: begin\n                    g <= 0;\n                end\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (resetn) next_state = STATE_B;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                next_state = STATE_C;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                if (x) next_state = STATE_D;\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                if (!x) next_state = STATE_E;\n            end\n            STATE_E: begin\n                if (x) next_state = STATE_F;\n            end\n            STATE_F: begin\n                if (y) next_state = STATE_G;\n                else if (y_counter < 2) y_counter = y_counter + 1;\n                else next_state = STATE_H;\n            end\n            STATE_G: begin\n                next_state = STATE_G;\n            end\n            STATE_H: begin\n                next_state = STATE_H;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
