Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. The FSM's sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the FSM to the initial state (000).
  - `x`: 1-bit input signal used to determine the next state.

- Output Ports:
  - `z`: 1-bit output signal derived from the current state.

State Encoding:
- The FSM uses a 3-bit state encoding, represented by `y[2:0]`. 
  - `bit[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB).
  - `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

State Transition and Output Table:
- Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State when `x=0` | Next State when `x=1` | Output `z`
  - 000 | 000 | 001 | 0
  - 001 | 001 | 100 | 0
  - 010 | 010 | 001 | 0
  - 011 | 001 | 010 | 1
  - 100 | 011 | 100 | 1

Reset Behavior:
- Upon a high `reset` signal and the next rising edge of `clk`, the FSM transitions to the initial state `000`.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning it only affects the FSM at the rising edge of the clock when `reset` is high.

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions occur at the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).
- The FSM transitions between states based on the current state `y[2:0]` and input `x`.

Output Logic:
- The output `z` is determined solely by the current state and does not depend on the input `x`.

Initial State:
- When reset is applied, the FSM initializes to the state `000`.

Edge Case Handling:
- Ensure all undefined transitions are handled appropriately to avoid unintended behavior.
- The FSM should maintain stability and not transition to any undefined states.

This specification ensures a clear understanding of the FSM's behavior, input/output configurations, and operational constraints.
