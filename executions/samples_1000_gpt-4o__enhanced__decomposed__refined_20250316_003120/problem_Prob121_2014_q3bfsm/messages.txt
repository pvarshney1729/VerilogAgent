Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. The FSM's sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the FSM to the initial state (000).\n  - `x`: 1-bit input signal used to determine the next state.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `z`: 1-bit output signal derived from the current state.\n\nState Encoding:\n- The FSM uses a 3-bit state encoding, represented by `y[2:0]`. \n  - `bit[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n  - `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nState Transition and Output Table:\n- Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State when `x=0` | Next State when `x=1` | Output `z`\n  - 000 | 000 | 001 | 0\n  - 001 | 001 | 100 | 0\n  - 010 | 010 | 001 | 0\n  - 011 | 001 | 010 | 1\n  - 100 | 011 | 100 | 1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon a high `reset` signal and the next rising edge of `clk`, the FSM transitions to the initial state `000`.\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning it only affects the FSM at the rising edge of the clock when `reset` is high.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions occur at the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n- The FSM transitions between states based on the current state `y[2:0]` and input `x`.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output `z` is determined solely by the current state and does not depend on the input `x`.\n\nInitial State:\n- When reset is applied, the FSM initializes to the state `000`.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Ensure all undefined transitions are handled appropriately to avoid unintended behavior.\n- The FSM should maintain stability and not transition to any undefined states.\n\nThis specification ensures a clear understanding of the FSM's behavior, input/output configurations, and operational constraints.\n                    "

All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **State Register and Next State Logic**: We declare a 3-bit `state` register to hold the current state and a `next_state` logic to determine the next state based on the current state and input `x`.\n\n3. **Synchronous Reset and State Transition**: We use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to implement the state transition logic. If `reset` is high, the FSM is reset to state `000`. Otherwise, the FSM transitions to the `next_state`.\n\n4. **Next State Combinational Logic**: We implement another `always @(*)` block to determine the `next_state` based on the current `state` and input `x`, following the state transition table provided.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: We implement the output logic in a separate `always @(*)` block, where the output `z` is determined solely by the current state, as specified in the output table.\n\n6. **Default Cases**: We include default cases in both the next state and output logic to handle any undefined states, ensuring the FSM remains stable.\n\nThis approach ensures that the FSM operates correctly according to the given specification, with a synchronous reset and state transitions triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    logic [2:0] state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            state <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            3'b000: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b000 : 3'b001;\n            3'b001: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b100;\n            3'b010: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b010 : 3'b001;\n            3'b011: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b010;\n            3'b100: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b011 : 3'b100;\n            default: next_state = 3'b000;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            3'b000: z = 1'b0;\n            3'b001: z = 1'b0;\n            3'b010: z = 1'b0;\n            3'b011: z = 1'b1;\n            3'b100: z = 1'b1;\n            default: z = 1'b0;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
