<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` is based on a finite state machine (FSM) that processes an incoming byte stream to detect and signal the receipt of a three-byte message according to the PS/2 mouse protocol. The FSM transitions through four states: `IDLE`, `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `BYTE3`. 

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit logic vector. The `IDLE` state waits for a byte with `in[3] = 1` to signal the start of a message. The `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `BYTE3` states track the receipt of the first, second, and third bytes of the message, respectively.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The state transition logic is implemented in a sequential `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. It checks for a synchronous reset to initialize the FSM to the `IDLE` state. Otherwise, it updates the current state to the next state.

3. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented in a combinational `always` block. It determines the next state based on the current state and the value of `in[3]`. If `in[3]` is 1 in the `IDLE` state, the FSM transitions to `BYTE1`. It then sequentially transitions through `BYTE2` and `BYTE3`.

4. **Output Logic**: The `done` signal is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the FSM transitions from `BYTE3` back to `IDLE`, indicating the successful receipt of a complete three-byte message. This is implemented in a sequential `always` block.

5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset signal is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with respect to the clock. The FSM and the `done` signal are reset to their initial states when `reset` is high.

The implementation adheres to the coding conventions and guidelines provided, ensuring correct signal declaration, state encoding, and synchronous reset handling.
