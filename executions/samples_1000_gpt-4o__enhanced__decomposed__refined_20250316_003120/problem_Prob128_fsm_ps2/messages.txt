Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1 bit, positive edge-triggered\n  - `reset`: Synchronous reset, active high, 1 bit\n  - `in`: Input data byte, 8 bits wide, where `in[0]` is the least significant bit\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `done`: Message receipt indicator, 1 bit, asserted high for one clock cycle after each complete message is received\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify and process messages in a continuous byte stream adhering to the PS/2 mouse protocol, where each message consists of three bytes.\n- The FSM will:\n  1. Discard bytes until finding a byte where `in[3]` equals 1, identifying the start of a new message.\n  2. Count this byte as the first byte of a three-byte message.\n  3. Continue receiving the next two bytes.\n  4. Assert the `done` signal high for one clock cycle immediately following the successful receipt of the third byte.\n\nFSM Behavior:\n- Initial State: The FSM begins in an idle state, waiting for a byte with `in[3] = 1`.\n- State Transition:\n  - From the idle state, transition to a \"Receiving\" state upon detecting `in[3] = 1`.\n  - In the \"Receiving\" state, count the subsequent bytes until three bytes are received.\n  - Transition back to the idle state after asserting `done` for one cycle.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- The module's sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The `reset` signal is synchronous and resets the FSM to its initial state when high.\n- All internal registers and state variables should initialize to a known state upon reset, ensuring deterministic behavior.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should handle streams with no valid starting byte (`in[3] = 1`) by remaining in the idle state.\n- If a reset occurs during message processing, the FSM should return to the initial state immediately on the next clock cycle.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The `done` signal depends on the internal state of the FSM and is only asserted once the third byte of a message is successfully processed.\n- Ensure no race conditions by clearly separating state transitions and output assertions in the FSM design.\n                    "

The FSM transitions through four states: IDLE, BYTE1, BYTE2, and BYTE3. The IDLE state waits for a byte with in[3] = 1 to identify the start of a message. The BYTE1, BYTE2, and BYTE3 states count the subsequent bytes of the message. The done signal is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte is received. A synchronous reset is implemented to initialize the FSM to the IDLE state.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic [7:0] in,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        IDLE  = 2'b00,\n        BYTE1 = 2'b01,\n        BYTE2 = 2'b10,\n        BYTE3 = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in[3] == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = BYTE1;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            BYTE1: next_state = BYTE2;\n            BYTE2: next_state = BYTE3;\n            BYTE3: next_state = IDLE;\n            default: next_state = IDLE;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            if (current_state == BYTE3)\n                done <= 1'b1;\n            else\n                done <= 1'b0;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` is based on a finite state machine (FSM) that processes an incoming byte stream to detect and signal the receipt of a three-byte message according to the PS/2 mouse protocol. The FSM transitions through four states: `IDLE`, `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `BYTE3`. \n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit logic vector. The `IDLE` state waits for a byte with `in[3] = 1` to signal the start of a message. The `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `BYTE3` states track the receipt of the first, second, and third bytes of the message, respectively.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The state transition logic is implemented in a sequential `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. It checks for a synchronous reset to initialize the FSM to the `IDLE` state. Otherwise, it updates the current state to the next state.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented in a combinational `always` block. It determines the next state based on the current state and the value of `in[3]`. If `in[3]` is 1 in the `IDLE` state, the FSM transitions to `BYTE1`. It then sequentially transitions through `BYTE2` and `BYTE3`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The `done` signal is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the FSM transitions from `BYTE3` back to `IDLE`, indicating the successful receipt of a complete three-byte message. This is implemented in a sequential `always` block.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset signal is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with respect to the clock. The FSM and the `done` signal are reset to their initial states when `reset` is high.\n\nThe implementation adheres to the coding conventions and guidelines provided, ensuring correct signal declaration, state encoding, and synchronous reset handling.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic [7:0] in,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        IDLE  = 2'b00,\n        BYTE1 = 2'b01,\n        BYTE2 = 2'b10,\n        BYTE3 = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in[3] == 1'b1)\n                    next_state = BYTE1;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            BYTE1: next_state = BYTE2;\n            BYTE2: next_state = BYTE3;\n            BYTE3: next_state = IDLE;\n            default: next_state = IDLE;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            done <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            if (current_state == BYTE3)\n                done <= 1'b1;\n            else\n                done <= 1'b0;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
