<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named TopModule, is to be implemented as a Moore state machine with a one-hot state encoding scheme. The following interface is specified:

- `input logic in;`      // Single-bit input signal
- `input logic [3:0] state;` // 4-bit input representing the current state using one-hot encoding
- `output logic [3:0] next_state;` // 4-bit output representing the next state using one-hot encoding
- `output logic out;`    // Single-bit output signal

**State Encoding:**

- State A is encoded as 4'b0001.
- State B is encoded as 4'b0010.
- State C is encoded as 4'b0100.
- State D is encoded as 4'b1000.

**State Transition Table:**

- Current State A:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = A.
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B.
  - Output `out` = 0.

- Current State B:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = C.
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B.
  - Output `out` = 0.

- Current State C:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = A.
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = D.
  - Output `out` = 0.

- Current State D:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = C.
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B.
  - Output `out` = 1.

**Logic Implementation Guidelines:**

1. **State Transition Logic:** Derive the combinational logic equations for transitioning between states based on the `in` input signal and the current state using the specified one-hot encoding.

2. **Output Logic:** The output is derived solely from the current state, adhering to the Moore machine model. The output is determined by the current state irrespective of the input `in`.

3. **Indexing and Convention:** Bit index 0 refers to the least significant bit (LSB) of the state and next_state vectors.

4. **Initial State:** The initial state is not specified in this design and should be managed externally or through a reset mechanism if required in the broader system context.

5. **Combinational Logic:** Ensure that the combinational logic for state transitions and outputs is free of race conditions and properly handles all possible state and input combinations.

This specification ensures the implementation of a Moore state machine with clearly defined state transitions and outputs based on one-hot encoding.
