Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named TopModule, is to be implemented as a Moore state machine with a one-hot state encoding scheme. The following interface is specified:\n\n- `input logic in;`      // Single-bit input signal\n- `input logic [3:0] state;` // 4-bit input representing the current state using one-hot encoding\n- `output logic [3:0] next_state;` // 4-bit output representing the next state using one-hot encoding\n- `output logic out;`    // Single-bit output signal\n\n**State Encoding:**\n\n- State A is encoded as 4'b0001.\n- State B is encoded as 4'b0010.\n- State C is encoded as 4'b0100.\n- State D is encoded as 4'b1000.\n\n**State Transition Table:**\n\n- Current State A:\n  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = A.\n  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B.\n  - Output `out` = 0.\n\n- Current State B:\n  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = C.\n  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B.\n  - Output `out` = 0.\n\n- Current State C:\n  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = A.\n  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = D.\n  - Output `out` = 0.\n\n- Current State D:\n  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = C.\n  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B.\n  - Output `out` = 1.\n\n**Logic Implementation Guidelines:**\n\n1. **State Transition Logic:** Derive the combinational logic equations for transitioning between states based on the `in` input signal and the current state using the specified one-hot encoding.\n\n2. **Output Logic:** The output is derived solely from the current state, adhering to the Moore machine model. The output is determined by the current state irrespective of the input `in`.\n\n3. **Indexing and Convention:** Bit index 0 refers to the least significant bit (LSB) of the state and next_state vectors.\n\n4. **Initial State:** The initial state is not specified in this design and should be managed externally or through a reset mechanism if required in the broader system context.\n\n5. **Combinational Logic:** Ensure that the combinational logic for state transitions and outputs is free of race conditions and properly handles all possible state and input combinations.\n\nThis specification ensures the implementation of a Moore state machine with clearly defined state transitions and outputs based on one-hot encoding.\n                    "
