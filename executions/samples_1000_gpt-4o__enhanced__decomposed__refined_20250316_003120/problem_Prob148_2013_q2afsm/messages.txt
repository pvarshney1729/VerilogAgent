Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for `TopModule`:\n\n1. **Module Interface:**\n   - **Input Ports:**\n     - `clk`: Clock signal, 1 bit.\n     - `resetn`: Active-low synchronous reset signal, 1 bit.\n     - `r`: Request signals from devices, 3 bits (r[2:0]), where `r[0]` is the highest priority and `r[2]` is the lowest priority.\n   - **Output Ports:**\n     - `g`: Grant signals to devices, 3 bits (g[2:0]), where `g[0]` corresponds to the grant for device 0, `g[1]` for device 1, and `g[2]` for device 2.\n\n2. **FSM Description:**\n   - **States:**\n     - State `A`: Idle state where no grants are given. Transition conditions:\n       - Remain in `A` if `r` is 3'b000.\n       - Transition to `B` if `r[0]` is 1 (highest priority).\n       - Transition to `C` if `r[1]` is 1 and `r[0]` is 0.\n       - Transition to `D` if `r[2]` is 1 and `r[0]` and `r[1]` are 0 (lowest priority).\n     - State `B`: Grant to device 0 (`g[0]` = 1). Transition conditions:\n       - Remain in `B` if `r[0]` is 1.\n       - Transition to `A` if `r[0]` is 0.\n     - State `C`: Grant to device 1 (`g[1]` = 1). Transition conditions:\n       - Remain in `C` if `r[1]` is 1.\n       - Transition to `A` if `r[1]` is 0.\n     - State `D`: Grant to device 2 (`g[2]` = 1). Transition conditions:\n       - Remain in `D` if `r[2]` is 1.\n       - Transition to `A` if `r[2]` is 0.\n\n3. **Clock and Reset:**\n   - The FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n   - `resetn` is a synchronous reset. When `resetn` is low, the FSM resets to state `A`.\n\n4. **Implementation Notes:**\n   - Use separate always blocks for state transition logic (state table) and state memory (state flip-flops).\n   - The outputs `g[i]` can be described using either continuous assignment statements or an always block. Ensure that only one `g[i]` signal is high at a time based on the current state.\n   - Assign state codes for states `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` as needed. Ensure that the state encoding allows for correct priority handling and efficient transitions.\n   - All state flip-flops should have a defined reset state, which is state `A`.\n                    "
