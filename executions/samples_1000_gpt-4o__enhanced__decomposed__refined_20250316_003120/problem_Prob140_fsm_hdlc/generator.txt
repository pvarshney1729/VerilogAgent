<REASONING>
To implement the requested module, we need to create a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) that can detect specific bit patterns in a serial data stream. The FSM should recognize three sequences: 
1. "0111110" to signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
2. "01111110" to flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
3. "01111111..." to signal an error (err) for 7 or more consecutive 1s.

The FSM is designed with the following states:
- IDLE: Initial state, waiting for the first '1' after a '0'.
- S1 to S6: Intermediate states representing the detection of consecutive '1's.
- ERROR: State indicating an error condition due to 7 or more consecutive '1's.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input bit 'in'. The outputs 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' are asserted based on the current state and the input bit. The FSM is reset synchronously, meaning the reset signal is sampled with respect to the clock.

The implementation uses a typedef enum to define the states, and two always blocks: one for state transition logic (synchronous with the clock) and another for next state and output logic (combinational logic).

The FSM is initialized to the IDLE state on reset, and the outputs are defaulted to zero unless a specific condition is met.
