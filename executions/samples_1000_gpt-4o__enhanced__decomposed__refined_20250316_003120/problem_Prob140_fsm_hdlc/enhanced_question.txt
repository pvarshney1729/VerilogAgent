Module Specification: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input wire reset: Active high synchronous reset signal.
- input wire in: Serial input data stream.
- output reg disc: Indicates a bit needs to be discarded.
- output reg flag: Indicates a frame boundary.
- output reg err: Indicates an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.

Port Widths and Conventions:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit when indexing is required.

Behavior Description:
The module implements a synchronous HDLC framing protocol using a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to process a continuous bit stream.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
1. Initial State: On reset, the FSM should default to a state as if the previous input was '0'.
2. State Transitions: 
   - Detect and discard a zero following five consecutive 1s: Input sequence "0111110" triggers 'disc' to be asserted.
   - Detect a frame boundary with six consecutive 1s, "01111110": Trigger 'flag' to be asserted.
   - Detect an error condition with seven or more consecutive 1s: Trigger 'err' to be asserted.

Output Signal Timing:
- 'disc', 'flag', and 'err' signals are asserted for a full clock cycle immediately following the detection of the respective condition.

Reset Behavior:
- The FSM transitions to the initial state on the rising edge of the 'reset' signal.
- The reset is synchronous, and all sequential elements, including output registers, are initialized to zero upon reset.

Edge and Boundary Cases:
- The FSM must correctly handle transitions between states to avoid false positives when detecting patterns.
- Ensure output signals are not asserted beyond their intended time frame or due to incorrect pattern recognition.
