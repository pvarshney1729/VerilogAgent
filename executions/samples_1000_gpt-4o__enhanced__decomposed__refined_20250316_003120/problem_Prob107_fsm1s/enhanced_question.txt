Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. This is the primary clock input for sequential elements.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
  - in: 1-bit input signal used to determine state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output signal representing the current state's output value.

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore state machine with two states.
- States:
  - State B: 
    - Output (out) = 1
    - Transitions:
      - If in = 0, transition to State A.
      - If in = 1, remain in State B.
  - State A:
    - Output (out) = 0
    - Transitions:
      - If in = 0, transition to State B.
      - If in = 1, remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is a synchronous active-high signal.
- Upon assertion of reset, the module transitions to State B.
- The reset state of all registers is defined explicitly as State B, with out = 1.

Clock and Timing:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).
- The reset signal is sampled on the rising edge of the clock.

Bit Conventions:
- All signal interactions and state transitions are based on bit[0] being the least significant bit.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up or after reset, the module initializes to State B.

Edge Cases:
- The module behavior is fully defined for all possible single-bit input scenarios as per the state transition rules described.
