        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, shall have the following interface:\n\n- `input clk`: A single-bit clock signal. The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.\n- `input reset`: A single-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- `input data`: A single-bit input representing a bit stream.\n- `output start_shifting`: A single-bit output that indicates when the sequence has been detected.\n\n**Functional Description:**\n\nThe module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that searches for the binary sequence `1101` in the input bit stream `data`. The FSM should have the following states:\n\n1. **Idle State**: The initial state, waiting for the sequence to start.\n2. **State 1**: Detected an initial '1'.\n3. **State 2**: Detected '11'.\n4. **State 3**: Detected '110'.\n5. **Detect State**: Detected the full sequence '1101'.\n\nUpon detecting the sequence '1101', the module will set the `start_shifting` output to '1'. The `start_shifting` signal remains '1' indefinitely until a reset occurs.\n\n**Reset Behavior:**\n\n- The reset signal is synchronous with the clock. \n- When `reset` is asserted (logic high) on the rising edge of `clk`, the FSM should return to the Idle State, and `start_shifting` should be reset to '0'.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n\n- On power-up or reset, the FSM starts in the Idle State.\n- The `start_shifting` output should be initialized to '0'.\n\n**Bit Indexing and Conventions:**\n\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all ports are single-bit.\n- Ensure that all sequential logic and state transitions are triggered by the positive edge of `clk`.\n\n**Edge Cases and Considerations:**\n\n- The FSM should correctly handle overlapping sequences. For example, if the stream is '1101101', it should recognize both occurrences of '1101'.\n- Ensure that race conditions are avoided by ensuring all state transitions occur on the edge of the clock.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` is based on the specification of a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in a serial bit stream. The FSM is designed with the following states:\n\n1. **IDLE**: The initial state, waiting for the first '1' of the sequence.\n2. **S1**: The state after detecting the first '1'.\n3. **S11**: The state after detecting '11'.\n4. **S110**: The state after detecting '110'.\n5. **S1101**: The final state after detecting the complete sequence '1101'.\n\nThe FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. When the sequence `1101` is detected, the FSM enters the `S1101` state, and the `start_shifting` output is set to '1'. This output remains '1' until a reset occurs.\n\nThe reset is synchronous, meaning it is checked on the rising edge of the clock. When `reset` is asserted, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state, and `start_shifting` is reset to '0'.\n\nThe code uses an enumerated type `state_t` to define the states, which makes the code more readable and maintainable. The state transitions are handled in a combinational `always @(*)` block, while the state register and output logic are handled in a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    output logic start_shifting\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE  = 3'b000,\n        S1    = 3'b001,\n        S11   = 3'b010,\n        S110  = 3'b011,\n        S1101 = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State register with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            start_shifting <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == S1101)\n                start_shifting <= 1'b1;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: next_state = (data) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the FSM that detects the sequence `1101`, we first define the states required for the FSM. We use an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the states: `IDLE`, `S1`, `S11`, `S110`, and `S1101`. Each state corresponds to the progress in detecting the sequence.\n\n1. **IDLE**: The initial state, waiting for the first '1'.\n2. **S1**: Detected the first '1'.\n3. **S11**: Detected '11'.\n4. **S110**: Detected '110'.\n5. **S1101**: Detected the full sequence '1101'.\n\nThe FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. When the sequence `1101` is detected, the FSM enters the `S1101` state, and the `start_shifting` output is set to `1`. This output remains `1` until a reset occurs.\n\nThe synchronous reset logic ensures that when `reset` is high, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state, and `start_shifting` is reset to `0`. The FSM transitions are implemented in a combinational `always @(*)` block, while the state register is updated in a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block.\n\nThe code adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset is synchronous with the clock.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    output logic start_shifting\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE  = 3'b000,\n        S1    = 3'b001,\n        S11   = 3'b010,\n        S110  = 3'b011,\n        S1101 = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State register with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            start_shifting <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == S1101)\n                start_shifting <= 1'b1;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: next_state = (data) ?
