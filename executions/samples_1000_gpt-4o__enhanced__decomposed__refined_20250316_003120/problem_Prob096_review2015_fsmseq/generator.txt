<REASONING>
To implement the FSM that detects the sequence `1101`, we first define the states required for the FSM. We use an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the states: `IDLE`, `S1`, `S11`, `S110`, and `S1101`. Each state corresponds to the progress in detecting the sequence.

1. **IDLE**: The initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
2. **S1**: Detected the first '1'.
3. **S11**: Detected '11'.
4. **S110**: Detected '110'.
5. **S1101**: Detected the full sequence '1101'.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. When the sequence `1101` is detected, the FSM enters the `S1101` state, and the `start_shifting` output is set to `1`. This output remains `1` until a reset occurs.

The synchronous reset logic ensures that when `reset` is high, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state, and `start_shifting` is reset to `0`. The FSM transitions are implemented in a combinational `always @(*)` block, while the state register is updated in a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block.

The code adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset is synchronous with the clock.
