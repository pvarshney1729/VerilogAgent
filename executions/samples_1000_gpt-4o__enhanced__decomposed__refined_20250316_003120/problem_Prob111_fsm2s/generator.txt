<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and conventions provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with the specified input and output ports. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **State Encoding**: Two states, `OFF` and `ON`, are defined using `localparam` for clarity and maintainability. These states are encoded as `1'b0` and `1'b1`, respectively.

3. **State Register**: A `logic` type register `state` is used to hold the current state. Another register `next_state` is used to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The state transition logic is implemented in an `always @(posedge clk)` block. The synchronous reset is handled by checking the `reset` signal within this block. If `reset` is high, the state is set to `OFF`.

5. **Next State Logic**: The next state logic is implemented in a combinational `always @(*)` block. The logic follows the state transition diagram provided:
   - From `OFF`, if `j` is 1, transition to `ON`; otherwise, stay in `OFF`.
   - From `ON`, if `k` is 1, transition to `OFF`; otherwise, stay in `ON`.

6. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition. This is implemented in a separate combinational `always @(*)` block.

7. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring synchronous reset logic is correctly implemented without including `reset` in the sensitivity list of sequential blocks.

The implementation ensures that the state transitions and output generation are correctly synchronized with the clock and reset signals, as specified in the original question.
