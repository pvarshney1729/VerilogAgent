Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal for sequential logic.
  - reset: 1-bit, active-high synchronous reset.
  - j: 1-bit, input signal to control state transitions.
  - k: 1-bit, input signal to control state transitions.
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit, represents the state output.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
  - States: 
    - OFF: Output out is 0.
    - ON: Output out is 1.
  - Transition Logic:
    - From OFF:
      - If j=0, remain in OFF.
      - If j=1, transition to ON.
    - From ON:
      - If k=0, remain in ON.
      - If k=1, transition to OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is a synchronous reset, active-high.
- When reset is asserted (high), the state machine transitions to the OFF state.

Implementation Details:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The initial state after reset is the OFF state, with out=0.
- Input signals j and k should be sampled on the rising edge of clk.
- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are 1-bit.
- Ensure there are no race conditions by sampling inputs on the clock edge and using synchronous reset.

Boundary Conditions:
- Ensure proper handling of all combinations of j and k inputs as per the state transition rules defined above.
