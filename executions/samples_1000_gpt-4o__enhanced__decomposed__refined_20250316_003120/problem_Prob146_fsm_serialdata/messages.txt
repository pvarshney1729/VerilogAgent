        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, used for synchronizing sequential logic. All sequential elements trigger on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `input in`: Serial data input bit.\n  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, all registers are set to their initial state on the next positive clock edge.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output [7:0] out_byte`: 8-bit data byte output. This signal represents the byte received after detecting a valid start and stop bit sequence. The data is valid only when `done` is asserted.\n  - `output done`: Signal indicating that a valid data byte has been successfully received, along with a correct start and stop bit sequence.\n\nSerial Protocol Description:\n- The serial communication protocol utilizes a start bit (logic 0), 8 data bits (least significant bit transmitted first), followed by a stop bit (logic 1).\n- The line remains at logic 1 during idle periods when no data is being transmitted.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Design:\n- The FSM should identify the start bit, capture the following 8 data bits, and then verify the presence of a correct stop bit.\n- Upon successful verification of the stop bit, the FSM asserts the `done` signal for one clock cycle, indicating that `out_byte` holds valid data.\n- If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM should discard the current byte and wait until a stop bit is detected before attempting to receive a new byte.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous and active-high. When `reset` is asserted, all internal state machine registers and the `out_byte` register are reset to their initial values on the next rising edge of the clock. The FSM returns to its initial state, ready to detect a new start bit.\n\nBit Indexing and Signal Conventions:\n- `out_byte[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- All operations are synchronized to the positive edge of the clock.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The FSM must handle consecutive bytes without missing any start bits, even if the stop bit of one byte immediately precedes the start bit of the next byte.\n- The system does not need to handle erroneous start bits (e.g., a 1 instead of a 0) as part of this specification. It assumes a valid start bit is always eventually present.\n\nNote: All logic elements are designed to operate correctly under the assumption of ideal signal conditions and do not consider external noise or signal integrity issues.\n                    "
