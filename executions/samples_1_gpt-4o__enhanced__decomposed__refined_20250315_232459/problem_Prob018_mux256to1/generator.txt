<REASONING>
To implement the 256-to-1 multiplexer as specified, we need to use the `sel` input to select one of the 256 bits from the `in` input vector and assign it to the `out` output. This can be efficiently achieved using a simple assignment statement in Verilog, where the `sel` index is used to directly access the corresponding bit in the `in` vector. This approach leverages Verilog's ability to index vectors with variables, making the implementation straightforward and efficient. The module is purely combinational, so no always block is needed, and the use of `logic` for port declarations aligns with modern Verilog conventions.

    input  logic [255:0] in,
    input  logic [7:0]   sel,
    output logic         out
);

    // Assign the selected bit from the input vector to the output
    assign out = in[sel];
