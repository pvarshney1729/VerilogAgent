Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: `in` (256 bits, indexed from 0 to 255, where `in[0]` is the least significant bit).
- Input: `sel` (8 bits, unsigned, with the value range from 0 to 255).
- Output: `out` (1 bit).

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.
- The input vector `in` is a packed 256-bit wide bus where each bit can be individually selected.
- The `sel` input is used to select which bit from the `in` input vector is routed to the `out` output.
- For each valid selection `sel = n` (where 0 ≤ n ≤ 255), the module routes `in[n]` to `out`.
- The module does not perform any sequential operations; it is entirely combinational logic.

Edge Cases:
- The `sel` input must always be within the range 0 to 255. Values outside this range are undefined and must be avoided.
