Module: TopModule

Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with two states (OFF, ON), two inputs (j, k), and one output (out). The reset is an active-high asynchronous reset to the OFF state. The state machine transitions based on the input conditions as described below.

Inputs:
- input clk: Clock signal for synchronizing state transitions. It is a 1-bit signal.
- input areset: Asynchronous reset signal. It is a 1-bit active-high signal that forces the state machine into the OFF state.
- input j: Transition input signal for the state machine. It is a 1-bit signal.
- input k: Transition input signal for the state machine. It is a 1-bit signal.

Output:
- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state. It is a 1-bit signal, where 0 represents the OFF state and 1 represents the ON state.

State Definitions:
- OFF: Represents the state where out = 0. This is the initial state upon reset.
- ON: Represents the state where out = 1.

State Transition Table:
1. From OFF (out=0):
   - If j=0, remain in OFF.
   - If j=1, transition to ON.

2. From ON (out=1):
   - If k=0, remain in ON.
   - If k=1, transition to OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- The areset signal is asynchronous and active-high. When areset is asserted (1), the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state regardless of the clock.

Clock and Signal Behavior:
- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal, except when areset is asserted, which takes immediate precedence.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon the assertion of areset, the state machine is reset to the OFF state, and out is set to 0.

Note:
- Ensure that the design accounts for potential glitches or race conditions by correctly synchronizing the inputs with the clock where necessary.
- Make sure to initialize all sequential elements to their defined states to avoid undefined behavior at startup.
