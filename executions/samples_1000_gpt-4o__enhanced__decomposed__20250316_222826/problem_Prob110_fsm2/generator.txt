<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to define two states: `OFF` and `ON`. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `j` and `k`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, making it a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: Use a simple 1-bit encoding for the states, where `OFF` is `0` and `ON` is `1`.

2. **State Register**: Implement a state register that updates on the rising edge of the clock. The state register should also handle an asynchronous reset (`areset`) to the `OFF` state.

3. **Next State Logic**: Use combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. It is `0` in the `OFF` state and `1` in the `ON` state.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and use `always @(*)` for combinational logic. Ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the module adheres to the specifications and coding conventions provided.
