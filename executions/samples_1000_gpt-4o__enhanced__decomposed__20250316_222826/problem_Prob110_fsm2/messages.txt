Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with two states (OFF, ON), two inputs (j, k), and one output (out). The reset is an active-high asynchronous reset to the OFF state. The state machine transitions based on the input conditions as described below.\n\nInputs:\n- input clk: Clock signal for synchronizing state transitions. It is a 1-bit signal.\n- input areset: Asynchronous reset signal. It is a 1-bit active-high signal that forces the state machine into the OFF state.\n- input j: Transition input signal for the state machine. It is a 1-bit signal.\n- input k: Transition input signal for the state machine. It is a 1-bit signal.\n\nOutput:\n- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state. It is a 1-bit signal, where 0 represents the OFF state and 1 represents the ON state.\n\nState Definitions:\n- OFF: Represents the state where out = 0. This is the initial state upon reset.\n- ON: Represents the state where out = 1.\n\nState Transition Table:\n1. From OFF (out=0):\n   - If j=0, remain in OFF.\n   - If j=1, transition to ON.\n\n2. From ON (out=1):\n   - If k=0, remain in ON.\n   - If k=1, transition to OFF.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The areset signal is asynchronous and active-high. When areset is asserted (1), the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state regardless of the clock.\n\nClock and Signal Behavior:\n- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal, except when areset is asserted, which takes immediate precedence.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon the assertion of areset, the state machine is reset to the OFF state, and out is set to 0.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure that the design accounts for potential glitches or race conditions by correctly synchronizing the inputs with the clock where necessary.\n- Make sure to initialize all sequential elements to their defined states to avoid undefined behavior at startup.\n                    "

Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) to reset the state to OFF when areset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset) begin\n      state <= OFF;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block.

Set output out to 0 when in state OFF and to 1 when in state ON.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // Output logic based on current state\n  assign out = (state == ON) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    "
