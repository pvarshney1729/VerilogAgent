Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\n**Interface:**\n\n- `input  logic clk`: Clock signal for the FSM.\n- `input  logic resetn`: Active-low, synchronous reset. Resets the FSM to the initial state A.\n- `input  logic [2:0] r`: 3-bit input vector where `r[0]` represents device 0's request, `r[1]` for device 1, and `r[2]` for device 2.\n- `output logic [2:0] g`: 3-bit output vector where `g[0]` represents the grant for device 0, `g[1]` for device 1, and `g[2]` for device 2.\n\n**State Encoding:**\n\n- State `A`: Initial state and default state when no requests are made. Encoded as 2'b00.\n- State `B`: Device 0 is granted access. Encoded as 2'b01. `g[0]` is set to 1.\n- State `C`: Device 1 is granted access. Encoded as 2'b10. `g[1]` is set to 1.\n- State `D`: Device 2 is granted access. Encoded as 2'b11. `g[2]` is set to 1.\n\n**FSM Description:**\n\n- **Initial State:** The FSM resets to state `A` on a synchronous reset (`resetn` = 0).\n\n- **State Transitions:**\n  - **State `A`:**\n    - Remains in state `A` if `r[0]=0`, `r[1]=0`, and `r[2]=0`.\n    - Transitions to state `B` if `r[0]=1`.\n    - Transitions to state `C` if `r[0]=0` and `r[1]=1`.\n    - Transitions to state `D` if `r[0]=0`, `r[1]=0`, and `r[2]=1`.\n  - **State `B`:**\n    - Remains in state `B` if `r[0]=1`.\n    - Transitions to state `A` if `r[0]=0`.\n  - **State `C`:**\n    - Remains in state `C` if `r[1]=1`.\n    - Transitions to state `A` if `r[1]=0`.\n  - **State `D`:**\n    - Remains in state `D` as long as `r[2]=1`.\n    - Transitions to state `A` if `r[2]=0`.\n\n**Output Logic:**\n\n- The output vector `g` is determined by the current state:\n  - `State A`: `g = 3'b000`\n  - `State B`: `g = 3'b001`\n  - `State C`: `g = 3'b010`\n  - `State D`: `g = 3'b100`\n\n**Design Constraints:**\n\n- Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic (state table) and state register updates (state flip-flops).\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n- Ensure no race conditions occur by proper ordering in state transitions and output assignments.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n- If multiple requests are made, the FSM will prioritize higher-priority devices (e.g., `r[0]` over `r[1]`, `r[1]` over `r[2]`).\n\nThis specification ensures a clear understanding of the FSM's functionality and its design constraints for implementation in Verilog.\n                    "
