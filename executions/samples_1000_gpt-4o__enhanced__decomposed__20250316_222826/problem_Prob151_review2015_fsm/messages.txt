Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input  clk`: Clock signal for the module. All sequential elements trigger on the positive edge.\n- `input  reset`: Active high synchronous reset. Resets the state machine to its initial state, ready to detect the input pattern \"1101\".\n- `input  data`: Serial data input. Bit[0] is the least significant bit.\n- `input  done_counting`: Signal indicating the completion of the counting process.\n- `input  ack`: Acknowledgment signal from the user, used to reset the state machine after the timer operation is completed.\n- `output shift_ena`: Signal asserted high for 4 clock cycles to enable shifting of additional bits after detecting the pattern \"1101\".\n- `output counting`: Signal asserted high when the state machine is waiting for the counters to finish counting.\n- `output done`: Signal asserted high to notify the user that the timer has completed.\n\nState Machine Behavior:\n1. **Initial State**: The state machine begins in an idle state, continuously checking for the input pattern \"1101\" on the `data` input.\n2. **Pattern Detection**: On detection of the pattern \"1101\", the state machine transitions to the shift enable state.\n3. **Shift Enable**: `shift_ena` is asserted high for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles to allow shifting of additional bits.\n4. **Counting State**: After the shift enable period, the state machine asserts `counting` high and waits for the `done_counting` input to go high, indicating the completion of the count.\n5. **Completion Notification**: Once `done_counting` is high, the state machine asserts `done` high to notify the user of timer completion.\n6. **Acknowledgment and Reset**: The state machine remains in the done state until the user acknowledges by asserting `ack` high. Upon acknowledgment, the state machine resets to search for the next occurrence of the start pattern \"1101\".\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The state machine handles the detection of the \"1101\" pattern in a bit-by-bit manner, ensuring robustness against noise and partial patterns.\n- All state transitions and output assertions are synchronized with the positive edge of the `clk`.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On reset, all outputs (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) are set to low, and the state machine is positioned to search for the input pattern \"1101\".\n\nNotes:\n- All registers and flip-flops should have explicitly defined initial values as part of the reset sequence.\n- Ensure no race conditions by proper synchronization and sequencing of state transitions and output assertions.\n                    "
