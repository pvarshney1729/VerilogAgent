To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we will design a finite state machine (FSM) that transitions through various states based on the input pattern and control signals. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The initial state where the FSM waits for the pattern "1101".
2. **DETECT_1**, **DETECT_11**, **DETECT_110**, **DETECT_1101**: Intermediate states to detect the pattern "1101".
3. **SHIFT**: State where `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles to shift in additional bits.
4. **COUNT**: State where `counting` is asserted, waiting for `done_counting` to be high.
5. **DONE**: State where `done` is asserted, waiting for `ack` to reset to IDLE.

The FSM will use a synchronous reset to initialize to the IDLE state. We will use a counter to ensure `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 cycles. The FSM transitions will be based on the current state and input signals.

The implementation will adhere to the provided coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized. The FSM will be implemented using a combination of sequential and combinational logic.
