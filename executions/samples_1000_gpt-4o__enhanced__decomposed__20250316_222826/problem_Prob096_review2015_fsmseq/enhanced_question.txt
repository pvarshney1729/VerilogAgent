Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal for sequential logic. The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `reset`: Active-high, synchronous reset signal. Resets the state machine and all sequential elements to their initial states upon assertion.
  - `data`: One-bit input, representing the incoming bit stream to be monitored for the sequence 1101.

- Output Ports:
  - `start_shifting`: One-bit output. Set to 1 when the sequence 1101 is detected in the input data stream. Remains 1 until the module is reset.

Behavioral Description:
- The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) designed to detect the specific sequence of bits: 1101.
- The FSM transitions through states based on the bits received from the `data` input, updating on the positive edge of the `clk`, and can be reset synchronously using the `reset` input.

State Machine Details:
- The state machine consists of multiple states tracking the progress of detecting the sequence 1101.
- Upon detecting the sequence, `start_shifting` is set to 1 and remains in this state until a reset occurs.

Reset Behavior:
- `reset` is an active-high signal. When asserted, it synchronously resets the FSM to its initial state, and `start_shifting` is reset to 0.

Bit Indexing:
- Bit[0] is the least significant bit for any required bit indexing operations.

Edge Cases:
- If the sequence 1101 is found, and `reset` is not asserted, `start_shifting` remains 1 indefinitely.
- Upon reset, the FSM returns to its initial state, and `start_shifting` is reset to 0, regardless of the current state or input data.

All sequential logic elements, including state registers, are initialized to their respective reset states when the reset signal is asserted.

Ensure that all dependencies and signal precedence are handled correctly to avoid race conditions.
