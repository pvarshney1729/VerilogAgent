<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in the input bit stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the first `1` of the sequence.
2. `S1`: Detected the first `1`.
3. `S11`: Detected `11`.
4. `S110`: Detected `110`.
5. `S1101`: Detected the complete sequence `1101`.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. Once the sequence `1101` is detected, the output `start_shifting` is set to `1` and remains `1` until a reset occurs. The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the positive edge of the clock.

The implementation will use an `always` block for the state transitions and another `always` block for the next state logic. The `start_shifting` output will be controlled by the state of the FSM, specifically when the FSM is in the `S1101` state.

We will use `logic` for all signals and adhere to the coding conventions provided, such as using `always @(*)` for combinational logic and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.
