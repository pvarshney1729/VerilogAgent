Module Name: TopModule

Port Descriptions:
- `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic. There are no specific requirements for the clock frequency, but it must be stable and free from glitches.
- `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal. Active high. When high, the state machine should immediately transition to the reset state (state B).
- `input in`: Input signal that influences state transitions within the state machine.
- `output out`: Output signal, determined solely by the current state of the state machine.

Port Widths and Signaling:
- All ports (`clk`, `areset`, `in`, `out`) are 1-bit wide.
- Input and output signals are treated as unsigned.

State Machine Specification:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B.
- State Encoding:
  - State A: Encoded as 0
  - State B: Encoded as 1

- State Transition Diagram:
  - State B (output 1) transitions to:
    - State A on input `in = 0`
    - State B on input `in = 1`
  - State A (output 0) transitions to:
    - State B on input `in = 0`
    - State A on input `in = 1`

- Initial State and Reset Behavior:
  - The state machine should asynchronously reset to State B when `areset` is high. This transition is independent of the clock signal.
  - Upon release of `areset`, the state machine should continue operation based on the current input and clock edge.

Output Behavior:
- The output `out` is determined by the state of the machine:
  - It outputs `1` when in state B.
  - It outputs `0` when in state A.

Clocking and Sequential Logic:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- The `areset` signal is asynchronous. It should be used to override the clock-based state transitions when asserted.

Race Conditions and Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the `areset` signal is properly synchronized to avoid metastability when transitioning from asynchronous reset to normal operation.

This specification provides all necessary details for a correct Verilog implementation of the TopModule with defined behavior under all specified conditions.
