<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to define two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The state machine should asynchronously reset to state B when `areset` is high. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state: it is `1` in state B and `0` in state A.

1. **State Encoding**: We'll use a single bit to encode the states, with `0` representing state A and `1` representing state B.

2. **State Register**: We'll use a sequential always block to update the state on the rising edge of `clk` or when `areset` is high. The asynchronous reset will set the state to B.

3. **Next State Logic**: A combinational always block will determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is directly derived from the current state, with `out = 1` for state B and `out = 0` for state A.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We'll use `logic` for all signals, and follow the guidelines for combinational and sequential logic blocks.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions provided.
