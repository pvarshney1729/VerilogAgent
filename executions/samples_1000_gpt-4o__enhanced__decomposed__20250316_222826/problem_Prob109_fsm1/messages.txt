Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Descriptions:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic. There are no specific requirements for the clock frequency, but it must be stable and free from glitches.\n- `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal. Active high. When high, the state machine should immediately transition to the reset state (state B).\n- `input in`: Input signal that influences state transitions within the state machine.\n- `output out`: Output signal, determined solely by the current state of the state machine.\n\nPort Widths and Signaling:\n- All ports (`clk`, `areset`, `in`, `out`) are 1-bit wide.\n- Input and output signals are treated as unsigned.\n\nState Machine Specification:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B.\n- State Encoding:\n  - State A: Encoded as 0\n  - State B: Encoded as 1\n\n- State Transition Diagram:\n  - State B (output 1) transitions to:\n    - State A on input `in = 0`\n    - State B on input `in = 1`\n  - State A (output 0) transitions to:\n    - State B on input `in = 0`\n    - State A on input `in = 1`\n\n- Initial State and Reset Behavior:\n  - The state machine should asynchronously reset to State B when `areset` is high. This transition is independent of the clock signal.\n  - Upon release of `areset`, the state machine should continue operation based on the current input and clock edge.\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- The output `out` is determined by the state of the machine:\n  - It outputs `1` when in state B.\n  - It outputs `0` when in state A.\n\nClocking and Sequential Logic:\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The `areset` signal is asynchronous. It should be used to override the clock-based state transitions when asserted.\n\nRace Conditions and Edge Cases:\n- Ensure that the `areset` signal is properly synchronized to avoid metastability when transitioning from asynchronous reset to normal operation.\n\nThis specification provides all necessary details for a correct Verilog implementation of the TopModule with defined behavior under all specified conditions.\n                    "

Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) to reset to state B when areset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\nlocalparam A = 1'b0, B = 1'b1;\n\nalways @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset)\n        state <= B;\n    else begin\n        case (state)\n            B: state <= (in) ? B : A;\n            A: state <= (in) ? A : B;\n        endcase\n    end\nend\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on the current state and input 'in'.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n    STATE_A = 2'b00,\n    STATE_B = 2'b01\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_A: begin\n        if (in)\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n      end\n      STATE_B: begin\n        if (in)\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n      end\n      default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to STATE_B for safety\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statement. Output 'out' should be based on the current state: out = 1 for state B, out = 0 for state A.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nassign out = (state == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    "
