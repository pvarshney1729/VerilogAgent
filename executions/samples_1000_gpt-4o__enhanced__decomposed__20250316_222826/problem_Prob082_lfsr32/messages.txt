        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n- `output reg [31:0] q`: 32-bit output vector representing the state of the Galois LFSR.\n\nDesign Specifications:\n\n1. **Galois LFSR Description**:\n   - The module should implement a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n   - The LFSR shifts to the right. Taps are present at bit positions 31 (MSB), 21, 1, and 0 (LSB).\n   - For each clock cycle, the new LSB (q[0]) is determined by XORing the current LSB with the tap positions. Specifically, the update logic is:\n     - q_next[31] = q[0] (shift from q[30])\n     - q_next[30] = q[31]\n     - ...\n     - q_next[22] = q[23]\n     - q_next[21] = q[22] XOR q[0]\n     - ...\n     - q_next[2] = q[3]\n     - q_next[1] = q[2] XOR q[0]\n     - q_next[0] = q[1] XOR q[0]\n\n2. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - The reset signal is synchronous and active high.\n   - Upon reset, the output `q` should be set to the initial value of `32'h1`.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic**:\n   - The LFSR state (represented by `q`) is updated on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - Ensure that the reset condition takes precedence over the regular LFSR update logic.\n\n4. **Bit Indexing**:\n   - Bit indices in the output `q` follow the convention where `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `q[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the logic correctly handles the case where `reset` is asserted at any time, setting `q` to `32'h1` regardless of the current state.\n   - The design should avoid any race conditions by ensuring that the synchronous reset logic is correctly implemented.\n\nThis specification ensures a clear and precise understanding of the module's design requirements and behavior.\n                    "
