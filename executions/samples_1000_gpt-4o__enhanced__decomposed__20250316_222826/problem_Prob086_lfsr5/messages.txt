        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPorts:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal, used to trigger sequential logic on its rising edge.\n- `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- `output [4:0] q`: 5-bit output representing the state of the Galois LFSR. Bit 0 (`q[0]`) is the least significant bit.\n\nDesign Description:\n- The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- The LFSR utilizes XOR feedback from specific tap positions to generate the next state.\n- The tap positions for this LFSR are at bit positions 4 and 2 (considering 0-based indexing, where bit 0 is the LSB of `q`).\n- The feedback mechanism works as follows: \n  - XOR the current least significant bit (`q[0]`) with the bits at the tap positions.\n  - Shift the bits of the LFSR (`q`) to the right by one position.\n  - The new value of `q[4]` (the most significant bit) is set to the result of the XOR operation.\n  - Bits without a tap (positions other than 4 and 2) shift unchanged.\n- The LFSR is designed to never enter the all-zero state and will cycle through `2^5 - 1 = 31` unique states before repeating.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On the assertion of the synchronous reset signal (`reset` high), the LFSR output (`q`) is reset to the initial state `00001` (decimal 1).\n- The reset logic is active on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All updates to the LFSR occur on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n- Ensure all logic is free from race conditions by using non-blocking assignments for sequential updates.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The only forbidden state is the all-zero state, which should not be reached given correct initial state and logic.\n- The module should handle any input conditions gracefully, maintaining the maximal-length sequence operation.\n                    "
