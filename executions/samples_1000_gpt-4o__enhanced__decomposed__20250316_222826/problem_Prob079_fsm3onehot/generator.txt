<REASONING>
To implement the TopModule, we need to follow the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module will be a combinational logic block implementing a Moore state machine with one-hot encoding for states. The state transitions and outputs are determined by the current state and the input signal 'in'. We will use an always block with a case statement to handle the state transitions and output logic. The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition.

The state transition table is:
- State A (4'b0001): Next state is A if in=0, B if in=1; Output is 0.
- State B (4'b0010): Next state is C if in=0, B if in=1; Output is 0.
- State C (4'b0100): Next state is A if in=0, D if in=1; Output is 0.
- State D (4'b1000): Next state is C if in=0, B if in=1; Output is 1.

We will use localparam to define the states for clarity and maintainability. The always block will use a case statement to determine the next state and output based on the current state and input 'in'.
