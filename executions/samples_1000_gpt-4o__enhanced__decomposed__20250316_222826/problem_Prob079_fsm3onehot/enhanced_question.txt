Module Specification: TopModule

1. **Interface Description:**
   - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.
   - `input wire [3:0] state`: 4-bit wide input representing the current state using one-hot encoding.
   - `output wire [3:0] next_state`: 4-bit wide output representing the next state using one-hot encoding.
   - `output wire out`: Single-bit output signal.

2. **State Encoding:**
   - State A: `4'b0001`
   - State B: `4'b0010`
   - State C: `4'b0100`
   - State D: `4'b1000`

3. **Operational Details:**
   - The system implements a Moore state machine where outputs depend only on the current state.
   - The state transitions and output are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.

4. **State Transition Table:**
   - Current State (state) | Next State if `in=0` | Next State if `in=1` | Output
   - A (`4'b0001`)         | A (`4'b0001`)        | B (`4'b0010`)        | 0
   - B (`4'b0010`)         | C (`4'b0100`)        | B (`4'b0010`)        | 0
   - C (`4'b0100`)         | A (`4'b0001`)        | D (`4'b1000`)        | 0
   - D (`4'b1000`)         | C (`4'b0100`)        | B (`4'b0010`)        | 1

5. **Logic Design Considerations:**
   - The design focuses on combinational logic for determining `next_state` and `out`.
   - There is no need to implement any sequential logic or storage elements (e.g., flip-flops) within this module.
   - The `out` signal is directly derived from the current state, ensuring it changes only with state transitions.

6. **Assumptions and Constraints:**
   - The input `state` is assumed to be valid one-hot encoded at all times.
   - The module does not handle invalid or multiple active states; such conditions should be managed externally.
   - No reset logic is included since the specification focuses solely on combinational logic.
   - The module assumes synchronous operation without clock or reset dependencies.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - It is assumed that invalid state encodings will not occur, as they are outside the module's responsibility.
