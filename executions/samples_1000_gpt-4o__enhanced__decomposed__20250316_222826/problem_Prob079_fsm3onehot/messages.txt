Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification: TopModule\n\n1. **Interface Description:**\n   - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.\n   - `input wire [3:0] state`: 4-bit wide input representing the current state using one-hot encoding.\n   - `output wire [3:0] next_state`: 4-bit wide output representing the next state using one-hot encoding.\n   - `output wire out`: Single-bit output signal.\n\n2. **State Encoding:**\n   - State A: `4'b0001`\n   - State B: `4'b0010`\n   - State C: `4'b0100`\n   - State D: `4'b1000`\n\n3. **Operational Details:**\n   - The system implements a Moore state machine where outputs depend only on the current state.\n   - The state transitions and output are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.\n\n4. **State Transition Table:**\n   - Current State (state) | Next State if `in=0` | Next State if `in=1` | Output\n   - A (`4'b0001`)         | A (`4'b0001`)        | B (`4'b0010`)        | 0\n   - B (`4'b0010`)         | C (`4'b0100`)        | B (`4'b0010`)        | 0\n   - C (`4'b0100`)         | A (`4'b0001`)        | D (`4'b1000`)        | 0\n   - D (`4'b1000`)         | C (`4'b0100`)        | B (`4'b0010`)        | 1\n\n5. **Logic Design Considerations:**\n   - The design focuses on combinational logic for determining `next_state` and `out`.\n   - There is no need to implement any sequential logic or storage elements (e.g., flip-flops) within this module.\n   - The `out` signal is directly derived from the current state, ensuring it changes only with state transitions.\n\n6. **Assumptions and Constraints:**\n   - The input `state` is assumed to be valid one-hot encoded at all times.\n   - The module does not handle invalid or multiple active states; such conditions should be managed externally.\n   - No reset logic is included since the specification focuses solely on combinational logic.\n   - The module assumes synchronous operation without clock or reset dependencies.\n\n7. **Edge Cases:**\n   - It is assumed that invalid state encodings will not occur, as they are outside the module's responsibility.\n                    "
