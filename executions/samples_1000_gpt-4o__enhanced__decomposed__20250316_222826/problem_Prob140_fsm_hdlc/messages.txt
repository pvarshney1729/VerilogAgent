Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset.\n  - `input in`: Input data stream bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output disc`: Asserted when a bit needs to be discarded due to a sequence of \"0111110\".\n  - `output flag`: Asserted to indicate the detection of the \"01111110\" flag sequence.\n  - `output err`: Asserted when 7 or more consecutive '1's are detected.\n\nInput/Output Details:\n- All input and output ports are 1 bit in width.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to decode a continuous bit stream for specific bit patterns that indicate frame boundaries, discard requirements, and error conditions in synchronous HDLC framing.\n\nFSM Behavior:\n1. **Discard Bit Sequence Detection (`0111110`)**:\n   - When this sequence is detected, the `disc` output is asserted for one clock cycle starting from the next positive edge of the clock.\n  \n2. **Flag Sequence Detection (`01111110`)**:\n   - Detection of this sequence asserts the `flag` output for one clock cycle beginning on the clock cycle following the sequence detection.\n\n3. **Error Condition (`01111111...`)**:\n   - The detection of 7 or more consecutive '1's results in the `err` output being asserted for one clock cycle starting on the next clock cycle after detection.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The FSM should reset to an initial state that behaves as if the previous input bit was '0'. \n- On reset, all outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be deasserted.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- The FSM transitions on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The `reset` signal is synchronous and active-high, ensuring the FSM transitions to the reset state on the next clock edge when `reset` is high.\n\nSpecial Conditions:\n- Ensure that the outputs are only asserted for a full clock cycle immediately after the condition that triggers them is detected.\n- The system assumes that all sequential logic elements, such as flip-flops, are initialized to known values on reset to ensure correct operation.\n                    "
