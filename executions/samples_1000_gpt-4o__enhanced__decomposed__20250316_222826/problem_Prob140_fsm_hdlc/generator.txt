To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we will design a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to detect specific sequences in a bit stream. The FSM will have states corresponding to the number of consecutive '1's seen. We will use a synchronous reset to initialize the FSM to a state that behaves as though the previous input was '0'. The FSM will transition between states based on the input bit, and the outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) will be asserted based on the current state.

1. **State Encoding**: We will define states for each possible number of consecutive '1's, from zero to seven or more. This will allow us to detect the sequences `0111110`, `01111110`, and `01111111...`.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM will transition to the next state based on the current state and the input bit. For example, if the current state is `FIVE_1` and the input is '1', the next state will be `SIX_1`.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs will be asserted based on the current state. For example, if the FSM is in the `FIVE_1` state and the input is '0', the `disc` output will be asserted in the next cycle.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM will reset to the `IDLE` state when the `reset` signal is high, ensuring the FSM behaves as though the previous input was '0'.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the `always @(*)` construct for combinational logic. The FSM will be implemented using an `always_ff` block for sequential logic.

By following these steps, we will ensure that the FSM correctly detects the specified sequences and asserts the outputs as required.
