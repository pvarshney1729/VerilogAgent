<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the State Encoding**: We will use a single-bit encoding for the two states, `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`. This is efficient since we only have two states.

2. **Declare Ports and Signals**: We will declare the input and output ports as `logic` types, as per the coding conventions. We will also declare the state registers and next state logic.

3. **Implement the State Register**: We will use an `always_ff` block to implement the state register with a synchronous reset. The reset will set the state to `STATE_B`.

4. **Implement the Next State Logic**: Using an `always_comb` block, we will define the next state transitions based on the current state and input `in`.

5. **Implement the Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, adhering to the Moore machine principle.

6. **Adhere to Coding Conventions**: We will ensure that all numeric constants are properly sized, and we will use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the given specification and coding conventions.
