Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. It is a Moore state machine with two distinct states. Below is the refined specification with enhanced clarity and precision:\n\n**Module Interface:**\n- `input  wire clk`: This is the clock signal. All sequential logic operations are synchronized with the rising edge of this clock.\n- `input  wire reset`: This is an active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the state machine transitions to the reset state on the next rising clock edge.\n- `input  wire in`: This is the one-bit input signal to the state machine.\n- `output reg  out`: This is a one-bit output signal, which is determined by the current state of the state machine.\n\n**State Definitions:**\n- **State B**: Output `out` is `1`. This is the reset state.\n- **State A**: Output `out` is `0`.\n\n**State Transition Descriptions:**\n- From **State B**:\n  - If `in` is `0`, transition to **State A** on the next rising clock edge.\n  - If `in` is `1`, remain in **State B**.\n\n- From **State A**:\n  - If `in` is `0`, transition to **State B** on the next rising clock edge.\n  - If `in` is `1`, remain in **State A**.\n\n**Reset Behavior:**\n- The reset is synchronous. When `reset` is asserted high, the state machine will transition to **State B** on the next clock edge. The output `out` will be set to `1` in **State B**.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Upon power-up or initialization, the module should be designed to start in **State B**, with the output `out` initialized to `1`, assuming the reset condition is met.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The state transition and output determination are fully dependent on the rising edge of the `clk` signal and the current state.\n- This design ensures that the state transitions occur without any race conditions or glitches.\n- The outputs are strictly governed by the current state, adhering to the Moore machine's principle of state-dependent output.\n\n**Bit Indexing and Conventions:**\n- Since all inputs and outputs are one bit, bit indexing is not applicable in this specification.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- The behavior of the module is well-defined for all input combinations in both states, ensuring robust operation across all possible scenarios.\n                    "
