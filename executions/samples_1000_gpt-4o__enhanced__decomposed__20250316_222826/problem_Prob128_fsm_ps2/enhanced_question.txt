Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, all internal state registers are reset to their initial values.
  - in: 8-bit input data bus, where bit[0] is the least significant bit and bit[7] is the most significant bit.

- Output Ports:
  - done: 1-bit signal indicating the successful receipt of a complete 3-byte message. This signal is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte of a message is received.

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to detect message boundaries in a continuous byte stream according to the PS/2 mouse protocol.
- The FSM operates as follows:
  1. The FSM starts in an idle state and discards incoming bytes until a byte is received with in[3] = 1, indicating the start of a new message.
  2. Upon detection of in[3] = 1, the FSM transitions to a state that expects the subsequent two bytes of the message.
  3. Upon receiving the third byte of the message, the FSM asserts the done signal high for one clock cycle in the next state.
  4. The FSM then returns to the idle state to await the start of the next message.

Behavior under Reset:
- Upon assertion of the reset signal, the FSM returns to the idle state.
- All internal state registers and counters are reset to their initial values, ensuring the module is ready to detect a new message sequence.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- If the byte with in[3] = 1 is followed by fewer than two additional bytes before another byte with in[3] = 1 is detected, the FSM restarts the message detection process from the first byte of the new sequence.
- The FSM is designed to handle continuous streams of bytes without losing message synchronization, provided that the reset signal is not asserted.

Signal Precedence and Dependencies:
- The done signal is solely dependent on the successful detection of a complete 3-byte message sequence and is asserted only after the third byte.
- The FSM's state transitions are based on the value of in[3] and the internal state of the FSM, which is updated on the positive edge of the clock.

Initial Values:
- All state registers within the FSM are to be initialized to ensure the FSM starts in the idle state immediately after reset.
