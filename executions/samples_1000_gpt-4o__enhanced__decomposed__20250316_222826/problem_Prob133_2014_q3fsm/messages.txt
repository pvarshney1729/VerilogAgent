        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic (1-bit).\n- input wire reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal (1-bit). Resets the FSM to the initial state A.\n- input wire s: Control signal used to transition from state A to state B (1-bit).\n- input wire w: Data signal evaluated in state B for determining output (1-bit).\n- output reg z: Output signal set based on the evaluation of input w (1-bit).\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- Initial State: The FSM begins in reset state A.\n- State Transitions:\n  - State A: The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0. Upon s = 1, the FSM transitions to state B in the next clock cycle.\n  - State B: In state B, the FSM evaluates the input w over the next three consecutive clock cycles.\n    - Counting Logic: If w = 1 in exactly two of these three cycles, the FSM sets output z to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, z is set to 0.\n    - The FSM continues to evaluate w in groups of three cycles as long as it remains in state B.\n  - Note: The input s is only relevant in state A.\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The reset signal is synchronous; it must be asserted high to reset the FSM to state A.\n\nOutput Definition:\n- The output z is a registered output, updated based on the conditions defined for state B.\n- In state A, z is not explicitly defined by the FSM behavior and should be considered as maintaining its previous state or reset condition.\n\nConsiderations:\n- The FSM should use a minimal number of states to achieve the described behavior.\n- Ensure that the sequential logic correctly handles all edge cases, such as transitions and reset conditions.\n- Proper initialization of all sequential elements should be considered, particularly following a reset.\n                    "
