Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: Clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - resetn: Active-low, synchronous reset signal. When asserted low, the FSM returns to its initial state, state A.\n  - x: Input signal from the motor.\n  - y: Input signal from the motor.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - f: Output signal controlling the motor.\n  - g: Output signal controlling the motor.\n\nPort Widths:\n- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.\n\nBit Indexing Convention:\n- Single-bit ports do not use bit indexing.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- Initial State: State A\n- Reset Behavior: \n  - When resetn is asserted (low), the FSM remains in state A.\n  - Upon deassertion of resetn (high), the FSM transitions from state A on the next positive clock edge.\n  \n- Output f Behavior:\n  - Upon deassertion of resetn, the FSM sets output f=1 for exactly one clock cycle after the next positive clock edge.\n\n- Output g Behavior:\n  - The FSM monitors input x. When x follows the pattern 1, 0, 1 over three successive positive clock edges, g is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.\n  - Once g is set to 1, the FSM monitors input y for a maximum of two subsequent clock cycles:\n    - If y=1 within two clock cycles, g remains 1 permanently until resetn is asserted.\n    - If y does not become 1 within two cycles, g is set to 0 permanently until resetn is asserted.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- All transitions and output changes occur on positive clock edges.\n- The FSM responds to the reset signal synchronously; thus, the reset state is only entered on the clock edge following the resetn assertion.\n- The FSM's functionality is defined for a continuous operation; unexpected input sequences outside the described patterns will not alter the behavior unless resetn is asserted.\n\nInitial Values:\n- The FSM starts in state A with both outputs f and g initialized to 0.\n                    "
