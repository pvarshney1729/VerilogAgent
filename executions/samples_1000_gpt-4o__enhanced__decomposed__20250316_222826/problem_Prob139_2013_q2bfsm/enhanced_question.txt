Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: Clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - resetn: Active-low, synchronous reset signal. When asserted low, the FSM returns to its initial state, state A.
  - x: Input signal from the motor.
  - y: Input signal from the motor.

- Output Ports:
  - f: Output signal controlling the motor.
  - g: Output signal controlling the motor.

Port Widths:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.

Bit Indexing Convention:
- Single-bit ports do not use bit indexing.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- Initial State: State A
- Reset Behavior: 
  - When resetn is asserted (low), the FSM remains in state A.
  - Upon deassertion of resetn (high), the FSM transitions from state A on the next positive clock edge.
  
- Output f Behavior:
  - Upon deassertion of resetn, the FSM sets output f=1 for exactly one clock cycle after the next positive clock edge.

- Output g Behavior:
  - The FSM monitors input x. When x follows the pattern 1, 0, 1 over three successive positive clock edges, g is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.
  - Once g is set to 1, the FSM monitors input y for a maximum of two subsequent clock cycles:
    - If y=1 within two clock cycles, g remains 1 permanently until resetn is asserted.
    - If y does not become 1 within two cycles, g is set to 0 permanently until resetn is asserted.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- All transitions and output changes occur on positive clock edges.
- The FSM responds to the reset signal synchronously; thus, the reset state is only entered on the clock edge following the resetn assertion.
- The FSM's functionality is defined for a continuous operation; unexpected input sequences outside the described patterns will not alter the behavior unless resetn is asserted.

Initial Values:
- The FSM starts in state A with both outputs f and g initialized to 0.
