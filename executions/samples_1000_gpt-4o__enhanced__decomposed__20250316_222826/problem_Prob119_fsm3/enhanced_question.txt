Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.
  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous reset input, active high. Resets the FSM to initial state A.
  - `in`: 1-bit data input.
- Outputs:
  - `out`: 1-bit data output.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.
- State Transition Table:
  - State A: 
    - Next state if `in` = 0: A
    - Next state if `in` = 1: B
    - Output: 0
  - State B: 
    - Next state if `in` = 0: C
    - Next state if `in` = 1: B
    - Output: 0
  - State C: 
    - Next state if `in` = 0: A
    - Next state if `in` = 1: D
    - Output: 0
  - State D: 
    - Next state if `in` = 0: C
    - Next state if `in` = 1: B
    - Output: 1

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- All state transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The `areset` input is an active high asynchronous reset. When `areset` is asserted, the state machine immediately transitions to state A, regardless of the clock.
- Ensure `areset` is debounced in environments with potential noise to avoid unintended transitions.

Initial Conditions:
- On initialization or reset, the state machine is set to state A.

Operational Details:
- Outputs are determined solely by the current state, as per Moore state machine design.
- Ensure that all state transitions are properly synchronized with the clock, and avoid race conditions by adhering to the positive edge-triggered design.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals are 1-bit and do not require indexing beyond their defined purpose in this specification.

Edge Cases:
- Correct operation is ensured for all combinations of input and reset signals, with specific attention to the correct handling of asynchronous reset conditions.
