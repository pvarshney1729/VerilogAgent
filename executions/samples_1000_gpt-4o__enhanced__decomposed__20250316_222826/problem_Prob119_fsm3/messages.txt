Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous reset input, active high. Resets the FSM to initial state A.\n  - `in`: 1-bit data input.\n- Outputs:\n  - `out`: 1-bit data output.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.\n- State Transition Table:\n  - State A: \n    - Next state if `in` = 0: A\n    - Next state if `in` = 1: B\n    - Output: 0\n  - State B: \n    - Next state if `in` = 0: C\n    - Next state if `in` = 1: B\n    - Output: 0\n  - State C: \n    - Next state if `in` = 0: A\n    - Next state if `in` = 1: D\n    - Output: 0\n  - State D: \n    - Next state if `in` = 0: C\n    - Next state if `in` = 1: B\n    - Output: 1\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- All state transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The `areset` input is an active high asynchronous reset. When `areset` is asserted, the state machine immediately transitions to state A, regardless of the clock.\n- Ensure `areset` is debounced in environments with potential noise to avoid unintended transitions.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On initialization or reset, the state machine is set to state A.\n\nOperational Details:\n- Outputs are determined solely by the current state, as per Moore state machine design.\n- Ensure that all state transitions are properly synchronized with the clock, and avoid race conditions by adhering to the positive edge-triggered design.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All signals are 1-bit and do not require indexing beyond their defined purpose in this specification.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Correct operation is ensured for all combinations of input and reset signals, with specific attention to the correct handling of asynchronous reset conditions.\n                    "
