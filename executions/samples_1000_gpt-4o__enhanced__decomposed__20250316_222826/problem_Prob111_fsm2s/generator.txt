To implement the requested Moore state machine, we will follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. Use `logic` for all signals as per the coding conventions.

2. **State Encoding**: Define the states using an `enum` for better readability and maintainability. The states will be `OFF` and `ON`.

3. **State Register**: Implement the state register with a synchronous reset. The reset will set the state to `OFF`.

4. **Next State Logic**: Use a combinational `always @(*)` block to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as this is a Moore machine. Use a simple assignment to set `out` based on the state.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the provided coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding guidelines.
