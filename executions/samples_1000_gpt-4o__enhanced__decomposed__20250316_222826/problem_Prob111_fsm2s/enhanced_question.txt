Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- input clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
- input reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal. Initiates transition to the OFF state.
- input j: Input signal for state transition when in the OFF state.
- input k: Input signal for state transition when in the ON state.
- output reg out: Output signal reflecting the current state. Defaults to 0 in the OFF state and 1 in the ON state.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal when the reset is not active.
- The reset is active-high and synchronous, meaning it takes effect on the next rising edge of the clock.

State Definitions:
1. OFF State:
   - out = 0
   - Transition to the ON state if j = 1 on the next rising edge of clk.
   - Remain in the OFF state if j = 0 on the next rising edge of clk.

2. ON State:
   - out = 1
   - Transition to the OFF state if k = 1 on the next rising edge of clk.
   - Remain in the ON state if k = 0 on the next rising edge of clk.

Reset Behavior:
- When reset = 1, the state machine transitions to the OFF state and outputs 0 on the next rising edge of the clock.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up, the output reg out and state will default to the OFF state.

Bit Indexing:
- All ports are single-bit signals.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure j and k signals are stable around the rising edge of the clock to avoid metastability issues.
- The reset signal must be stable for at least one clock cycle to ensure a valid state transition.

Note: The state machine assumes a stable clock signal and stable input conditions as specified above to function correctly.
