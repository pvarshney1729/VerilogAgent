<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named `TopModule` is defined with the following interface, where all ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input logic in;` // Single-bit input signal
- `input logic [9:0] state;` // 10-bit input representing the current state using one-hot encoding
- `output logic [9:0] next_state;` // 10-bit output representing the next state using one-hot encoding
- `output logic out1;` // Single-bit output
- `output logic out2;` // Single-bit output

### State Machine Description

The state machine utilizes one-hot encoding for state representation. Each bit in the `state` and `next_state` vectors corresponds to a specific state:

- `state[0]` refers to state `S0`
- `state[1]` refers to state `S1`
- ...
- `state[9]` refers to state `S9`

Transitions between states are based on the input `in`. The outputs `(out1, out2)` are generally `(0, 0)`, except for specific states, as described in the transitions.

#### State Transitions and Output Logic:
- `S0:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S1`
- `S1:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S2`
- `S2:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S3`
- `S3:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S4`
- `S4:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S5`
- `S5:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S8`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S6`
- `S6:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S9`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S7`
- `S7:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (0, 1)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` remains in `S7`
- `S8:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (1, 0)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S1`
- `S9:`
  - `(out1, out2) = (1, 1)`
  - `in = 0` transitions to `S0`
  - `in = 1` transitions to `S1`

#### Encoding and Transition Logic

- The output `next_state` is determined by transitioning from the current state based on the input `in`.
- The `next_state[i]` is set to `1` if the state machine transitions to state `Si`, otherwise it is `0`.
- The module will handle multiple active states in `state[9:0]` simultaneously and compute the `next_state` and outputs accordingly.

### Design Considerations

- The module implements purely combinational logic for state transitions and output determinations.
- This specification does not include state flip-flop logic; it assumes the `state` input is externally managed.
- Edge cases such as multiple active states in `state[9:0]` are handled by computing transitions and outputs for each active state independently.
