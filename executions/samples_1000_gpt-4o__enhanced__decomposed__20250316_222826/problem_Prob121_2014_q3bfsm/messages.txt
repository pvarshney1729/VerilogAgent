Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1 bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `reset`: 1 bit, synchronous active high reset.\n  - `x`: 1 bit, control input.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `z`: 1 bit, output signal.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM).\n- The FSM uses a 3-bit state register `y[2:0]`, where `y[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `y[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Reset Behavior: \n  - The reset is synchronous and active high. When `reset` is asserted, the FSM transitions to the initial state `000` on the next positive edge of `clk`.\n- Clock Behavior:\n  - All sequential logic within the FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n\nState Transition Table:\n- Present State: `y[2:0]`\n- Next State with `x = 0`: \n  - `000` transitions to `000`\n  - `001` transitions to `001`\n  - `010` transitions to `010`\n  - `011` transitions to `001`\n  - `100` transitions to `011`\n- Next State with `x = 1`: \n  - `000` transitions to `001`\n  - `001` transitions to `100`\n  - `010` transitions to `001`\n  - `011` transitions to `010`\n  - `100` transitions to `100`\n- Output `z`:\n  - `z = 0` for states `000`, `001`, and `010`.\n  - `z = 1` for states `011` and `100`.\n\nInitial State:\n- On reset, the state is initialized to `000`.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure proper initialization on reset.\n- All transitions occur synchronously with the clock.\n\nNote: The FSM should be designed to avoid race conditions by ensuring all inputs are stable at the clock's positive edge.\n                    "
