  - output wire done: 1-bit, active high
  - output wire counting: 1-bit, active high
  - output wire shift_ena: 1-bit, active high

State Encoding:
- One-hot encoding is used for state representation:
  - S = 10'b0000000001
  - S1 = 10'b0000000010
  - S11 = 10'b0000000100
  - S110 = 10'b0000001000
  - B0 = 10'b0000010000
  - B1 = 10'b0000100000
  - B2 = 10'b0001000000
  - B3 = 10'b0010000000
  - Count = 10'b0100000000
  - Wait = 10'b1000000000

State Machine Description:
- The state machine is a Moore type with three inputs: d, done_counting, ack.
- The state machine outputs are: shift_ena, counting, done.
- By default, all outputs and state transitions assume a '0' value unless specified.

State Transitions (using one-hot encoding):
- From state S:
  - If d=0, remain in state S.
  - If d=1, transition to state S1.
- From state S1:
  - If d=0, transition to state S.
  - If d=1, transition to state S11.
- From state S11:
  - If d=0, transition to state S110.
  - If d=1, remain in state S11.
- From state S110:
  - If d=0, transition to state S.
  - If d=1, transition to state B0.
- From state B0:
  - Always transition to state B1.
- From state B1:
  - Always transition to state B2.
- From state B2:
  - Always transition to state B3.
- From state B3:
  - Always transition to state Count.
- From state Count:
  - If done_counting=0, remain in Count.
  - If done_counting=1, transition to Wait.
- From state Wait:
  - If ack=0, remain in Wait.
  - If ack=1, transition to S.

Reset Behavior:
- Upon reset, the state machine initializes to state S.

Output Logic:
- shift_ena is asserted (1) in states B0, B1, B2, and B3.
- counting is asserted (1) when in state Count.
- done is asserted (1) when in state Wait.

Next State Signal Assertions:
- B3_next is asserted when the next state is B3.
- S_next is asserted when the next state is S.
- S1_next is asserted when the next state is S1.
- Count_next is asserted when the next state is Count.
- Wait_next is asserted when the next state is Wait.

Combinational Logic:
- The module only includes state transition logic and output logic based on the combinational logic derived from the state transitions and outputs described above.
