Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal (1-bit). When asserted, all state registers are initialized to their idle state.\n  - `input in`: Serial data input (1-bit).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output done`: Signal (1-bit) indicating a complete and correct byte has been received.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode serial data transmitted using a protocol consisting of:\n  - 1 start bit (logic 0)\n  - 8 data bits transmitted least significant bit (LSB) first\n  - 1 stop bit (logic 1)\n\n- States:\n  1. **Idle**: Line is idle at logic 1.\n  2. **Start**: Detect the start bit (logic 0).\n  3. **Data**: Read 8 data bits sequentially.\n  4. **Stop**: Verify the stop bit (logic 1).\n  5. **Error**: Entered if the expected stop bit is not observed.\n\n- State Transitions:\n  - Transition from Idle to Start upon detecting a start bit (0).\n  - Transition from Start to Data after detecting a start bit.\n  - In the Data state, sequentially shift in 8 data bits.\n  - Transition from Data to Stop upon receiving 8 data bits.\n  - Transition from Stop to Idle if a correct stop bit is detected.\n  - Transition from Stop to Error if the stop bit is incorrect.\n  - Transition from Error to Idle upon detecting the next stop bit (logic 1).\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - On the assertion of the `reset` signal, return the FSM to the Idle state and clear any intermediate data storage.\n\n- Signal Behavior:\n  - `done` is asserted high for one clock cycle when a byte is successfully received and verified (correct start, data, and stop bits).\n\n- Edge Cases:\n  - If an incorrect stop bit is detected, the FSM waits in the Error state until a new stop bit is identified to resynchronize.\n  - The module does not handle framing errors or noise; it assumes ideal conditions apart from incorrect stop bits.\n\n- Bit Indexing:\n  - Bits are indexed from 0 to 7, with bit[0] being the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- All sequential logic elements must have explicitly defined initial values upon reset, typically set to a known state such as zero.\n\n- The FSM and its associated logic operate exclusively on the rising edge of the clock signal.\n                    "
