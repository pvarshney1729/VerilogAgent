Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal (1-bit). When asserted, all state registers are initialized to their idle state.
  - `input in`: Serial data input (1-bit).

- Output Ports:
  - `output done`: Signal (1-bit) indicating a complete and correct byte has been received.

Operational Details:
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode serial data transmitted using a protocol consisting of:
  - 1 start bit (logic 0)
  - 8 data bits transmitted least significant bit (LSB) first
  - 1 stop bit (logic 1)

- States:
  1. **Idle**: Line is idle at logic 1.
  2. **Start**: Detect the start bit (logic 0).
  3. **Data**: Read 8 data bits sequentially.
  4. **Stop**: Verify the stop bit (logic 1).
  5. **Error**: Entered if the expected stop bit is not observed.

- State Transitions:
  - Transition from Idle to Start upon detecting a start bit (0).
  - Transition from Start to Data after detecting a start bit.
  - In the Data state, sequentially shift in 8 data bits.
  - Transition from Data to Stop upon receiving 8 data bits.
  - Transition from Stop to Idle if a correct stop bit is detected.
  - Transition from Stop to Error if the stop bit is incorrect.
  - Transition from Error to Idle upon detecting the next stop bit (logic 1).

- Reset Behavior:
  - On the assertion of the `reset` signal, return the FSM to the Idle state and clear any intermediate data storage.

- Signal Behavior:
  - `done` is asserted high for one clock cycle when a byte is successfully received and verified (correct start, data, and stop bits).

- Edge Cases:
  - If an incorrect stop bit is detected, the FSM waits in the Error state until a new stop bit is identified to resynchronize.
  - The module does not handle framing errors or noise; it assumes ideal conditions apart from incorrect stop bits.

- Bit Indexing:
  - Bits are indexed from 0 to 7, with bit[0] being the least significant bit (LSB).

- All sequential logic elements must have explicitly defined initial values upon reset, typically set to a known state such as zero.

- The FSM and its associated logic operate exclusively on the rising edge of the clock signal.
