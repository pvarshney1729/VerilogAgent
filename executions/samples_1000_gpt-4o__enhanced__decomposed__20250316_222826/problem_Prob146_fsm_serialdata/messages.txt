        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1-bit, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `in`: Serial data input, 1-bit.\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset, 1-bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out_byte`: 8-bit data output. Valid when `done` is high.\n  - `done`: 1-bit flag, indicates a complete and correct byte has been received when high.\n\nGeneral Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol consisting of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The protocol sends data with the least significant bit (LSB) first.\n\nFSM Operation:\n1. Idle State: The FSM remains in this state while the line is high (logic 1) and transitions to the Start state upon detecting a low (logic 0) start bit.\n\n2. Start State: Upon detecting the start bit, the FSM transitions to the Data state to begin receiving the 8 data bits.\n\n3. Data State: The FSM sequentially shifts in each of the 8 data bits from the LSB to the most significant bit (MSB). This process occurs over 8 clock cycles.\n\n4. Stop State: After the 8 data bits have been received, the FSM checks for a high (logic 1) stop bit:\n   - If the stop bit is detected, `done` is asserted high for one clock cycle, and the byte is output on `out_byte`.\n   - If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM will continue checking for a correct stop bit before transitioning back to the Idle state.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On a synchronous reset (when `reset` is high), the FSM will return to the Idle state, `out_byte` is set to a don't-care value, and `done` is set to 0.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- The `out_byte` is valid only when `done` is high.\n- The data bits are received least significant bit first.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the start bit is not detected, the FSM remains in the Idle state.\n- The FSM ensures correct byte reception by verifying the presence of a valid start bit, 8 data bits, and a valid stop bit sequentially.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The module operates with sequential logic triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Line is at logic 1 when idle, and transitions to logic 0 to indicate the start bit.\n- The FSM is designed to handle continuous streams of serial data with no gaps between bytes.\n                    "
