Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1-bit, positive edge-triggered.
  - `in`: Serial data input, 1-bit.
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset, 1-bit.

- Output Ports:
  - `out_byte`: 8-bit data output. Valid when `done` is high.
  - `done`: 1-bit flag, indicates a complete and correct byte has been received when high.

General Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol consisting of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The protocol sends data with the least significant bit (LSB) first.

FSM Operation:
1. Idle State: The FSM remains in this state while the line is high (logic 1) and transitions to the Start state upon detecting a low (logic 0) start bit.

2. Start State: Upon detecting the start bit, the FSM transitions to the Data state to begin receiving the 8 data bits.

3. Data State: The FSM sequentially shifts in each of the 8 data bits from the LSB to the most significant bit (MSB). This process occurs over 8 clock cycles.

4. Stop State: After the 8 data bits have been received, the FSM checks for a high (logic 1) stop bit:
   - If the stop bit is detected, `done` is asserted high for one clock cycle, and the byte is output on `out_byte`.
   - If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM will continue checking for a correct stop bit before transitioning back to the Idle state.

Reset Behavior:
- On a synchronous reset (when `reset` is high), the FSM will return to the Idle state, `out_byte` is set to a don't-care value, and `done` is set to 0.

Signal Conventions:
- The `out_byte` is valid only when `done` is high.
- The data bits are received least significant bit first.
- Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit.

Edge Cases:
- If the start bit is not detected, the FSM remains in the Idle state.
- The FSM ensures correct byte reception by verifying the presence of a valid start bit, 8 data bits, and a valid stop bit sequentially.

Assumptions:
- The module operates with sequential logic triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
- Line is at logic 1 when idle, and transitions to logic 0 to indicate the start bit.
- The FSM is designed to handle continuous streams of serial data with no gaps between bytes.
