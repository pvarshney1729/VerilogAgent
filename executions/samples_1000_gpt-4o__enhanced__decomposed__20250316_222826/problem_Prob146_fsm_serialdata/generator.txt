To implement the `TopModule`, we will design a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a serial bit stream to extract bytes according to the specified protocol. The FSM will have the following states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP, and DONE. 

1. **IDLE State**: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0) to transition to the START state. The line is expected to be at logic 1 when idle.

2. **START State**: Once a start bit is detected, the FSM transitions to the DATA state to begin receiving the 8 data bits.

3. **DATA State**: The FSM shifts in each of the 8 data bits, starting from the least significant bit (LSB). A counter keeps track of the number of bits received.

4. **STOP State**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (logic 1). If the stop bit is detected, it transitions to the DONE state; otherwise, it waits for a valid stop bit.

5. **DONE State**: The FSM asserts the `done` signal to indicate a complete and correct byte has been received. The `out_byte` is valid in this state. The FSM then transitions back to the IDLE state.

The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize the state to IDLE. The `out_byte` is a don't-care value unless `done` is high. The design adheres to the coding conventions and guidelines provided.
