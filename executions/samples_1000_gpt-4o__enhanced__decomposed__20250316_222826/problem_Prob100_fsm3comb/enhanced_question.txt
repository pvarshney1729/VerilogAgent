Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [1:0] state`: 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).
- Outputs:
  - `output reg [1:0] next_state`: 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the MSB and bit[0] is the LSB.
  - `output reg out`: Single-bit output signal.

State Encoding:
- A = 2'b00
- B = 2'b01
- C = 2'b10
- D = 2'b11

State Transition Table and Output Logic:
- Current State: A (2'b00)
  - If `in` = 0, Next State = A (2'b00), Output = 0
  - If `in` = 1, Next State = B (2'b01), Output = 0
- Current State: B (2'b01)
  - If `in` = 0, Next State = C (2'b10), Output = 0
  - If `in` = 1, Next State = B (2'b01), Output = 0
- Current State: C (2'b10)
  - If `in` = 0, Next State = A (2'b00), Output = 0
  - If `in` = 1, Next State = D (2'b11), Output = 0
- Current State: D (2'b11)
  - If `in` = 0, Next State = C (2'b10), Output = 1
  - If `in` = 1, Next State = B (2'b01), Output = 1

Operational Details:
- The state transition and output determination are purely combinational, based on the current `state` and `in`.
- This module does not include clocked elements, thus no clock or reset signals are defined.
- Ensure that any race conditions or glitches are handled externally if necessary, as the module assumes stable input signals during operation.
