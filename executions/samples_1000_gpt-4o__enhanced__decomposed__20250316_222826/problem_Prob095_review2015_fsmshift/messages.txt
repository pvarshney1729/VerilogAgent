        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input. When asserted, it resets the FSM and related logic.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `shift_ena`: 1-bit output. Used to enable the shift register.\n\nOperational Overview:\n- The module is a part of a Finite State Machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.\n- The `shift_ena` output should be asserted (set to 1) for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles when a specific bit pattern is detected within the FSM (details of the pattern detection are assumed to be implemented within the FSM logic and are not specified here).\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon the assertion of `reset`, the FSM and all internal registers are reset to their initial state.\n- After reset is deasserted, `shift_ena` should be asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles and then remain deasserted (0) until the next reset or detection of the specific bit pattern.\n\nBit and Signal Conventions:\n- All signals are 1-bit wide unless explicitly stated.\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all ports and signals are single bits.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The FSM and any internal registers should be implemented using positive-edge triggered flip-flops.\n- All flip-flops and registers should have an explicitly defined initial value upon reset.\n\nEdge Cases and Additional Notes:\n- Ensure that any pattern detection logic within the FSM does not interfere with the reset sequence behavior.\n- The `shift_ena` output should return to 0 after the initial 4-cycle assertion post-reset, and remain 0 until another valid condition for enabling is met.\n                    "
