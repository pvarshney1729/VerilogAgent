<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles upon reset and then keep it deasserted until the next reset. The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the rising edge of the clock.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a simple counter to track the number of cycles `shift_ena` should be asserted. The counter will count from 4 down to 0.

2. **State Transition**: 
   - On reset, the counter is initialized to 4.
   - On each clock cycle, if the counter is non-zero, it decrements by 1.
   - When the counter reaches 0, `shift_ena` is deasserted.

3. **Output Logic**: 
   - `shift_ena` is asserted when the counter is greater than 0.
   - After the counter reaches 0, `shift_ena` remains deasserted until the next reset.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is incorporated within the clocked always block, ensuring that the reset is synchronous with the clock.

5. **Coding Conventions**: 
   - Use `logic` for all signals.
   - Use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.
   - Ensure numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module behaves as specified, asserting `shift_ena` for 4 cycles after a reset and maintaining a clean and efficient design.
