Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input. When asserted, it resets the FSM and related logic.

- Output Ports:
  - `shift_ena`: 1-bit output. Used to enable the shift register.

Operational Overview:
- The module is a part of a Finite State Machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.
- The `shift_ena` output should be asserted (set to 1) for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles when a specific bit pattern is detected within the FSM (details of the pattern detection are assumed to be implemented within the FSM logic and are not specified here).

Reset Behavior:
- Upon the assertion of `reset`, the FSM and all internal registers are reset to their initial state.
- After reset is deasserted, `shift_ena` should be asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles and then remain deasserted (0) until the next reset or detection of the specific bit pattern.

Bit and Signal Conventions:
- All signals are 1-bit wide unless explicitly stated.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all ports and signals are single bits.

Sequential Logic:
- The FSM and any internal registers should be implemented using positive-edge triggered flip-flops.
- All flip-flops and registers should have an explicitly defined initial value upon reset.

Edge Cases and Additional Notes:
- Ensure that any pattern detection logic within the FSM does not interfere with the reset sequence behavior.
- The `shift_ena` output should return to 0 after the initial 4-cycle assertion post-reset, and remain 0 until another valid condition for enabling is met.
