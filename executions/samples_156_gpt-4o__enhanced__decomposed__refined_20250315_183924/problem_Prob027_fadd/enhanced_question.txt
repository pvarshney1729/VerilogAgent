I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  cin
 - output cout
 - output sum

The module should impement a full adder. A full adder adds three bits
(including carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Port Widths and Signedness**: The specification states all ports are one bit unless otherwise specified, but it does not specify whether the bits are signed or unsigned. For a full adder, bits are typically unsigned.

2. **Bit-ordering**: There is no mention of bit-ordering conventions, which is not critical in this case due to single-bit inputs, but could be clarified for consistency.

3. **Timing Behavior**: The specification does not distinguish whether the full adder is intended to be combinational or sequential logic, though a full adder is typically combinational.

4. **Reset Behavior**: There is no mention of reset behavior, which is not applicable for combinational logic but should be stated explicitly.

5. **Initial States**: The specification does not specify initial states for outputs. However, in combinational logic, outputs are determined by inputs, so initial states are not applicable.

6. **Logical Descriptions**: The logical operation of the full adder is not explicitly described, which could lead to misunderstandings in implementation.

7. **Boundary Conditions**: The behavior for all possible input combinations is implicit but should be explicitly outlined to ensure completeness.

**Module Name**: TopModule

**Interface Specification**:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire a`: 1-bit, unsigned.
  - `input wire b`: 1-bit, unsigned.
  - `input wire cin`: 1-bit, unsigned (carry-in).

- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire cout`: 1-bit, unsigned (carry-out).
  - `output wire sum`: 1-bit, unsigned (sum of inputs).

**Behavioral Specification**:
- The module implements a combinational logic full adder, which computes the sum and carry-out of three 1-bit inputs: `a`, `b`, and `cin`.
- **Sum Calculation**: `sum = a XOR b XOR cin`
- **Carry-out Calculation**: `cout = (a AND b) OR (b AND cin) OR (a AND cin)`

**Timing and Reset Behavior**:
- The full adder operates as a combinational logic block, meaning that `cout` and `sum` are continuously determined by the current values of `a`, `b`, and `cin`.
- No reset functionality is required or applicable, as the logic is purely combinational.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Ensure that the module is synthesized to operate in a purely combinational manner, with no implied latches or registers.
- The full adder does not inherently require initialization, as outputs directly reflect input states.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- The module should correctly compute results for all 8 possible combinations of the inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`), as follows:
  - `000`: `sum = 0`, `cout = 0`
  - `001`: `sum = 1`, `cout = 0`
  - `010`: `sum = 1`, `cout = 0`
  - `011`: `sum = 0`, `cout = 1`
  - `100`: `sum = 1`, `cout = 0`
  - `101`: `sum = 0`, `cout = 1`
  - `110`: `sum = 0`, `cout = 1`
  - `111`: `sum = 1`, `cout = 1`

**Additional Notes**:
- Implement this module using standard Verilog syntax and practices to ensure compatibility with common synthesis tools.
