I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output out

The module should implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map
below.

              ab
   cd   00  01  11  10
   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                Module Specification for `TopModule`:

**Interface:**
- The module `TopModule` has the following ports:
  - `input wire a;`  // 1-bit wide, unsigned
  - `input wire b;`  // 1-bit wide, unsigned
  - `input wire c;`  // 1-bit wide, unsigned
  - `input wire d;`  // 1-bit wide, unsigned
  - `output wire out;`  // 1-bit wide, unsigned

**Behavior:**
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The output `out` is determined by the 4-bit input vector `{c, d, a, b}` using the following Karnaugh map interpretation:

```
              ab
   cd   00  01  11  10
   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
```

- The Karnaugh map is interpreted as follows:
  - For `cd = 00`, `out = 1` when `ab = 00, 01, 10`
  - For `cd = 01`, `out = 1` when `ab = 00, 10`
  - For `cd = 11`, `out = 1` when `ab = 01, 11, 10`
  - For `cd = 10`, `out = 1` when `ab = 00, 01`

**Timing:**
- The module operates using combinational logic, with no clock or reset signal required.

**Implementation Notes:**
- The output logic can be derived directly from the Karnaugh map using Boolean expressions, which can be minimized using standard techniques to optimize for gate count and propagation delay.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- All possible combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are accounted for in the Karnaugh map.

**Example Implementation:**
The following Boolean expression for `out` satisfies the Karnaugh map:
```
out = (!c & !d & (!a | b)) | (!c & d & !a) | (c & d & (b | !a)) | (c & !d & !b & !a)
```
where `!` denotes logical NOT, `&` denotes logical AND, and `|` denotes logical OR.
