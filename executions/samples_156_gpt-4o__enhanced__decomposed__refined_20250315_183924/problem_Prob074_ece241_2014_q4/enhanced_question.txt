I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  x
 - output z

The module should implement a finite state machine with the following
behavior. Input x goes to three different two-input gates: an XOR, an
AND, and a OR gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of
a D flip-flop and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input
NOR gate, whose output is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding
flip-flop's output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding
flip-flop's complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR
is its corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.

Assume that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the
machine begins. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive
edge of the clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Clarity and Naming:**
   - The specification refers to input `x` and output `z`, but does not specify if these names are case-sensitive or if any naming conventions are required.
   
2. **Port Widths and Signedness:**
   - While the specification mentions that all input and output ports are one bit, it does not explicitly state the bit-ordering or signedness (though implied to be unsigned due to single-bit width).

3. **Bit Indexing:**
   - No explicit mention of bit indexing conventions, though this is less critical given the single-bit nature.

4. **Timing Behavior:**
   - The specification does not distinguish between combinational and sequential logic beyond the positive edge trigger for flip-flops. It doesn't specify the clock's role explicitly in the FSM's operational cycle beyond triggering the flip-flops.
   
5. **Reset Behavior:**
   - The initial reset condition is vaguely mentioned without specifying whether the reset is synchronous or asynchronous. The reset state is defined as zero, but further clarification is needed.

6. **Initial State:**
   - It is assumed that the flip-flops are initialized to zero, but it should be explicitly stated how this is achieved (e.g., through a reset signal).

7. **Dependencies and Operation Precedence:**
   - There is no explicit mention of the order of operations within the clock cycle. It should be clarified how the input `x` interacts with the flip-flops before and after the clock edge.

8. **Logical Description:**
   - The specification provides a basic description of gate connections but lacks a formal description or visual representation (e.g., a truth table or state diagram) for better understanding.

9. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - There is no explicit handling of potential boundary conditions or unexpected scenarios, such as spurious clock edges or undefined input behavior.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Interface:**
- Module Name: `TopModule`
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk` : Positive edge-triggered clock signal.
  - `input wire x` : Single-bit input signal.
- Outputs:
  - `output wire z` : Single-bit output signal, resulting from the NOR operation.

**Behavior:**
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following logic:
  - The input `x` is fed into three different logic gates: XOR, AND, and OR.
  - Each gate's first input is `x` and the second input comes from the output of a corresponding D flip-flop:
    - XOR gate uses the output of its corresponding flip-flop.
    - AND gate uses the complemented output of its corresponding flip-flop.
    - OR gate uses the complemented output of its corresponding flip-flop.
  - The outputs of these gates feed into their respective D flip-flops.
  - The output of each flip-flop is then combined using a three-input NOR gate to produce the final output `z`.

**Timing and Reset Behavior:**
- **Clocking:**
  - The operation of the D flip-flops is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- **Reset:**
  - All D flip-flops are asynchronously reset to a logic '0' before normal operation begins. This reset ensures the initial state of the FSM is well-defined.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure proper synchronization of the reset signal with the clock to avoid metastability.
- The FSM should be designed keeping in mind synchronous design principles, with all state transitions occurring on the clock edge.
- The NOR gate output `z` will reflect the state as determined by the logic gates and flip-flops on each clock cycle.

**Additional Clarifications:**
- Input `x` must be stable for at least one clock period to ensure accurate sampling by the D flip-flops.
- The design should be verified against potential edge cases, such as when `x` remains constant or changes rapidly between clock edges.

This enhanced specification ensures all elements of the design are clearly defined, reducing ambiguity and potential implementation errors.
