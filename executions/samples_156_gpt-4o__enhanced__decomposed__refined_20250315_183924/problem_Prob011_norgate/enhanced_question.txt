I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output out

The module should implement a NOR gate.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Specification: TopModule

#### Interface
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Port Definitions**:
  - `input wire a` : 1-bit input signal, unsigned.
  - `input wire b` : 1-bit input signal, unsigned.
  - `output wire out` : 1-bit output signal, unsigned.

#### Behavioral Description
- **Functionality**: The module implements a two-input NOR gate.
- **Logic Operation**: The output `out` is the logical NOR of inputs `a` and `b`. Formally, this can be expressed as: 
  \[
  \text{out} = \overline{a + b}
  \]
  where `+` denotes logical OR and the overline denotes logical NOT.

#### Timing and Logical Considerations
- **Combinational Logic**: This module is purely combinational. There is no clock dependency or sequential logic involved.
- **Reset Behavior**: Not applicable, as the module does not include storage elements.

#### Implementation Notes
- **Truth Table**:
  \[
  \begin{array}{c|c|c}
  a & b & \text{out} \\
  \hline
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & 1 & 0 \\
  \end{array}
  \]
- **Boundary Conditions**: All possible combinations of inputs `a` and `b` (00, 01, 10, 11) are covered in the truth table.
- **Implementation Constraints**: Ensure the NOR operation is realized either via built-in logic gates or equivalent logic expression.

#### Coding Style
- Use meaningful comments to annotate the logic within the Verilog code.
- Maintain consistent indentation and naming conventions for readability.
