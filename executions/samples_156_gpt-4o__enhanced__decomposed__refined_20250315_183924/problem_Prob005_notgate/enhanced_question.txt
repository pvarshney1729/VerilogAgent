I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a NOT gate.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                Module Name: `TopModule`

### Interface Specification
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire in` : A 1-bit unsigned input signal.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire out` : A 1-bit unsigned output signal representing the logical NOT of the input.

### Bit-Ordering and Indexing
- All ports are single-bit and therefore do not require specific bit-ordering conventions. However, if expanded in the future, note that `bit[0]` would refer to the least significant bit (LSB).

### Timing Behavior
- This module implements combinational logic. The output `out` is directly dependent on the input `in` without any clock cycle delay.

### Reset Behavior
- This module does not incorporate any reset logic as it consists purely of combinational logic.

### Logical Description
- **Truth Table**:
  | `in` | `out` |
  |------|-------|
  |  0   |   1   |
  |  1   |   0   |

- **Equation**:
  - `out = ~in`

### Implementation Notes
- The module is a simple combinational circuit implementing a NOT gate, providing an inverted output of the input signal.
- Ensure that the design adheres to standard synthesis and simulation practices for combinational circuits.

### Boundary Conditions
- As a combinational NOT gate, there are no special boundary conditions to consider beyond standard logic inversion.

### Additional Considerations
- Keep the module flexible for potential expansion to handle wider buses by maintaining consistent naming and structural practices.
