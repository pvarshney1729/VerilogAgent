I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  d
 - input  done_counting
 - input  ack
 - input  state (10 bits)
 - output B3_next
 - output S_next
 - output S1_next
 - output Count_next
 - output Wait_next
 - output done
 - output counting
 - output shift_ena

The module should implement the following Moore state machine with 3
input (d, done_counting, ack) and 3 outputs (shift_ena, counting, done).
Unless otherwise stated in the diagram below, assume outputs are 0 and
inputs are don't cares.

state   (output)      --input--> next state
-------------------------------------------
  S     ()            --d=0--> S
  S     ()            --d=1--> S1
  S1    ()            --d=0--> S
  S1    ()            --d=1--> S11
  S11   ()            --d=0--> S110
  S11   ()            --d=1--> S11
  S110  ()            --d=0--> S
  S110  ()            --d=1--> B0
  B0    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> B1
  B1    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> B2
  B2    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> B3
  B3    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> Count
  Count (counting=1)  --done_counting=0--> Count
  Count (counting=1)  --done_counting=1--> Wait
  Wait  (done=1)      --ack=0--> Wait
  Wait  (done=1)      --ack=1--> S

At reset, the state machine starts in state "S". Derive next-state logic
equations and output logic equations by inspection assuming the following
one-hot encoding is used: (S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, Wait)
= (10'b0000000001, 10'b0000000010, 10'b0000000100, ... , 10'b1000000000)

Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming
a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output
logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine.

Write code that generates the following signals:

 - B3_next -- Assert when next-state is B3 state
 - S_next -- Assert when next-state is S state
 - S1_next -- Assert when next-state is S1 state
 - Count_next -- Assert when next-state is Count state
 - Wait_next -- Assert when next-state is Wait state
 - done -- output logic
 - counting -- output logic
 - shift_ena -- output logic

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Interface:

- **Module Name:** `TopModule`
- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire d`: 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire done_counting`: 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire ack`: 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [9:0] state`: 10-bit one-hot encoded state register.
- **Outputs:**
  - `output wire B3_next`: Asserted when the next state is B3.
  - `output wire S_next`: Asserted when the next state is S.
  - `output wire S1_next`: Asserted when the next state is S1.
  - `output wire Count_next`: Asserted when the next state is Count.
  - `output wire Wait_next`: Asserted when the next state is Wait.
  - `output wire done`: Logic high when in Wait state and `ack` is low.
  - `output wire counting`: Logic high when in Count state.
  - `output wire shift_ena`: Logic high in states B0, B1, B2, B3.

### Timing and Behavior:

- **Clocking and Reset:**
  - The module operates on the rising edge of a clock (not explicitly given, assumed required for FSM operation).
  - Reset is synchronous: On reset, the FSM transitions to the state `S` (state[0] = 1).

### State Transition Logic:

- **State Encoding (One-Hot):**
  - `S` = 10'b0000000001
  - `S1` = 10'b0000000010
  - `S11` = 10'b0000000100
  - `S110` = 10'b0000001000
  - `B0` = 10'b0000010000
  - `B1` = 10'b0000100000
  - `B2` = 10'b0001000000
  - `B3` = 10'b0010000000
  - `Count` = 10'b0100000000
  - `Wait` = 10'b1000000000

- **State Transition Table:**
  - `S`:
    - `d=0`: Remain in `S`
    - `d=1`: Move to `S1`
  - `S1`:
    - `d=0`: Move to `S`
    - `d=1`: Move to `S11`
  - `S11`:
    - `d=0`: Move to `S110`
    - `d=1`: Remain in `S11`
  - `S110`:
    - `d=0`: Move to `S`
    - `d=1`: Move to `B0`
  - `B0`: (shift_ena=1) Always move to `B1`
  - `B1`: (shift_ena=1) Always move to `B2`
  - `B2`: (shift_ena=1) Always move to `B3`
  - `B3`: (shift_ena=1) Always move to `Count`
  - `Count`: (counting=1)
    - `done_counting=0`: Remain in `Count`
    - `done_counting=1`: Move to `Wait`
  - `Wait`: (done=1)
    - `ack=0`: Remain in `Wait`
    - `ack=1`: Move to `S`

### Output Logic Descriptions:

- `B3_next = (state == B2)`
- `S_next = ((state == S) && (d == 0)) || ((state == S1) && (d == 0)) || ((state == S110) && (d == 0)) || ((state == Wait) && (ack == 1))`
- `S1_next = (state == S && d == 1)`
- `Count_next = (state == B3)`
- `Wait_next = (state == Count && done_counting == 1)`
- `done = (state == Wait)`
- `counting = (state == Count)`
- `shift_ena = (state == B0) || (state == B1) || (state == B2) || (state == B3)`

### Implementation Notes:

- Ensure all signals are reset to their appropriate states upon a synchronous reset.
- The `state` signal transitions should be based on a clock edge, with transitions determined by the combinational logic described.
- Care should be taken to ensure that signals like `done`, `counting`, and `shift_ena` are updated correctly in line with the state transitions.
