I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement the following circuit: A D flip-flop takes as
input the output of a two-input XOR. The flip-flop is positive edge
triggered by clk, but there is no reset. The XOR takes as input 'in'
along with the output 'out' of the flip-flop.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

**Module: TopModule**

**Interface:**
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,  // Clock signal, positive-edge triggered
    input wire in,   // Input signal, 1-bit, unsigned
    output wire out  // Output signal, 1-bit, unsigned
);
```

**Behavioral Description:**

- The module implements a simple sequential logic where a D flip-flop captures the result of a two-input XOR operation.
- The XOR gate computes the exclusive OR of the `in` signal and the current state of the `out` signal (feedback from the flip-flop).

**Timing Specifications:**

- The D flip-flop is positive edge-triggered on the `clk` signal.
- Ensure that the setup and hold times for the D flip-flop are met to avoid metastability.

**Reset and Initial State:**

- The flip-flop does not include an asynchronous or synchronous reset signal.
- To ensure predictable behavior post-synthesis or during simulation, assume the initial state of the flip-flop is '0'. This can be implemented using an initial block for simulation purposes if necessary, though real hardware might not support initial conditions without explicit reset logic.

**Operational Details:**

- The XOR operation is purely combinational and the output of this logic is fed directly into the D flip-flop.
- The `out` signal is effectively the state of the D flip-flop and reflects the previous XOR computation.

**Implementation Notes:**

- As the module involves a feedback loop, care should be taken to simulate the design thoroughly to ensure no race conditions occur under realistic operation scenarios.
- Consider potential issues with asynchronous inputs if `in` changes close to the clock edge; use synchronizers if needed in a larger system context.

**Boundary Conditions and Assumptions:**

- The circuit assumes an initial state of '0' for the `out` signal upon power-up.
- It is assumed that the input `in` is stable around the clock edge to avoid glitches in the XOR output.

```verilog
    reg q; // Internal D flip-flop state

    assign out = q;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= in ^ out; // XOR operation with feedback
    end
endmodule
```
