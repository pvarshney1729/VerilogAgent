I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  d   (8 bits)
 - output q   (8 bits)

The module should include 8 D flip-flops. All DFFs should be triggered by
the positive edge of clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

**Module Name: TopModule**

**1. Interface:**

- **Inputs:**
  - `input logic clk;`          // Clock signal, 1 bit, positive edge triggered.
  - `input logic [7:0] d;`      // Data input, 8 bits, unsigned.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output logic [7:0] q;`     // Data output, 8 bits, unsigned.

**2. Signal Conventions:**

- **Bit-Ordering:**
  - Bit indexing: `d[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB), `d[7]` to the most significant bit (MSB).

**3. Timing Behavior:**

- The module consists of 8 D flip-flops.
- Each D flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.

**4. Reset Behavior:**

- There is no synchronous or asynchronous reset specified. If initialization is required, consider adding:
  - `input logic rst_n;` // Asynchronous active-low reset.
- Upon the assertion of `rst_n`, `q` should be reset to `8'b00000000`.

**5. Initial States:**

- If a reset is added, `q` will be initialized to zero when `rst_n` is asserted.

**6. Functional Behavior:**

- On the rising edge of `clk`, each bit of `q` will be updated to reflect the corresponding bit of `d`.

**7. Dependencies and Operations:**

- The output `q` directly depends on the input `d` and the clock signal `clk`.

**8. Boundary Conditions:**

- Ensure `clk` does not change faster than the setup and hold times of the flip-flops to avoid metastability.
- Behavior on power-up is undefined without a reset; consider implementing a reset strategy.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the clock signal `clk` and any optional reset signal are stable and free of glitches.
- If additional functionality or integration with other modules is required, it may be necessary to revisit the design to include further specifications.
