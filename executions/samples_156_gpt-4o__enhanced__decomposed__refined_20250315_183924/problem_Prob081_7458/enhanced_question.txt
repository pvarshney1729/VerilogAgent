I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  p1a
 - input  p1b
 - input  p1c
 - input  p1d
 - input  p1e
 - input  p1f
 - input  p2a
 - input  p2b
 - input  p2c
 - input  p2d
 - output p1y
 - output p2y

The 7458 is a chip with four AND gates and two OR gates. Implement a
module with the same functionality as the 7458 chip. It has 10 inputs and
2 outputs. You may choose to use an `assign` statement to drive each of
the output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as
intermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of
one of the AND gates.

In this circuit, p1y should be the OR of two 3-input AND gates: one that
ANDs p1a, p1b, and p1c, and the second that ANDs p1d, p1e, and p1f. The
output p2y is the OR of two 2-input AND gates: one that ANDs p2a and p2b,
and the second that ANDs p2c and p2d.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Name: TopModule

#### Interface Specification
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire p1a;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p1b;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p1c;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p1d;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p1e;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p1f;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p2a;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p2b;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p2c;` // 1-bit input
  - `input wire p2d;` // 1-bit input

- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire p1y;` // 1-bit output, result of OR operation on two 3-input AND gates
  - `output wire p2y;` // 1-bit output, result of OR operation on two 2-input AND gates

#### Behavioral Specification
- **Output `p1y`**:
  - `p1y = (p1a AND p1b AND p1c) OR (p1d AND p1e AND p1f);`
  - This combines two 3-input AND gates using an OR gate.

- **Output `p2y`**:
  - `p2y = (p2a AND p2b) OR (p2c AND p2d);`
  - This combines two 2-input AND gates using an OR gate.

#### Timing Behavior
- The module implements purely combinational logic with no sequential elements. There are no clock or reset signals involved.

#### Implementation Notes
- The design is intended to replicate the functionality of a 7458 chip with four AND gates and two OR gates.
- Intermediate wires may be used to represent the outputs of individual AND gates if desired for clarity or structural purposes.
- Use of `assign` statements is recommended to express the combinational logic directly.

#### Formal Representation
- **Boolean Equations**:
  - `p1y = (p1a & p1b & p1c) | (p1d & p1e & p1f);`
  - `p2y = (p2a & p2b) | (p2c & p2d);`

#### Edge Cases and Assumptions
- Given that all inputs are single-bit, boundary conditions are implicitly handled by the AND and OR operations.
- All inputs and outputs are assumed to be active-high unless specified otherwise.
