I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - output out

The module should always drive 0 (or logic low).

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module: TopModule

#### Interface
- **Ports:**
  - `output logic out`: A 1-bit output port. The signal is named `out` for simplicity, as it is intended to output a constant logic level.

#### Behavior
- **Functional Description:**
  - The `TopModule` continuously drives its output port `out` to a logic level of 0 (logic low).

#### Timing Behavior
- **Combinational Logic:**
  - The `out` signal is driven directly by combinational logic. There are no clock dependencies or sequential elements involved.

#### Reset Behavior
- **Reset Requirements:**
  - No reset is required as the output is continuously driven by combinational logic. The module does not contain any state-holding elements that require initialization.

#### Implementation Notes
- **Synthesis Considerations:**
  - Ensure that the synthesis tool recognizes the constant output and optimizes it accordingly.
  
- **Port Naming and Width:**
  - The output port `out` is defined as a 1-bit wide, unsigned logic signal. This is consistent with the naming convention of being a simple output.

#### Example Instantiation
```verilog
TopModule top_inst (
    .out(out_signal)
);
```

This example shows how to instantiate the `TopModule` within a higher-level module or testbench environment.
