I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  x
 - output z

The module should implement the following Mealy finite-state machine
which is an implementation of the 2's complementer. Implement using a
one-hot encoding. Resets into state A and reset is asynchronous
active-high.

  A --x=0 (z=0)--> A
  A --x=1 (z=1)--> B
  B --x=0 (z=1)--> B
  B --x=1 (z=0)--> B

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                #### Module Interface:
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,       // Clock signal, positive edge-triggered
    input wire areset,    // Asynchronous active-high reset
    input wire x,         // Input signal
    output reg z          // Output signal
);
```

#### Behavior:
- **State Encoding:**
  - State A is encoded as `2'b01` in a one-hot encoding scheme.
  - State B is encoded as `2'b10`.

- **State Transition and Output Logic:**
  - **State A:** 
    - If `x == 0`, remain in State A, `z = 0`.
    - If `x == 1`, transition to State B, `z = 1`.
  - **State B:**
    - If `x == 0`, remain in State B, `z = 1`.
    - If `x == 1`, remain in State B, `z = 0`.

#### Timing Behavior:
- The state transitions and output logic are evaluated on the rising edge of the `clk`.
- The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous. When `areset` is high, the state machine resets to State A immediately, regardless of the clock edge.

#### Reset and Initial States:
- Upon activation of `areset`, the state is set to A (`2'b01`), and `z` is set to `0`.
- After release from `areset`, the state machine resumes normal operation on the next positive edge of `clk`.

#### Implementation Notes:
- The module uses a one-hot encoding for state representation, ensuring efficient state transitions and minimizing decoding logic.
- Ensure all synthesizable constructs are utilized, and consider potential synthesis optimization settings that might affect one-hot encoding.

#### Boundary Conditions:
- The state machine is fully defined for the given states and inputs; however, any state not explicitly defined in the one-hot encoding is considered unreachable and should be handled as a design error if encountered.
