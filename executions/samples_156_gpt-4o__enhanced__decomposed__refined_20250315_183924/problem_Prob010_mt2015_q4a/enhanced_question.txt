I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output z

The module should implement the boolean function z = (x^y) & x.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Specification for `TopModule`

#### Interface
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Port Definitions**:
  - **Inputs**:
    - `input wire x`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
    - `input wire y`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - **Outputs**:
    - `output wire z`: 1-bit output, unsigned.

#### Naming Conventions
- Port names `x`, `y`, and `z` are chosen for simplicity and should be replaced with context-specific names if integrated into a larger design to avoid naming conflicts.

#### Behavior
- **Functionality**: The module implements a combinational logic function defined as:
  - `z = (x XOR y) AND x`
  - Here, `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation and `&` denotes the bitwise AND operation.

#### Timing and Reset Behavior
- **Combinational Logic**: The module is purely combinational with no clocked elements. There are no timing dependencies on any clock signal.
- **Reset Behavior**: Not applicable as there are no state-holding elements.

#### Initial States
- The module does not contain any registers or flip-flops, so initial states are not applicable.

#### Bit-ordering and Indexing
- As the module handles single-bit signals, bit-ordering and indexing are not applicable, but the convention is that the single bit is considered as bit[0].

#### Dependencies and Precedence
- Operation precedence follows standard boolean algebra without additional dependencies or race conditions.

#### Edge Cases
- Given the 1-bit nature of inputs `x` and `y`, edge cases are inherently covered by the truth table of the XOR and AND operations:
  - `x = 0, y = 0` results in `z = 0`
  - `x = 0, y = 1` results in `z = 0`
  - `x = 1, y = 0` results in `z = 1`
  - `x = 1, y = 1` results in `z = 0`

### Verilog Implementation
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire x,
    input wire y,
    output wire z
);
    assign z = (x ^ y) & x;
endmodule
```
