I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  y (6 bits)
 - input  w
 - output Y1
 - output Y3

Consider the state machine shown below:

  A (0) --0--> B
  A (0) --1--> A
  B (0) --0--> C
  B (0) --1--> D
  C (0) --0--> E
  C (0) --1--> D
  D (0) --0--> F
  D (0) --1--> A
  E (1) --0--> E
  E (1) --1--> D
  F (1) --0--> C
  F (1) --1--> D

Resets into state A. For this part, assume that a one-hot code is used
with the state assignment y[5:0] = 000001, 000010, 000100, 001000,
010000, 100000 for states A, B,..., F, respectively.

The module shou module ment the next-state signals Y2 and Y4
corresponding to signal y[1] and y[3]. Derive the logic equations by
inspection assuming the one-hot encoding.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                Specification for Verilog Module: TopModule

**Interface:**
- Inputs:
  - `y`: 6-bit input vector representing the one-hot encoded current state.
    - `y[5:0]` with `y[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `w`: 1-bit input signal for state transition control.
- Outputs:
  - `Y1`: 1-bit output indicating a specific output condition (to be defined).
  - `Y3`: 1-bit output indicating another specific output condition (to be defined).
  - `Y2`: 1-bit output derived from next-state logic for `y[1]`.
  - `Y4`: 1-bit output derived from next-state logic for `y[3]`.

**State Encoding:**
- One-hot encoding is used with the following assignments:
  - State A: `y[5:0] = 000001`
  - State B: `y[5:0] = 000010`
  - State C: `y[5:0] = 000100`
  - State D: `y[5:0] = 001000`
  - State E: `y[5:0] = 010000`
  - State F: `y[5:0] = 100000`

**State Machine Description:**
- Transition Conditions:
  - From State A:
    - `w = 0`: Transition to State B
    - `w = 1`: Remain in State A
  - From State B:
    - `w = 0`: Transition to State C
    - `w = 1`: Transition to State D
  - From State C:
    - `w = 0`: Transition to State E
    - `w = 1`: Transition to State D
  - From State D:
    - `w = 0`: Transition to State F
    - `w = 1`: Transition to State A
  - From State E:
    - `w = 0`: Remain in State E
    - `w = 1`: Transition to State D
  - From State F:
    - `w = 0`: Transition to State C
    - `w = 1`: Transition to State D

**Reset Behavior:**
- The module includes a synchronous reset that initializes the state machine to State A (`y[5:0] = 000001`).

**Output Logic:**
- Derive Y2 and Y4 based on next-state transitions:
  - `Y2`: Logic equation for the next-state transition affecting `y[1]`.
  - `Y4`: Logic equation for the next-state transition affecting `y[3]`.

**Timing Behavior:**
- All state transitions and output updates occur on the rising edge of a clock signal (not explicitly mentioned but assumed necessary for sequential logic).

**Initial States:**
- All flip-flops and registers should initialize to their respective state as per the reset behavior.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The module should handle all valid one-hot encoded states and transition appropriately based on the input `w`.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure all logic equations are minimized for efficient hardware synthesis.
- Validate the state machine transitions through simulation to ensure correctness.
