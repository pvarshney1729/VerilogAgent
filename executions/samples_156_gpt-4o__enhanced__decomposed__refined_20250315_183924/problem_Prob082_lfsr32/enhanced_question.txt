I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement that shifts right, where a bit position with
a "tap" is XORed with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value,
while bit positions without a tap shift right unchanged. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit
positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. Reset should be active high synchronous, and
should reset the output q to 32'h1. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ```
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,         // Clock signal, positive edge triggered
    input wire reset,       // Active high synchronous reset
    output reg [31:0] q     // 32-bit output, unsigned
);

// Interface Specification:
// - `clk`: Clock input, positive edge triggered.
// - `reset`: Synchronous reset input, active high.
// - `q`: 32-bit output, initialized to 32'h1 on reset. Unsigned integer.

// Bit Indexing and Ordering:
// - Bit indexing is zero-based, with q[0] as the least significant bit (LSB) and q[31] as the most significant bit (MSB).

// Reset Behavior:
// - On reset (reset=1), `q` will be set to 32'h1 synchronously with the clock.
// - Reset is applied on the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.

// Initial State:
// - Upon power-up, if reset is not asserted, the initial state of `q` is indeterminate until the first reset.

// LFSR Galois Implementation:
// - The LFSR shifts right on each rising edge of the clock.
// - Taps are applied on bits 31 (MSB), 21, 1, and 0.
// - The next state of bit `q[31]` is computed as the XOR of `q[0]` with the current states of the tapped bits.
// - Non-tapped bits shift right without modification.

// Sequential Logic:
// - The LFSR operates on the rising edge of `clk`.
// - `q` updates to its next state on each clock cycle, except during reset.

// Boundary Conditions:
// - No specific boundary condition for maximum count as LFSR cycles through states determined by tap configuration.

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 32'h1;  // Reset state
    end else begin
        // LFSR Galois operation
        q <= {q[30:0], q[0] ^ q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1]}; // Shift right with XOR taps
    end
end

endmodule
```
