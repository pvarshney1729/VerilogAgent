I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in1
 - input  in2
 - input  in3
 - output out

The module should impement the following circuit: A two-input XNOR
(connected to 'in1' and 'in2) has an output connected to the input of a
two-input XOR. The second input of the XOR is 'in3.' The output of the
XOR is 'out'.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                Module Name: TopModule

**Interface Definition:**
- `input wire in1` : 1-bit input signal.
- `input wire in2` : 1-bit input signal.
- `input wire in3` : 1-bit input signal.
- `output wire out` : 1-bit output signal.

**Bit-ordering Convention:**
- All signals are 1-bit wide, therefore bit-ordering is not applicable.

**Behavioral Specification:**
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- A two-input XNOR gate is connected to inputs `in1` and `in2`. The formal logic expression for XNOR is: 
  \[
  xnor\_out = in1 \oplus \lnot in2
  \]
  where \(\oplus\) denotes the XNOR operation.
- The output of the XNOR (`xnor_out`) is connected to the first input of a two-input XOR gate.
- The second input of the XOR gate is `in3`.
- The output of the XOR gate, which is the module output `out`, is defined by:
  \[
  out = xnor\_out \oplus in3
  \]

**Timing Behavior:**
- This module is a purely combinational circuit with no sequential elements. All outputs are directly affected by the current inputs without any clock dependencies.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure that the XNOR operation is evaluated before the XOR operation to maintain the correct logical sequence.
- All logical operations are level-sensitive and should propagate changes instantaneously within the simulation environment, adhering to standard Verilog simulation semantics.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Given the 1-bit nature of all inputs, all possible input combinations (000 to 111) are valid and must be handled by the logic as specified.
