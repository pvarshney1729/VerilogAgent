I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  x (4 bits)
 - output f

The module should implement the function f shown in the Karnaugh map
below.

             x[0]x[1]
x[2]x[3]  00  01  11  10
  00     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  10     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                #### Module Interface:

- **Module Name**: `TopLogicFunction`
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire [3:0] x`  // 4-bit input vector, `x[3]` is MSB, `x[0]` is LSB.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire f`  // 1-bit unsigned output.

#### Functional Description:

The module implements a combinational logic function `f` based on the given Karnaugh map. The input `x` is a 4-bit vector, where `x[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `x[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

#### Karnaugh Map:

The function `f` is defined by the following Karnaugh map:

```
             x[1]x[0]
x[3]x[2]  00  01  11  10
  00     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  10     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
```

- The output `f` is `1` for the following combinations of `x`: 
  - `x = 4'b0000`
  - `x = 4'b0011`
  - `x = 4'b0111`
  - `x = 4'b1110`
  - `x = 4'b1010`
  - `x = 4'b1000`
  - `x = 4'b1001`

- For all other combinations of `x`, the output `f` is `0`.

#### Timing and Reset:

- **Timing**: The logic is purely combinational with no clock or reset signals; the output `f` changes immediately with input `x`.
- **Reset**: Not applicable as there is no sequential logic involved.

#### Implementation Notes:

- Ensure the logic implementation correctly reflects the combinational nature of the Karnaugh map.
- Test the module with all possible values of `x` (from `4'b0000` to `4'b1111`) to ensure correct functionality.
