I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in1
 - input  in2
 - output out

The module should implement the following circuit in Verilog. Two inputs
(in1 and in2) go to an AND gate, but the in2 input to the AND gate has a
bubble. The output of the AND gate is connected to 'out'.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Interfaces:**
   - The specification states all ports are one bit unless otherwise specified, but it does not explicitly confirm the bit-width of each port. Clarification is needed for consistency.

2. **Bit-ordering and Naming Conventions:**
   - The specification does not mention any specific naming or indexing conventions, though it's not critical in a one-bit context; clarity helps maintain consistency in larger designs.

3. **Timing Behavior:**
   - The specification does not clarify if the circuit is intended to be purely combinational or if there are any sequential elements involved.

4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - As the module seems purely combinational, reset behavior is not applicable, but this should be confirmed or noted explicitly.

5. **Initial States:**
   - Initial states are not applicable here since it is described as a combinational logic circuit, but a note should confirm this.

6. **Logical Description:**
   - The description of the logic could be made clearer using standard logic gate terminology, such as inverting the signal instead of using "a bubble."

7. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The module's behavior for all possible input combinations should be explicitly stated, though in this simple logic gate, it's assumed to be covered.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Interface:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in1,  // Single-bit input
    input wire in2,  // Single-bit input, active-low due to bubble
    output wire out  // Single-bit output
);
```

- **Signal Descriptions:**
  - `in1`: A single-bit input signal.
  - `in2`: A single-bit input signal, which is inverted before entering the AND gate (indicated by the "bubble").
  - `out`: A single-bit output signal, representing the result of the logic operation.

**Behavior:**

- **Logic Circuit Description:**
  - The module implements a combinational logic circuit with AND functionality.
  - The AND gate receives `in1` directly and the inverted form of `in2` (active-low), producing `out` as the logical AND of `in1` and `~in2`.

- **Logical Operation:**
  - `out = in1 AND NOT in2`
  - This can be expressed as `out = in1 & ~in2`.

**Timing Behavior:**

- The circuit is purely combinational with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.

**Implementation Notes:**

- **Bit-ordering:** 
  - Not applicable for single-bit signals but clearly defined for potential expansion.
  
- **Reset Behavior:**
  - Not required as the module is purely combinational with no state-holding elements.

- **Initial States:**
  - Not applicable due to the absence of sequential elements or state dependencies.

```verilog
assign out = in1 & ~in2;
endmodule
```

**Boundary Conditions:**

- The behavior for all possible input states (`00`, `01`, `10`, `11`) is defined by the logical operation, producing outputs `1`, `1`, `0`, `0` respectively.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

This enhanced specification clarifies the design intent, ensures consistency, and explicitly describes the logic and behavior, maintaining correctness in implementation.
