I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output q
 - output state

The module should implement a sequential circuit. The circuit consists of
combinational logic and one bit of memory (i.e., one flip-flop). The
output of the flip-flop has been made observable through the output
state. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

Read the simulation waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then
implement it.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Enhanced Specification for `TopModule`

#### Module Interface:
- **Module Name:** `TopModule`
- **Inputs:**
  - `input logic clk` : Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input logic a` : Input signal `a`, 1-bit unsigned.
  - `input logic b` : Input signal `b`, 1-bit unsigned.
- **Outputs:**
  - `output logic q` : Output signal `q`, 1-bit unsigned.
  - `output logic state` : Output signal representing the state of the flip-flop, 1-bit unsigned.

#### Behavior and Logic Description:
- **Sequential Logic:**
  - The module contains one flip-flop, which updates its state on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
  - The output `state` reflects the current state of the flip-flop.
  - The logic for updating the flip-flop state is determined by the current values of `a` and `b` and the previous state.
  
- **Combinational Logic:**
  - The output `q` is determined combinatorially based on inputs `a`, `b`, and the current `state`.

#### Timing Behavior:
- **Clocking:**
  - The flip-flop updates its state on the rising edge of `clk`.
- **Outputs:**
  - `state` is updated synchronously with `clk`.
  - `q` is a combinational output derived from the current state and inputs.

#### Reset Behavior:
- **Initial State:**
  - The flip-flop should be initialized to '0' at the start of operation.
  - The reset mechanism, if needed, should be synchronous with the clock.

#### Implementation Notes:
- **Logic Function:**
  - The logic inferred from the simulation waveforms is as follows:
    - If `a` and `b` are both '1', `state` toggles.
    - If only `b` is '1', `state` is set to '0'.
    - `q` follows the current `state`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Simultaneous changes in `a` and `b` should be handled by the sequential logic according to the described logic function.

#### Simulation Waveform Analysis:
- The behavior of the circuit is consistent with the simulation waveform provided, ensuring the correct operation of the flip-flop and logic under the specified conditions.
