Module A implements the boolean function z = (x^y) & x.

Module B can be described by the following simulation waveform:

  time  x  y  z
  0ns   0  0  1
  5ns   0  0  1
  10ns  0  0  1
  15ns  0  0  1
  20ns  0  0  1
  25ns  1  0  0
  30ns  1  0  0
  35ns  0  1  0
  40ns  0  1  0
  45ns  1  1  1
  50ns  1  1  1
  55ns  0  0  1
  60ns  0  1  0
  65ns  0  1  0
  70ns  1  1  1
  75ns  0  1  0
  80ns  0  1  0
  85ns  0  1  0
  90ns  1  0  0

Now consider a top-level module with the following interface:

 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output z

The module is implemented with two A submodules and two B submodules. The
first input of all four submodules is connect to input 'x', and the
second input of all four submodules is connected to 'y'. The output of
the first A submodule is connected to a two-input OR, along with the
output of the first B submodule. The second pair of A and B submodules is
similarly connected to an AND gate. The output of the OR and the AND is
connected to an XOR, whose output is 'z'.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Interfaces:**
   - The bit-width and signedness of inputs (`x`, `y`) and output (`z`) are not specified.
   - Naming conventions for inputs and outputs are not standardized.

2. **Bit-ordering:**
   - There is no mention of bit-ordering or indexing, although it may not be necessary if `x`, `y`, and `z` are single-bit signals.

3. **Timing Behavior:**
   - There is no explicit distinction between combinational and sequential logic for Modules A and B.
   - The timing diagram for Module B suggests a sequence of events, but it is unclear if they represent clock cycles or just time points.

4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - There is no specification of reset behavior for any sequential elements, if they exist.

5. **Initial States:**
   - Initial states for any registers or flip-flops are not defined.

6. **Dependencies and Logical Descriptions:**
   - The specification of Module A's function `z = (x^y) & x` is not detailed in terms of logic levels for `x` and `y`.
   - Module B's behavior is only described via a waveform without a clear logical function or state machine description.

7. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The behavior for all possible input combinations is not exhaustively described.
   - No information is provided on how the system should handle inputs at the boundaries of their operating conditions.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Interface:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `input logic x; // Single-bit input, logic level signal`
  - `input logic y; // Single-bit input, logic level signal`
- **Output:**
  - `output logic z; // Single-bit output, logic level signal`

**Module A Specification:**
- **Functionality:** Implements the boolean function `z = (x ^ y) & x`.
- **Logic Description:** For each input combination:
  - When `x = 0` and `y = 0`, `z = 0`.
  - When `x = 0` and `y = 1`, `z = 0`.
  - When `x = 1` and `y = 0`, `z = 1`.
  - When `x = 1` and `y = 1`, `z = 0`.
- **Bit-ordering:** Not applicable as signals are single-bit.

**Module B Specification:**
- **Functionality:** Described by the simulation waveform. Cycle-based operation is implicit.
- **Timing Behavior:** The waveform specifies output `z` at discrete time points; assume these represent clock cycles.
- **Logic Description:** The waveform suggests a dependence on past states, possibly requiring a state machine.
  - Use a D flip-flop to capture the state of `z` at each time step based on inputs `x` and `y`.

**Top-Level Module Specification:**
- **Submodule Connections:**
  - All submodules A1, A2, B1, and B2 receive the same inputs `x` and `y`.
  - Outputs:
    - `A1_out = A1(x, y);`
    - `B1_out = B1(x, y);`
    - `A2_out = A2(x, y);`
    - `B2_out = B2(x, y);`
  - OR gate: `or_gate_out = A1_out | B1_out;`
  - AND gate: `and_gate_out = A2_out & B2_out;`
  - Final XOR: `z = or_gate_out ^ and_gate_out;`

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Combinational Logic:** All gates (OR, AND, XOR) are combinational.
- **Sequential Logic:** Module B may require clocked operation due to the specified waveform; assume a clock signal if necessary.
- **Reset Behavior:** Include synchronous reset for any state elements within Module B, defaulting states to zero if unspecified.
- **Initial States:** Initialize all flip-flops to zero unless otherwise specified.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Ensure correct operation when `x` and `y` transition simultaneously.
- Confirm behavior when inputs remain constant over multiple cycles.

**Timing and Clocks:**
- Assume a default clock cycle of 5ns for Module B's operation based on provided waveform.

**Simulation and Verification:**
- Verify the implementation against the waveform for Module B and logical expressions for Module A to ensure correctness.
