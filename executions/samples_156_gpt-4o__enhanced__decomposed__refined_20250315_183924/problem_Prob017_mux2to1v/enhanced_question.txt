I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a   (100 bits)
 - input  b   (100 bits)
 - input  sel
 - output out (100 bits)

The module should implement a 2-1 multiplexer. When sel=0, choose a. When
sel=1, choose b.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name**: `TopModule`

**Interface Definition**:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input [99:0] a`: A 100-bit wide bus, unsigned. Bit index 0 represents the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `input [99:0] b`: A 100-bit wide bus, unsigned. Bit index 0 represents the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `input sel`: A 1-bit control signal. Unsigned. This signal selects the data path for the output.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - `output [99:0] out`: A 100-bit wide bus, unsigned. Bit index 0 represents the least significant bit (LSB).

**Behavior**:
- **Functional Description**: The module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer. The output `out` is determined by the `sel` input as follows:
  - If `sel` is `0`, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.
  - If `sel` is `1`, `out` is assigned the value of `b`.

- **Formal Logic Description**:
  - `out = (sel == 0) ? a : b;`

**Timing**:
- **Combinational Logic**: The module operates as a purely combinational circuit without any clock dependencies. Changes in inputs `a`, `b`, or `sel` immediately reflect in the output `out`.

**Reset Behavior**:
- **Not Applicable**: As this is a combinational logic module, no reset behavior is applicable or required.

**Initial States**:
- **Not Applicable**: Since this module is purely combinational, initial states are not defined or necessary.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- The module's behavior is well-defined for all possible binary values of `sel` (0 or 1). No additional conditions or edge cases are present beyond the specified behavior.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Ensure synthesis tools optimize the logic for minimum delay, as the design is purely combinational.
- Carefully consider the propagation delay through the multiplexer when integrating this module into larger designs to ensure timing closure.
