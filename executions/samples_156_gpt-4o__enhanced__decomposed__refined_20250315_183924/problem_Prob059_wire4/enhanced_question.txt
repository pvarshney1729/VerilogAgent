I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - output w
 - output x
 - output y
 - output z

The module should behave like wires that makes these connections:

  a -> w
  b -> x
  b -> y
  c -> z

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

**Module: TopModule**

**Interface:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire a; // 1-bit input signal`
  - `input wire b; // 1-bit input signal`
  - `input wire c; // 1-bit input signal`
- **Outputs:**
  - `output wire w; // 1-bit output signal, directly driven by input 'a'`
  - `output wire x; // 1-bit output signal, directly driven by input 'b'`
  - `output wire y; // 1-bit output signal, directly driven by input 'b'`
  - `output wire z; // 1-bit output signal, directly driven by input 'c'`

**Behavior:**
- The module acts as a combinational logic circuit with direct wire connections from inputs to outputs.
- The connections are as follows:
  - `a` drives output `w`
  - `b` drives outputs `x` and `y`
  - `c` drives output `z`

**Timing:**
- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clocked elements or sequential logic. There is no dependency on clock edges or cycles.

**Reset and Initial States:**
- Since the module is combinational, no reset behavior or initial states are required.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure that the connections are direct and no additional logic is introduced.
- Bit-ordering is trivial in this context due to single-bit signals, but for multi-bit extensions, ensure `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The design should function correctly for all possible input combinations of the single-bit inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`.

**Verilog Implementation:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire a,
  input wire b,
  input wire c,
  output wire w,
  output wire x,
  output wire y,
  output wire z
);

  // Direct connections
  assign w = a;
  assign x = b;
  assign y = b;
  assign z = c;

endmodule
```
