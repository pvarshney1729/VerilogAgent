I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  p1a
 - input  p1b
 - input  p1c
 - input  p1d
 - input  p2a
 - input  p2b
 - input  p2c
 - input  p2d
 - output p1y
 - output p2y

The 7400-series integrated circuits are a series of digital chips with a
few gates each. The 7420 is a chip with two 4-input NAND gates. The
module should implement the same functionality as the 7420 chip.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module: TopModule

#### Interface Specification:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire p1a` : 1-bit unsigned input.
  - `input wire p1b` : 1-bit unsigned input.
  - `input wire p1c` : 1-bit unsigned input.
  - `input wire p1d` : 1-bit unsigned input.
  - `input wire p2a` : 1-bit unsigned input.
  - `input wire p2b` : 1-bit unsigned input.
  - `input wire p2c` : 1-bit unsigned input.
  - `input wire p2d` : 1-bit unsigned input.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire p1y` : 1-bit unsigned output representing the result of a 4-input NAND operation on `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d`.
  - `output wire p2y` : 1-bit unsigned output representing the result of a 4-input NAND operation on `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d`.

#### Functional Behavior:
- The module `TopModule` implements the functionality of the 7420 chip, which consists of two independent 4-input NAND gates.
- **Logic Equations**:
  - `p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d)` : The output `p1y` is the NAND result of inputs `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d`.
  - `p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d)` : The output `p2y` is the NAND result of inputs `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d`.

#### Timing Behavior:
- The module is purely combinational with no internal state or sequential logic elements, meaning outputs update immediately based on input changes without any clock dependency.

#### Reset Behavior:
- As this is a combinational logic module, no reset functionality is required or implemented.

#### Implementation Notes:
- The NAND gate functionality is inherently defined by the logic equations provided.
- Ensure that all inputs are stable for accurate output determination, though typical digital logic signal stability issues (such as glitches) should be managed at a system level.

#### Boundary Conditions:
- The 4-input NAND gate will output a logical high (`1`) if any input is low (`0`), and will output a logical low (`0`) only if all inputs are high (`1`).
