I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a Moore state machine with the following
state transition table with one input, one output, and four states.
Implement this state machine. Include a positive edge triggered
asynchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

  state | next state in=0, next state in=1 | output
  A     | A, B                             | 0
  B     | C, B                             | 0
  C     | A, D                             | 0
  D     | C, B                             | 1

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Enhanced Specification for TopModule

#### Interface Definition
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input wire areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high.
  - `input wire in`: Data input signal, 1-bit.

- **Outputs**:
  - `output reg out`: Data output signal, 1-bit.

#### State Machine Definition
- **States**: Four states are defined with the following binary encoding:
  - State A: `2'b00`
  - State B: `2'b01`
  - State C: `2'b10`
  - State D: `2'b11`

- **State Transition Table**:
  - | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
    |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
    | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |
    | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |
    | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |
    | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |

#### Behavior
- **Initial State**: The FSM initializes to state A (`2'b00`) upon reset.
- **Reset Behavior**: The `areset` is asynchronous and active high, resetting the FSM to state A regardless of the clock.
- **Timing**: State transitions and output logic are evaluated on the positive edge of the `clk`.

#### Implementation Notes
- The asynchronous reset (`areset`) is level-sensitive. When `areset` is high, the FSM transitions immediately to state A.
- Ensure all sequential elements are initialized to known states, specifically state A, upon reset.
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine design principles.

#### Edge Case Handling
- During the assertion of the `areset`, all other signals are ignored until the reset is deasserted.

This enhanced specification ensures that all aspects of the design are clearly defined, reducing the risk of misinterpretation during implementation.
