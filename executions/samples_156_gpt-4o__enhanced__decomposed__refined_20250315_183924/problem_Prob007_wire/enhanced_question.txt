I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in
 - output out

The module should behave like a wire.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name**: `TopModule`

**Interface**:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire in_bit`: A 1-bit input signal. Explicitly defined as a wire and assumed to be unsigned, as this is typical for single-bit signals.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire out_bit`: A 1-bit output signal. Explicitly defined as a wire and assumed to be unsigned.

**Behavior**:
- The module `TopModule` implements a direct connection, behaving like a wire.
- The output `out_bit` directly follows the input `in_bit` with no delay, implying combinational logic.

**Timing Behavior**:
- This is a combinational module with no sequential logic elements. There are no clock or reset signals associated with this module.

**Reset Behavior**:
- Not applicable, as there are no registers or flip-flops within this module.

**Initial States**:
- Not applicable, as there are no state-holding elements.

**Implementation Notes**:
- The module should be implemented in a way that any changes on the input `in_bit` are immediately reflected on the output `out_bit`.
- Ensure that signal integrity is maintained across the wire.

**Example Verilog Implementation**:
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in_bit,
    output wire out_bit
);
    // Direct wire connection
    assign out_bit = in_bit;
endmodule
```
**Boundary Conditions**:
- As this module functions as a simple wire, there are no specific boundary conditions beyond ensuring signal integrity.
