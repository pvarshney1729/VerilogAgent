I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in (100 bits)
 - output out_and
 - output out_or
 - output out_xor

The module should implement a combinational circuit with 100 inputs,
in[99:0]. There are 3 outputs:

  (1) out_and : output of a 100-input AND gate
  (2) out_or  : output of a 100-input OR  gate
  (3) out_xor : output of a 100-input XOR gate

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name**: `TopModule`

**Interface Specifications**:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input [99:0] in;`  
    - Description: A 100-bit wide input vector. Bit 99 is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit 0 is the least significant bit (LSB).
- **Outputs**:
  - `output out_and;`  
    - Description: Single-bit output representing the logical AND of all 100 input bits.
  - `output out_or;`  
    - Description: Single-bit output representing the logical OR of all 100 input bits.
  - `output out_xor;`  
    - Description: Single-bit output representing the logical XOR of all 100 input bits.

**Behavioral Specifications**:
- The module implements a purely combinational logic circuit.
- **Logical Operations**:
  1. `out_and` is high (1) if and only if all bits of `in[99:0]` are high (1).
  2. `out_or` is high (1) if at least one bit of `in[99:0]` is high (1).
  3. `out_xor` is high (1) if there is an odd number of bits set to high (1) in `in[99:0]`.

**Timing Specifications**:
- The module is purely combinational; thus, there are no clock or reset signals required.
- Propagation delay should be minimized but is dependent on synthesis and implementation.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Ensure the minimization of gate levels to optimize for speed.
- Consider synthesizer-specific optimizations for handling wide XOR operations.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- If `in[99:0]` is all zeros, `out_and` is 0, `out_or` is 0, and `out_xor` is 0.
- If `in[99:0]` is all ones, `out_and` is 1, `out_or` is 1, and `out_xor` is 0.
