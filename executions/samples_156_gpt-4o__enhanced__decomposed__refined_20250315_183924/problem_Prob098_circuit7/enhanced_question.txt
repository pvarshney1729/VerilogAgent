I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  a
 - output q

This is a sequential circuit. Read the simulation waveforms to determine
what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  clk a   q
  0ns   0   x   x
  5ns   1   0   x
  10ns  0   0   x
  15ns  1   0   1
  20ns  0   0   1
  25ns  1   0   1
  30ns  0   0   1
  35ns  1   1   1
  40ns  0   1   1
  45ns  1   1   0
  50ns  0   1   0
  55ns  1   1   0
  60ns  0   1   0
  65ns  1   1   0
  70ns  0   1   0
  75ns  1   1   0
  80ns  0   1   0
  85ns  1   1   0
  90ns  0   1   0

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

**Module Name and Purpose:**
- Module Name: `TopModule`
- Purpose: Implements a simple sequential circuit where output `q` toggles based on input `a` and the clock signal.

**Interface Specification:**
- `input logic clk;` // 1-bit clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- `input logic a;`   // 1-bit data input.
- `output logic q;`  // 1-bit output, initially defined as `0`.

**Initial and Reset Behavior:**
- Initial State: At the start (time = 0ns), `q` should be initialized to `0`.
- Reset Behavior: The module does not include a reset signal. Initial state setting is assumed to occur at power-up or simulation start.

**Timing and Behavioral Description:**
- The module operates based on the positive edge of the clock.
- Output `q` toggles its state when `a` is high on the rising edge of `clk`.
- When `a` is low, `q` maintains its current state.

**Waveform Analysis and State Description:**
- At `t = 15ns`, `a` is `0` and `q` becomes `1`, indicating a state change when `a` is low.
- At `t = 45ns`, `a` is `1` and `q` changes from `1` to `0`, marking a toggle behavior.
- **State Transition Rule:** If `a == 1` on the rising edge of `clk`, toggle `q`. If `a == 0`, hold `q`.

**Implementation Notes:**
- The circuit is sensitive to `clk` and `a` inputs and should be synthesized to ensure minimal propagation delays.
- Ensure that `q` is correctly initialized in the simulation environment or hardware setup.

**Verilog Implementation:**
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic a,
    output logic q
);

    initial begin
        q = 0; // Initialize q to 0
    end

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (a) begin
            q <= ~q; // Toggle q if a is high
        end
    end

endmodule
```

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The input `a` and the behavior of `q` when `a` toggles between edge cases are explicitly handled by the always block, ensuring predictable operation.

**Additional Notes:**
- It is assumed that the simulation environment or hardware setup initializes `q` to `0` before the first clock cycle.
