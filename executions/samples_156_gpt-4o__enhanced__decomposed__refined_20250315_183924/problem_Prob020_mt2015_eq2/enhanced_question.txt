I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  A (2 bits)
 - input  B (2 bits)
 - output z

The module should implement a circuit that has two 2-bit inputs A[1:0]
and B[1:0], and produces an output z. The value of z should be 1 if A =
B, otherwise z should be 0.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Interfaces Ambiguity:**
   - The original specification does not define the signedness of the inputs, although it is common for comparison operations to use unsigned values.
   - The input and output ports lack explicit width definitions in the description, despite being mentioned separately.

2. **Bit-ordering and Indexing:**
   - The specification mentions `A[1:0]` and `B[1:0]`, but does not clarify whether `A[1]` and `B[1]` are the most significant bits (MSB) or least significant bits (LSB).

3. **Timing Behavior:**
   - The specification does not specify whether the comparison operation is intended to be combinational or if it involves sequential logic with clocked behavior.

4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - There's no mention of any reset behavior, which might be necessary if the module requires initialization.

5. **Initial States:**
   - No initial state is defined for the output `z`, which may be relevant if sequential logic is implied.

6. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The specification is clear in terms of functional intent (`z` is 1 if `A = B`), but an explicit statement about handling of undefined or unexpected inputs could be beneficial, even if assumed to be zero.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Name:** `TopModule`

**Signal Interface:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `input [1:0] A;`  // 2-bit unsigned input, where `A[1]` is the MSB and `A[0]` is the LSB.
  - `input [1:0] B;`  // 2-bit unsigned input, where `B[1]` is the MSB and `B[0]` is the LSB.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output reg z;`  // 1-bit output, initially set to 0.

**Behavior:**
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit. The output `z` should be high (`1`) if and only if the 2-bit input `A` is equal to the 2-bit input `B`. Otherwise, `z` should be low (`0`).

**Timing Behavior:**
- This is a combinational circuit. The output `z` will reflect changes in the inputs `A` and `B` without any delay typical of sequential elements.

**Reset Behavior:**
- There is no reset behavior required as the module is purely combinational.

**Initial State:**
- As this is a combinational circuit, initial states are not applicable beyond the initial zero state of `z`.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure the logic for comparison considers the unsigned nature of the inputs.
- Use the equality operator in Verilog (`==`) to compare the values of `A` and `B` directly.
- The design assumes all inputs are well-defined and valid within their bit range.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The module inherently handles all possible values of `A` and `B` (00, 01, 10, 11) due to the nature of binary comparison.
