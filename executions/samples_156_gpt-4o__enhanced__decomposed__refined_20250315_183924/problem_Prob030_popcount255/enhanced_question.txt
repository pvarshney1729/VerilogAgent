I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (255 bits)
 - output out (  8 bits)

A "population count" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input
vector. The module should implement a population count circuit for a
255-bit input vector.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name**: `TopModule`

**Interface Specification**:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input [254:0] in` - A 255-bit wide input vector. Bit `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB), and `in[254]` is the most significant bit (MSB). The input is treated as an unsigned vector.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output [7:0] out` - An 8-bit wide output vector representing the population count of '1's in the input vector. Bit `out[0]` is the LSB, and `out[7]` is the MSB. The output is treated as an unsigned vector.

**Functional Behavior**:
- The module computes the population count of '1's in the 255-bit input vector `in` and outputs the count as an 8-bit unsigned integer on `out`.
- If the number of '1's exceeds 255, the output will saturate at its maximum value, `8'b11111111` (255).

**Timing and Control**:
- The module is purely combinational, requiring no clock signal. It continuously computes the population count based on the current value of `in`.

**Reset and Initial State**:
- As the module is purely combinational, no reset or initial state is required for its functionality.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Ensure that the synthesis tool correctly infers a combinational logic circuit without any sequential elements.
- Consider using a parallel counting technique or an efficient combinational circuit to minimize propagation delay.
- The implementation should be optimized for speed and resource utilization given the potentially high fan-in of the input vector.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- Since the output is limited to 8 bits, explicitly handle cases where the population count exceeds 255 by saturating the output at 255.

**Naming Conventions**:
- Maintain descriptive and consistent naming conventions to enhance readability and maintainability of the design.
