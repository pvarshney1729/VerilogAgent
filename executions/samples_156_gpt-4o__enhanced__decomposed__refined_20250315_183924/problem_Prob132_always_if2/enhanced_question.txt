Consider the following adder-subtractor with a zero flag:

  module TopModule (
      input      cpu_overheated,
      output reg shut_off_computer,
      input      arrived,
      input      gas_tank_empty,
      output reg keep_driving
  );

      always @(*) begin
          if (cpu_overheated)
             shut_off_computer = 1;
      end

      always @(*) begin
          if (~arrived)
             keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
      end

  endmodule

Unfortunately, this module has a bug. Implement a new version of this
module that fixes the bug.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire  cpu_overheated,      // Input signal indicating CPU overheating
    input wire  arrived,             // Input signal indicating arrival status
    input wire  gas_tank_empty,      // Input signal indicating if the gas tank is empty
    output reg  shut_off_computer,   // Output to shut off the computer
    output reg  keep_driving         // Output to keep driving
);

    // Initial state for outputs
    initial begin
        shut_off_computer = 0;
        keep_driving = 0;
    end

    // Combinational logic for shut_off_computer
    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1; // Shut off computer if CPU is overheated
        else
            shut_off_computer = 0; // Otherwise, do not shut off
    end

    // Combinational logic for keep_driving
    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived) begin
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty; // Keep driving if not arrived and the gas tank is not empty
        end else begin
            keep_driving = 0; // Stop driving if arrived
        end
    end

endmodule
```

**Notes:**

- **Signal Initialization:** The initial block sets the initial state of the registers to ensure they start in a known state.
- **Complete Logic Specification:** Both `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` have complete logic specified to prevent latches.
- **Combinational Logic:** The module uses combinational logic, as inferred by the use of `always @(*)`.
- **Naming Convention:** Consistent use of underscores in signal names for clarity.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Behavior is specified for all combinations of `arrived` and `gas_tank_empty` inputs.
