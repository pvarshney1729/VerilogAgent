I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in            (100 bits)
 - output out_both      (100 bits)
 - output out_any       (100 bits)
 - output out_different (100 bits)

The module takes as input a 100-bit input vector in[99:0] and should
produce the following three outputs:

  (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether
  both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'.
  For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both
  1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so
  simply set out_both[99] to be zero.

  (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any
  of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'.
  For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1.
  Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so
  simply set out_any[0] to be zero.

  (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate
  whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to
  the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is
  different from in[99]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping
  around, so in[99]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Interface Clarity**: The original specification mentions that all input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified. However, it should explicitly define the bit-width and naming conventions for clarity.

2. **Bit Indexing and Ordering**: The specification needs to explicitly mention the indexing convention (MSB/LSB) used for the input and output vectors.

3. **Neighbor Definition**: The terms "neighbor to the left" and "neighbor to the right" are used without explicitly defining the relationship in terms of bit indexing.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The behavior for boundary bits (e.g., `in[99]` for `out_both` and `in[0]` for `out_any`) is specified as "the answer is obvious," which should be explicitly stated with the logic.

5. **Reset and Initial State**: The specification lacks details about reset behavior and initial states, which are crucial for sequential circuits. However, since the specification describes combinational logic, this might not be necessary, but stating so explicitly would prevent confusion.

6. **Signal Dependencies and Race Conditions**: The specification should clarify the precedence and dependencies of operations, although not critical here, as it primarily describes combinational logic.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Interface and Signal Definition:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire [99:0] in,            // 100-bit input vector
    output wire [99:0] out_both,      // 100-bit output vector
    output wire [99:0] out_any,       // 100-bit output vector
    output wire [99:0] out_different  // 100-bit output vector
);
```

- **Input/Output Details**:
  - `in[99:0]`: 100-bit wide input vector.
  - `out_both[99:0]`: 100-bit wide output vector, combinational logic.
  - `out_any[99:0]`: 100-bit wide output vector, combinational logic.
  - `out_different[99:0]`: 100-bit wide output vector, combinational logic.

- **Bit Indexing and Order**: The vectors are indexed from 0 to 99, with `in[0]` being the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[99]` being the most significant bit (MSB).

**Behavioral Specification:**

1. **out_both**:
   - For each bit `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ 98), `out_both[i]` is set to '1' if both `in[i]` and `in[i+1]` are '1', otherwise '0'.
   - Boundary condition: `out_both[99]` is always '0' as `in[99]` has no neighbor to the left.

2. **out_any**:
   - For each bit `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ 99), `out_any[i]` is set to '1' if either `in[i]` or `in[i-1]` is '1', otherwise '0'.
   - Boundary condition: `out_any[0]` is always '0' as `in[0]` has no neighbor to the right.

3. **out_different**:
   - For each bit `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ 99), `out_different[i]` is set to '1' if `in[i]` is different from its neighbor to the left (`in[(i+1) % 100]`), otherwise '0'.
   - The vector is treated as circular, so `in[99]`'s neighbor to the left is `in[0]`.

**Implementation Notes:**

- The specified logic is purely combinational; hence, no reset or initial state is required.
- Ensure that the synthesis tool properly handles the circular nature of `out_different` by using modulo operations or equivalent logic.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

This enhanced specification should ensure that the implementation aligns precisely with the intended functionality, addressing potential ambiguities and clarifying the behavior.
