I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a              (3 bits)
 - input  b              (3 bits)
 - output out_or_bitwise (3 bits)
 - output out_or_logical
 - output out_not        (6 bits)

Implement a module with two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of
the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT)
of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not
(i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                #### Module Interface

- **Module Name:** `TopModule`
- **Port Definitions:**
  - `input [2:0] a` : 3-bit input vector `a`. Bit index 0 is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `input [2:0] b` : 3-bit input vector `b`. Bit index 0 is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `output [2:0] out_or_bitwise` : 3-bit output for the bitwise OR operation. Bit index 0 is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `output out_or_logical` : 1-bit output for the logical OR operation.
  - `output [5:0] out_not` : 6-bit output where the upper 3 bits [5:3] are the inverse of `b` and the lower 3 bits [2:0] are the inverse of `a`.

#### Behavior Description

- **Bitwise OR:** `out_or_bitwise` is the result of a bitwise OR operation between vectors `a` and `b`.
  - Formula: `out_or_bitwise[i] = a[i] | b[i]` for `i = 0 to 2`.

- **Logical OR:** `out_or_logical` is set if any bit in `a` or `b` is high.
  - Formula: `out_or_logical = (a[2] | a[1] | a[0] | b[2] | b[1] | b[0])`.

- **Inverse (NOT):** `out_not` contains the bitwise NOT of `b` in bits [5:3] and the bitwise NOT of `a` in bits [2:0].
  - Formula: `out_not[5:3] = ~b` and `out_not[2:0] = ~a`.

#### Timing and Operational Notes

- **Timing Behavior:** All operations are combinational and should be computed within a single clock cycle if incorporated into a sequential logic design.
- **Reset and Initialization:** As this design is purely combinational, no reset or initial state is required. If integrated into a larger sequential system, ensure appropriate handling of the combinational logic outputs.

#### Implementation Notes

- **Bit-Ordering Convention:** All multi-bit signals should use the convention where the least significant bit is indexed as 0.
- **Design Assumptions:** Assume that inputs `a` and `b` will always be valid 3-bit vectors.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Ensure outputs handle all possible input combinations, including all bits being zero or one.
