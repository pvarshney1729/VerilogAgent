I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a shift register with four D flops. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
Reset is active-low synchronous resettable.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                #### Module Interface:
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,       // Clock signal, positive edge triggered
    input  wire resetn,    // Active-low, synchronous reset
    input  wire in,        // Input bit for the shift register
    output wire out        // Output bit from the shift register
);
```

#### Behavioral Description:
- **Shift Register Operation**: The module implements a 4-bit right shift register.
  - On each positive edge of the clock, the following occurs:
    - The input `in` is shifted into the most significant bit (MSB) of the shift register.
    - Each bit in the shift register is moved one position to the right.
    - The least significant bit (LSB) is output as `out`.

- **Reset Behavior**:
  - The reset (`resetn`) is an active-low, synchronous signal.
  - When `resetn` is asserted low, on the next positive clock edge, all bits in the shift register are set to '0'.

#### Timing and Initial States:
- **Clock Edge**: The shift register operations are synchronized to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
- **Initial State**: Upon reset or power-up, the shift register will initialize to `0000`.

#### Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the shift operation and reset behavior are implemented in a manner that avoids race conditions.
- Verify the synthesis of the design to confirm that the reset and shift operations are correctly interpreted by the synthesis tool.

#### Example Timing Diagram:
```
clk   : ──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐──┐─
resetn: 1───\___________________/─────────────
in    : ----1---0---1---0---1---0---1---0----
out   : ----0---0---0---1---0---1---0---1----
```

This timing diagram represents the behavior of the shift register when `in` is applied during each clock cycle. The output `out` reflects the least significant bit of the shift register.
