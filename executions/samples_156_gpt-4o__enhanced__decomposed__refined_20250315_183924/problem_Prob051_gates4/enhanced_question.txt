I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in (4 bits)
 - output out_and
 - output out_or
 - output out_xor

The module should implement a combinational circuit with four inputs,
in[3:0]. There are 3 outputs:

  (1) out_and : output of a 4-input AND gate
  (2) out_or  : output of a 4-input OR  gate
  (3) out_xor : output of a 4-input XOR gate

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Port Width and Naming Conventions:**
   - The input port `in` is specified as 4 bits, but its indexing and bit significance are not explicitly defined.
   - There is no mention of signedness, although it is unlikely to be signed due to logical operations.

2. **Bit-ordering and Indexing:**
   - The specification mentions `in[3:0]`, but it is unclear whether `in[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) or the least significant bit (LSB).

3. **Timing Behavior:**
   - It is stated that the module implements a combinational circuit, yet there is no explicit mention of the absence of any clock signal, which is crucial for confirming it's purely combinational.

4. **Reset and Initial States:**
   - As a combinational circuit, reset behavior is not applicable, but this should be explicitly stated to prevent any confusion.

5. **Logical Descriptions:**
   - The specification provides a high-level description of the logic to be implemented but lacks a formal mathematical or truth table representation.

6. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - No explicit consideration is given to potential input edge cases, though these are generally implicit in the operations of AND, OR, and XOR.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Name:** `TopModule`

**Port Interface:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `input [3:0] in;` 
    - A 4-bit wide input vector with bit `in[3]` as the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB). The vector is unsigned.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output out_and;`
    - A single-bit output representing the logical AND of all bits of the input vector `in`.
  - `output out_or;`
    - A single-bit output representing the logical OR of all bits of the input vector `in`.
  - `output out_xor;`
    - A single-bit output representing the logical XOR of all bits of the input vector `in`.

**Behavioral Specification:**
- The module implements a purely combinational logic circuit. There are no sequential elements such as flip-flops or latches, and no clock signal is involved.

- **Logic Descriptions:**
  - `out_and = in[3] & in[2] & in[1] & in[0];`
  - `out_or = in[3] | in[2] | in[1] | in[0];`
  - `out_xor = in[3] ^ in[2] ^ in[1] ^ in[0];`

**Timing Specification:**
- The module is free of any clock dependencies, and all outputs change simultaneously with changes in the input vector `in`, subject to combinational logic propagation delay.

**Reset and Initial State:**
- As a combinational circuit, there is no reset signal or initial state requirement for the outputs. The outputs are driven directly by the current input values.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The outputs are defined for all combinations of the 4-bit input vector `in[3:0]`. Standard logic levels are assumed (0 and 1).

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure that the synthesis tool recognizes this as combinational logic without inferring any unintended storage elements.
- The design should be verified using a testbench that applies all possible input combinations to confirm correct output behavior.
