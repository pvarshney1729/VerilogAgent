I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input clk
 - input d
 - input q

The module should implement a single D flip-flop. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Input/Output Port Width and Naming Convention:**
   - The specification states that all input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified, but does not define if these are signed or unsigned.
  
2. **Signal Naming:**
   - The input 'q' is typically used as an output in D flip-flop circuits. This might lead to confusion regarding its role.

3. **Clock Signal:**
   - It is mentioned that the flip-flop should be triggered on the positive edge of the clock. This needs to be explicitly described in terms of how it affects signal transitions.

4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - There is no mention of a reset signal or its behavior. This is critical for initializing the state of the flip-flop.

5. **Initial State:**
   - The initial state of the flip-flop is not specified, which can lead to indeterminate behavior on power-up.

6. **Combinational vs. Sequential Logic:**
   - It is not explicitly stated that the module is purely sequential, though implied. Clarity is needed to avoid misunderstanding.

7. **Dependencies and Race Conditions:**
   - No explicit description is provided on how inputs relate to outputs sequentially, and the potential for race conditions is not addressed.

8. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The behavior of the module under edge conditions, such as simultaneous changes in input signals, is not specified.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Interface:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,   // Clock signal, positive edge-triggered
    input wire d,     // Data input for the D flip-flop
    output reg q      // Output of the D flip-flop
);
```

**Signal Definitions:**
- `clk`: Unsigned 1-bit input; serves as the clock signal with positive edge triggering.
- `d`: Unsigned 1-bit input; serves as the data input for the D flip-flop.
- `q`: Unsigned 1-bit output; serves as the data output of the D flip-flop.

**Behavior:**
- The module implements a single D flip-flop.
- The flip-flop captures the value of `d` at the rising edge of the `clk` and outputs it on `q`.

**Timing Behavior:**
- The flip-flop is sensitive to the rising edge of the `clk` signal (`posedge clk`).

**Reset Behavior:**
- This specification assumes no reset signal is required. If initialization is necessary, a reset mechanism should be added explicitly.

**Initial State:**
- The initial state of `q` should be defined. For simulation purposes, assume `q` is initialized to 0.

**Implementation Notes:**
- The module is purely sequential and does not incorporate any combinational logic other than the flip-flop operation.
- Ensure there are no race conditions by correctly synchronizing `d` with `clk`.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The module assumes normal operating conditions where `clk` is stable and transitions cleanly.
- Simultaneous changes in `d` and `clk` are resolved at the rising edge of `clk`.

**Example Verilog Implementation:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,  // Clock signal
    input wire d,    // Data input
    output reg q     // Output
);

    initial begin
        q = 0; // Initialize q to 0
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d; // Capture the value of d on the rising edge of clk
    end

endmodule
```
