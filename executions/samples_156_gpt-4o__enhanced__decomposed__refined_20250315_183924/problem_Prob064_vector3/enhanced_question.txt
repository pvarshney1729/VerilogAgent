I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a (5 bits)
 - input  b (5 bits)
 - input  c (5 bits)
 - input  d (5 bits)
 - input  e (5 bits)
 - input  f (5 bits)
 - output w (8 bits)
 - output x (8 bits)
 - output y (8 bits)
 - output z (8 bits)

The module should concatenate the input vectors together then split them
up into several output vectors. There are six 5-bit input vectors: a, b,
c, d, e, and f, for a total of 30 bits of input. There are four 8-bit
output vectors: w, x, y, and z, for 32 bits of output. The output should
be a concatenation of the input vectors followed by two 1 bits (the two 1
bits should be in the LSB positions).

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Enhanced Specification for `TopModule`

#### Interface

- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Input Ports**:
  - `input [4:0] a` - 5-bit input vector
  - `input [4:0] b` - 5-bit input vector
  - `input [4:0] c` - 5-bit input vector
  - `input [4:0] d` - 5-bit input vector
  - `input [4:0] e` - 5-bit input vector
  - `input [4:0] f` - 5-bit input vector
- **Output Ports**:
  - `output [7:0] w` - 8-bit output vector
  - `output [7:0] x` - 8-bit output vector
  - `output [7:0] y` - 8-bit output vector
  - `output [7:0] z` - 8-bit output vector

#### Behavior

- **Concatenation Order**: The inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` are concatenated in the order listed, resulting in a 30-bit vector. The two additional '1' bits are appended as the least significant bits to form a 32-bit vector.
  
- **Output Assignment**:
  - `w` is assigned the most significant 8 bits of the 32-bit vector.
  - `x` is assigned the next 8 bits following `w`.
  - `y` is assigned the next 8 bits following `x`.
  - `z` is assigned the least significant 8 bits, which include the two '1' bits added last.

#### Timing

- **Logic Type**: The operation is purely combinational. There are no sequential elements, latches, or flip-flops involved.

#### Implementation Notes

- **Bit Indexing**: All vectors follow the convention where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `bit[4]` or `bit[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB), depending on the vector size.
  
- **Reset and Initial States**: No reset behavior or initial states are required for this purely combinational logic module.

- **Boundary Conditions**: As the input vectors are purely deterministic and finite, no special boundary condition handling is needed.

The implementation should ensure the above behavior is achieved using standard Verilog practices.
