I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output out

The module should implement the Karnaugh map below. d is don't-care,
which means you may choose to output whatever value is convenient.

              ab
   cd   01  00  10  11
   00 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   01 | 0 | 0 | d | d |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name**: `TopModule`

#### Interface:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire a` : 1-bit input.
  - `input wire b` : 1-bit input.
  - `input wire c` : 1-bit input.
  - `input wire d` : 1-bit input.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire out` : 1-bit output.

#### Bit Ordering:
- The Karnaugh map uses the following bit ordering for indexing: 
  - `ab` represents the column index with `a` as the most significant bit (MSB) and `b` as the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `cd` represents the row index with `c` as the MSB and `d` as the LSB.

#### Timing Behavior:
- This design is a **combinational logic circuit**. There are no clocked elements; thus, it does not rely on any specific timing behavior beyond propagation delay inherent to logic gates.

#### Reset and Initialization:
- As a combinational circuit, there is no reset behavior or initial state required for this module.

#### Behavior and Implementation:
- The logic function is derived from the Karnaugh map as follows:
  - Out = (c'b + cd) + (c'd'b) 
  - Where `d` is treated as a don't-care condition, allowing it to be optimized out in logic minimization processes.
  
- Karnaugh Map Interpretation:
  ```
                ab
     cd   01  00  10  11
     00 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |
     01 | 0 | 0 | d | d |
     11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
     10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  ```
  - The above map indicates the desired output for each combination of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

#### Implementation Notes:
- The use of `d` as a don't-care condition allows flexibility in implementation, potentially minimizing gate count.
- Ensure that any synthesis tool used for implementation understands the don't-care conditions for optimal logic synthesis.

#### Boundary Conditions:
- All 16 possible input combinations are covered as per the Karnaugh map, ensuring complete coverage within the defined behavior.

### Verilog Code Template:
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire out
);
    // Implement the logic derived from the Karnaugh map
    assign out = (~c & b) | (c & d) | (~c & ~d & b);
endmodule
```
