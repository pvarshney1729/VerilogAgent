I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  train_valid
 - input  train_taken
 - output state (2 bits)

The module should implement a two-bit saturating counter. The counter
increments (up to a maximum of 3) when train_valid = 1 and
train_taken = 1. It decrements (down to a minimum of 0) when
train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0. When not training (train_valid = 0),
the counter keeps its value unchanged. areset is a positive edge
triggered asynchronous reset that resets the counter to weakly not-taken
(2'b01). Output state[1:0] is the two-bit counter value. Assume all
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Port Widths and Signedness**: The specification mentions that all ports are one bit unless otherwise specified, but it does not explicitly state the width of the `state` output. Although implied to be 2 bits, explicit confirmation is needed.

2. **Bit Ordering**: There is no mention of how the bits in `state` are ordered, i.e., which bit is the MSB and which is the LSB.

3. **Reset Behavior**: It states that `areset` is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset, but it does not clarify if it is active-high or active-low.

4. **Initial State**: While it specifies an initial weakly not-taken state upon reset, it should be clear about the value of the counter at power-up or after synthesis.

5. **Sequential Logic Timing**: The specification implies sequential behavior but should explicitly state that the counter operates on the positive edge of `clk`.

6. **Boundary Conditions**: It should clarify what happens if both `train_valid` and `train_taken` are 0 simultaneously, though it seems the counter should remain unchanged.

7. **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming conventions should be used for clarity, which may involve distinguishing between inputs and outputs more clearly.

**Module Interface:**
- Module Name: `TopModule`
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk`: The clock signal; all sequential operations occur on its positive edge.
  - `input wire areset`: Active-high asynchronous reset signal; resets the counter.
  - `input wire train_valid`: Signal indicating whether training should occur.
  - `input wire train_taken`: Signal indicating the outcome of the training event.
- Outputs:
  - `output reg [1:0] state`: Two-bit counter representing the state, where `state[1]` is the MSB and `state[0]` is the LSB.

**Behavioral Specification:**
- **Counter Operation:**
  - **Increment**: If `train_valid=1` and `train_taken=1`, increment the counter value by 1, up to a maximum of `2'b11`.
  - **Decrement**: If `train_valid=1` and `train_taken=0`, decrement the counter value by 1, down to a minimum of `2'b00`.
  - **Hold**: If `train_valid=0`, maintain the current counter value irrespective of `train_taken`.
  
- **Reset Behavior:**
  - The `areset` signal is active-high and asynchronously resets the counter to `2'b01` when it transitions from low to high.
  - On reset, the counter initializes to the weakly not-taken state, which is `state = 2'b01`.

**Timing and Edge Conditions:**
- **Clock Domain**: All sequential logic updates occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
- **Edge Cases**: If both `train_valid` and `train_taken` are `0`, the counter remains in its current state.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure that the counter saturates at the boundaries (i.e., does not wrap around from `3` to `0` or vice versa).
- The design is intended for synthesis and simulation; ensure that tool-specific constraints are met for asynchronous reset and timing closure.
