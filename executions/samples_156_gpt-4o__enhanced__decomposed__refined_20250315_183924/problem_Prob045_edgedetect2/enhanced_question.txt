I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input clk
 - input in       (8 bits)
 - output anyedge (8 bits)

Implement a module that for each bit in an 8-bit input vector, detect
when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next (detect
any edge). The output bit of anyedge should be set to 1 the cycle 
after the input bit has 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition occurs. Assume all 
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Interface Specification:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.
  - `input [7:0] in`: 8-bit input vector, unsigned. `in[0]` is the least significant bit.
- **Outputs:**
  - `output reg [7:0] anyedge`: 8-bit output vector, unsigned. `anyedge[0]` corresponds to `in[0]`.

**Behavior Specification:**
- The module detects transitions (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) on each bit of the input vector `in` from one clock cycle to the next.
- For each bit in the input vector `in`, the corresponding bit in the output vector `anyedge` will be set to `1` during the clock cycle immediately following the detection of a transition on the input bit.

**Timing and Reset Behavior:**
- **Clocking:**
  - All sequential logic is synchronous, triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
- **Reset:**
  - A synchronous active-high reset signal, `input rst`, is assumed to be added for completeness.
  - During reset (`rst = 1`), the output `anyedge` should be set to `8'b0`.

**Initial State:**
- On power-up, it is assumed that the internal state used to store the previous value of `in` is initialized to `8'b0`.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use internal registers to hold the previous state of the input vector `in` for comparison on each clock cycle.
- Ensure that the comparison and update of the `anyedge` output are performed in a single clock cycle, immediately following the detection of any edge on the input bits.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The behavior is defined for all possible transitions within the 8-bit input vector.
- If multiple bits in the input vector transition simultaneously, the corresponding bits in the output vector will all be set to `1` on the following clock cycle.

**Example Verilog Module:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst, // Added reset input for clarity
    input wire [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] anyedge
);

reg [7:0] prev_in; // Internal register to store the previous state of `in`

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
        anyedge <= 8'b0;
        prev_in <= 8'b0;
    end else begin
        anyedge <= (in ^ prev_in); // XOR operation to detect any edge
        prev_in <= in;
    end
end

endmodule
```
