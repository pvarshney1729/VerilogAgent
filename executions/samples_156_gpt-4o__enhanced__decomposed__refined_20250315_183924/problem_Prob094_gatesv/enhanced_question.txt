I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in            (4 bits)
 - output out_both      (4 bits)
 - output out_any       (4 bits)
 - output out_different (4 bits)

You are given a four-bit input vector. We want to know some relationships
between each bit and its neighbour:

  (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether
  both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher
  index) are '1'. For example, out_both[2] should indicate if in[2] and
  in[3] are both 1. Since in[3] has no neighbour to the left, the answer
  is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[3].

  (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any
  of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'.
  For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1.
  Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we
  don't need to know out_any[0].

  (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate
  whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to
  the left. For example, out_different[2] should indicate if in[2] is
  different from in[3]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping
  around, so in[3]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                #### Module Interface:

- **Module Name:** `TopModule`
- **Input Ports:**
  - `input [3:0] in`  // 4-bit input vector, where `in[3]` is the MSB and `in[0]` is the LSB.

- **Output Ports:**
  - `output [2:0] out_both`  // 3-bit output, indicating bitwise "both are 1" condition for in[2:0] and their left neighbors.
  - `output [2:0] out_any`   // 3-bit output, indicating bitwise "any is 1" condition for in[1:3] and their right neighbors.
  - `output [3:0] out_different`  // 4-bit output, indicating bitwise difference with left neighbor, with wrap-around consideration.

#### Behavior:

1. **`out_both`:**
   - `out_both[i] = in[i] & in[i+1]` for `i = 0, 1, 2`.
   - This output checks if both `in[i]` and its neighbor to the left (`in[i+1]`) are '1'. Since `in[3]` has no neighbor to the left, `out_both[3]` is not defined and the port is only 3 bits wide.

2. **`out_any`:**
   - `out_any[i] = in[i] | in[i-1]` for `i = 1, 2, 3`.
   - This output checks if any of `in[i]` or its neighbor to the right (`in[i-1]`) is '1'. Since `in[0]` has no neighbor to the right, `out_any[0]` is not defined and the port is only 3 bits wide.

3. **`out_different`:**
   - `out_different[i] = in[i] ^ in[(i+1) % 4]` for `i = 0, 1, 2, 3`.
   - This output checks if `in[i]` is different from its neighbor to the left, with wrap-around behavior such that `in[3]` is compared with `in[0]`.

#### Timing and Logic Type:

- **Combinational Logic:** This module implements purely combinational logic. All outputs are derived directly from the current input values without any clocked elements.

- **No Reset Required:** As the module is combinational, no reset logic is necessary.

#### Implementation Notes:

- **Boundary Conditions:** The design explicitly ignores `out_both[3]` and `out_any[0]` as per the described behavior, and these should not be implemented.
- **Output Defaults:** In the absence of specific conditions, default the unused bits to zero if necessary for synthesis tools, but ensure they are not part of the functional design intent.
