I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output out_assign
 - output out_alwaysblock

The module should implement an AND gate using both an assign statement
and a combinational always block.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Specification: TopModule

#### Interface
- **Inputs**
  - `input wire a`: 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire b`: 1-bit input signal.

- **Outputs**
  - `output wire out_assign`: 1-bit output signal resulting from the AND operation using an assign statement.
  - `output reg out_alwaysblock`: 1-bit output signal resulting from the AND operation using a combinational always block.

#### Behavior
- **Functional Description**
  - The module `TopModule` implements a basic AND gate.
  - The output `out_assign` is generated directly using an `assign` statement.
  - The output `out_alwaysblock` is computed within a combinational `always` block.

- **Logical Implementation**
  - **assign Statement**: The output `out_assign` is continuously assigned the result of `a AND b`.
  - **always Block**: The output `out_alwaysblock` is updated in a combinational `always` block that is sensitive to changes in inputs `a` and `b`.

#### Timing and Reset Behavior
- **Timing**: This module implements purely combinational logic with no clock signal involved. This means that changes in the inputs `a` and `b` will immediately reflect on the outputs.
- **Reset**: No reset behavior is applicable as there are no sequential elements in this design.

#### Initial States
- No initial state is required or defined since the module is purely combinational.

#### Implementation Notes
- Ensure that inputs `a` and `b` are valid one-bit signals to prevent unintended behavior.
- The outputs are updated immediately upon any change in the inputs due to the combinational nature of the logic.

### Verilog Module Template
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_alwaysblock
);

// Implement AND gate using assign statement
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Implement AND gate using combinational always block
always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```
