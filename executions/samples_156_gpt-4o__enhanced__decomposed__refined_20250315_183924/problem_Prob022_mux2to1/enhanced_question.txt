I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  sel
 - output out

The module should implement a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer. When
sel=0, choose a. When sel=1, choose b.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                Module Name: `TopModule`

Interface:
- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire a` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire b` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire sel` : 1-bit selection input signal.
  
- **Outputs:**
  - `output wire out` : 1-bit output signal.

Behavior:
- This module implements a combinational logic 2-to-1 multiplexer.
- The output `out` is determined by the value of `sel`:
  - If `sel` is 0, `out` is assigned the value of `a`.
  - If `sel` is 1, `out` is assigned the value of `b`.

Timing:
- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clock signals or sequential logic. Changes in inputs instantly reflect in the output.

Additional Notes:
- It is assumed that `sel` will always be driven with a valid logic level (0 or 1). The module does not handle undefined or invalid logic levels for `sel`.
- The module does not include or require any reset logic as there are no sequential elements.

Implementation Example:
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire sel,
    output wire out
);
    assign out = (sel == 1'b0) ? a : b;
endmodule
```
