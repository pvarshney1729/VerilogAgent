I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output q

The module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation
waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  a  b  c  d  q
  0ns   0  0  0  0  0
  5ns   0  0  0  0  0
  10ns  0  0  0  0  0
  15ns  0  0  0  0  0
  20ns  0  0  0  1  0
  25ns  0  0  1  0  0

  35ns  0  1  0  0  0
  40ns  0  1  0  1  1
  45ns  0  1  1  0  1
  50ns  0  1  1  1  1
  55ns  1  0  0  0  0
  60ns  1  0  0  1  1
  65ns  1  0  1  0  1
  70ns  1  0  1  1  1
  75ns  1  1  0  0  0
  80ns  1  1  0  1  1
  85ns  1  1  1  0  1
  90ns  1  1  1  1  1

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### TopModule Specification

**Interface Definition:**
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Input Ports**:
  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input, representing the most significant input variable.
  - `input wire b`: Single-bit input.
  - `input wire c`: Single-bit input.
  - `input wire d`: Single-bit input, representing the least significant input variable.
- **Output Ports**:
  - `output wire q`: Single-bit output.

**Behavioral Description:**
- **Combinational Logic Function**: The circuit implements a combinational logic function based on the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The output `q` is determined by the following conditions derived from the simulation waveform:

  - `q = 1` if any of the following conditions are true:
    - `(b AND d) = 1`
    - `(c AND (a OR b)) = 1`
  - Otherwise, `q = 0`.

**Truth Table:**
- The logic for `q` based on inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` is captured in the following truth table:

  | a | b | c | d | q |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Timing Considerations**: As this is a combinational circuit, the output `q` should reflect changes to the input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` immediately without any timing delay or dependence on clock cycles.
- **Bit-ordering**: Inputs are treated in descending significance from `a` to `d`, with `a` being the most significant bit and `d` being the least significant bit.
- **No Reset or Initial State Required**: As it is a purely combinational circuit, there are no registers or flip-flops that require reset behavior or initial state definitions.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The behavior of the circuit is fully defined for all possible combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- No undefined or unexpected behavior is expected outside of the specified input conditions.
