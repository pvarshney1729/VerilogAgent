I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  sel   (3 bits)
 - input  data0 (4 bits)
 - input  data1 (4 bits)
 - input  data2 (4 bits)
 - input  data3 (4 bits)
 - input  data4 (4 bits)
 - input  data5 (4 bits)
 - output out   (4 bits)
);

The module should implement a 6-to-1 multiplexer. When sel is between 0
and 5, choose the corresponding data input. Otherwise, output 0. The data
inputs and outputs are all 4 bits wide.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Enhanced Specification for TopModule

#### Module Interface
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Port Definitions**:
  - `input [2:0] sel`: 3-bit input used for selecting one of the 6 inputs.
  - `input [3:0] data0`: 4-bit data input.
  - `input [3:0] data1`: 4-bit data input.
  - `input [3:0] data2`: 4-bit data input.
  - `input [3:0] data3`: 4-bit data input.
  - `input [3:0] data4`: 4-bit data input.
  - `input [3:0] data5`: 4-bit data input.
  - `output reg [3:0] out`: 4-bit output.

#### Behavior
- **Multiplexer Logic**: 
  - The module implements a 6-to-1 multiplexer. 
  - When `sel` is in the range 0 to 5, the corresponding `data` input is routed to the `out` port. 
  - If `sel` is 0, `out` equals `data0`.
  - If `sel` is 1, `out` equals `data1`.
  - If `sel` is 2, `out` equals `data2`.
  - If `sel` is 3, `out` equals `data3`.
  - If `sel` is 4, `out` equals `data4`.
  - If `sel` is 5, `out` equals `data5`.
  - For `sel` values 6 or 7, `out` is set to `4'b0000`.

#### Timing and Signal Evaluation
- **Combinational Logic**: 
  - This module does not contain any internal state and is purely combinational.
  - Changes in `sel` or any `data` input result in immediate updates to `out` without any clock cycle delay.

#### Bit-ordering
- **MSB/LSB Convention**: 
  - The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0], and the most significant bit (MSB) is indexed as bit[3].

#### Implementation Notes
- **Reset and Initial States**: 
  - As this is a combinational logic circuit, no reset behavior is required. The initial state of `out` is not applicable as the output is directly dependent on the inputs.

#### Boundary Conditions
- **Handling Undefined Sel Values**: 
  - For any `sel` value not explicitly defined (6 or 7), `out` will default to `4'b0000`, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing unintended logic states.
