I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output out

The module should implement the Karnaugh map below.

             ab
  cd   00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Name and Purpose
The module, named `TopModule`, implements a combinational logic function based on the provided Karnaugh map. The function takes four single-bit inputs and produces a single-bit output.

### Signal Interface
- **Inputs**
  - `input wire a`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `input wire b`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `input wire c`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `input wire d`: 1-bit input, unsigned.

- **Output**
  - `output wire out`: 1-bit output, unsigned.

### Bit-ordering
- All signals are single-bit, and bit-ordering is not applicable. By convention, bit[0] is the least significant bit if multi-bit signals were used.

### Timing Behavior
- The module implements **combinational logic**. No clock or reset signals are used.

### Karnaugh Map and Boolean Expression
- The Karnaugh map provided is fully specified, covering all input conditions:

  ```
             ab
  cd   00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  ```

- **Boolean Expression**: The Boolean expression derived from the Karnaugh map is:
  ```
  out = (~c & ~d & b) | (~c & d & ~b) | (c & ~d & b) | (c & d & ~b)
  ```

### Implementation Notes
- The module should be implemented using combinational logic gates according to the derived Boolean expression.
- Ensure all possible input combinations are accounted for, as outlined in the Karnaugh map.
- No timing, reset, or initial state considerations are necessary due to the combinational nature.
  
### Verilog Implementation
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire out
);
    assign out = (~c & ~d & b) | (~c & d & ~b) | (c & ~d & b) | (c & d & ~b);
endmodule
```
