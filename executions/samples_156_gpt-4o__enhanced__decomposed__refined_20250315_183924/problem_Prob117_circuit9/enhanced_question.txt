I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  a
 - output q (3 bits)

The module implements a sequential circuit. Read the simulation waveforms
to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  clk a   q
  0ns   0   1   x
  5ns   1   1   4
  10ns  0   1   4
  15ns  1   1   4
  20ns  0   1   4
  25ns  1   1   4
  30ns  0   1   4
  35ns  1   1   4
  40ns  0   1   4
  45ns  1   0   4
  50ns  0   0   4
  55ns  1   0   5
  60ns  0   0   5
  65ns  1   0   6
  70ns  0   0   6
  75ns  1   0   0
  80ns  0   0   0
  85ns  1   0   1
  90ns  0   0   1

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Input/Output Port Widths and Signedness:**
   - The input `clk` and `a` are one bit, but the width of output `q` is specified as 3 bits. The signedness (whether they are signed or unsigned) is not specified.

2. **Bit-Ordering and Indexing:**
   - There is no explicit mention of the bit-ordering convention (MSB/LSB) for the 3-bit output `q`.

3. **Timing Behavior:**
   - The specification states that the module is a sequential circuit but lacks clear timing behavior definitions, such as the clock edge (rising or falling) used for triggering any state transitions or updates to `q`.

4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - There is no mention of any reset mechanism (synchronous or asynchronous) or the initial state of the output `q`.

5. **Initial States:**
   - The initial state of `q` is unspecified in the simulation waveform (denoted by `x`), which suggests an unknown or undefined state.

6. **Dependencies and Operation Precedence:**
   - The functional relationship between inputs and the output `q` is unclear. There is no description of how `a` affects the sequential logic or the conditions under which `q` changes.

7. **Simulation Waveform Description:**
   - The simulation waveform is provided without context on what specific behavior or operations it represents, leaving the intended functionality ambiguous.

8. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - There is no specification of behavior for edge cases, such as what happens if `a` changes mid-cycle or if `clk` is not a perfect square wave.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Interface:**
```verilog
module TopModule(
    input wire clk,       // Clock signal
    input wire a,         // Single-bit input
    output reg [2:0] q    // 3-bit output, unsigned
);
```

**Bit-Ordering:**
- The 3-bit output `q` is indexed from bit 2 to bit 0, where bit 2 is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit 0 is the least significant bit (LSB).

**Timing Behavior:**
- The module operates on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`.
- Changes to the output `q` are triggered by this rising edge.

**Reset Behavior:**
- An asynchronous reset input is recommended to ensure a defined initial state. However, if no reset is used, the initial state must be explicitly set in the always block.

**Initial States:**
- Upon instantiation or reset, the output `q` should be initialized to `3'b000`.

**Functional Description:**
- The module implements a state machine or counter-like behavior based on the input `a`:
  - When `a` is high (`1`), `q` remains at `4` (`3'b100`).
  - When `a` goes low (`0`), `q` increments with each clock cycle until it reaches `6` (`3'b110`), then wraps around to `0`.

**Simulation Waveform Description:**
- The waveform shows that `q` holds the value `4` as long as `a` remains high.
- When `a` becomes low, `q` increments from `4` to `5`, `6`, and then resets to `0`.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure that `q` is updated only on the rising edge of `clk`.
- Add logic to handle the wrap-around behavior of `q` when it transitions from `6` to `0`.

**Verilog Implementation:**
```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 3'b000; // Initial state upon reset
    end else begin
        if (a == 1'b1) begin
            q <= 3'b100; // Hold at '4' when a is high
        end else begin
            if (q == 3'b110) begin
                q <= 3'b000; // Wrap around from '6' to '0'
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1; // Increment q
            end
        end
    end
end
```

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Ensure that `clk` is a clean square wave for proper operation.
- Handle any potential glitches or hazards in `a` with appropriate debouncing or filtering if necessary.
