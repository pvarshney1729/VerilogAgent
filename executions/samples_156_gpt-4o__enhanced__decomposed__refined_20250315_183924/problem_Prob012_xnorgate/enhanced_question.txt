I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output out

The module should implement an XNOR gate.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Specification for `TopModule`

#### Interface Definition
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Input Ports**:
  - `input wire a` : 1-bit wide, unsigned
  - `input wire b` : 1-bit wide, unsigned
- **Output Ports**:
  - `output wire out` : 1-bit wide, unsigned

#### Behavioral Description
- **Functional Intent**: The module should implement a combinational logic XNOR gate.
- **Logical Operation**: The output `out` should be the result of the XNOR operation on inputs `a` and `b`.
  - **Truth Table**:
    - `a = 0, b = 0 → out = 1`
    - `a = 0, b = 1 → out = 0`
    - `a = 1, b = 0 → out = 0`
    - `a = 1, b = 1 → out = 1`
  - **Mathematical Expression**: `out = ~(a ^ b)`

#### Timing and State Considerations
- **Logic Type**: This module is purely combinational with no internal state or memory elements.
- **Reset Behavior**: Not applicable as there are no sequential elements.
- **Initial State**: Not applicable.

#### Implementation Notes
- **Combinational Logic**: Ensure that the module does not infer any latches or flip-flops.
- **Synthesis and Optimization**: The logic synthesis should recognize this as a simple XNOR gate without unnecessary gates or delays.

#### Edge Case and Boundary Conditions
- **Input Domains**: Inputs `a` and `b` are expected to be binary (0 or 1). The module does not handle multi-bit inputs or signed operations.
