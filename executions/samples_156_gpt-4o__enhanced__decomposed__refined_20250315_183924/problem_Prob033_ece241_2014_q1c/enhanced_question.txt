I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a (8 bits)
 - input  b (8 bits)
 - output s (8 bits)
 - output overflow

Assume that you have two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0].
The module should add these numbers to produce s[7:0]. Also compute
whether a (signed) overflow has occurred.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues

1. **Signal Interfaces**: 
   - The width and signedness of input and output signals are mostly clear, but the specification does not explicitly state whether these signals are signed or unsigned. This is crucial for 2's complement arithmetic.
   
2. **Bit-ordering**:
   - There is an implicit assumption about the bit ordering, likely that bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB), but this should be explicitly stated.

3. **Overflow Calculation**:
   - The specification mentions computing an overflow but does not detail how this should be calculated for 2's complement numbers.

4. **Initial States**:
   - There is no mention of the initial state of the output signals, particularly `s` and `overflow`.

5. **Timing and Reset Behavior**:
   - The specification does not clarify whether the operation is combinational or sequential, nor does it mention reset behavior.

6. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The behavior of the module at extreme values of `a` and `b`, such as the maximum and minimum 8-bit 2's complement values, should be explicitly defined.

### <ENHANCED_SPEC>

#### Module Interface
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Inputs**:
  - `input signed [7:0] a`: An 8-bit signed integer input, where `a[7]` is the MSB.
  - `input signed [7:0] b`: An 8-bit signed integer input, where `b[7]` is the MSB.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output signed [7:0] s`: An 8-bit signed integer output, representing the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - `output overflow`: A 1-bit output indicating whether a signed overflow occurred during the addition.

#### Behavior
- **Combinational Logic**: This module operates as combinational logic, performing the addition of `a` and `b` and setting `s` and `overflow` based on the result.
- **Overflow Detection**: 
  - An overflow occurs when the sign of `a` and `b` are the same, but the sign of `s` differs from `a` and `b`.
  - Specifically, overflow is detected using the following logic: 
    - `overflow = ((a[7] == b[7]) && (s[7] != a[7]))`.

#### Bit-ordering and Indexing
- **Bit Indexing**: 
  - `a[0]` and `b[0]` are the least significant bits (LSBs).
  - `a[7]` and `b[7]` are the most significant bits (MSBs).

#### Initial States
- **Initial Output States**: 
  - Upon instantiation, the output `s` should be initialized to 8'b00000000.
  - The `overflow` signal should be initialized to 1'b0.

#### Timing and Reset Behavior
- **Reset**: 
  - Not applicable since the operation is combinational and does not involve sequential elements or clocked operations.

#### Boundary Conditions
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Ensure correct operation at the extremes of 2's complement values, such as adding `a = 8'b01111111` and `b = 8'b00000001` should result in `s = 8'b10000000` and `overflow = 1`.

#### Implementation Notes
- The module should be implemented using only combinational logic elements. No clock or reset signals are required as the behavior is purely combinational.
