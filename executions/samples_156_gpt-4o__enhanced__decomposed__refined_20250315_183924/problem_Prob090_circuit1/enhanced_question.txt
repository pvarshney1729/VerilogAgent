I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output q

The module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation
waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  a  b  q
  0ns   0  0  0
  5ns   0  0  0
  10ns  0  0  0
  15ns  0  0  0
  20ns  0  0  0
  25ns  0  1  0
  30ns  0  1  0
  35ns  1  0  0
  40ns  1  0  0
  45ns  1  1  1
  50ns  1  1  1
  55ns  0  0  0
  60ns  0  0  0
  65ns  0  1  0
  70ns  0  1  0
  75ns  1  0  0
  80ns  1  0  0
  85ns  1  1  1
  90ns  1  1  1

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

**Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Interface:**
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,  // One-bit input
    input wire b,  // One-bit input
    output wire q  // One-bit output
);
```

**Signal Characteristics:**
- All inputs (`a`, `b`) and output (`q`) are single-bit wide.
- All signals are treated as unsigned.

**Behavior:**
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The truth table for the circuit is as follows:

  | a | b | q |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Logical Description:**
- The output `q` is the logical AND of inputs `a` and `b`.
- This can be expressed as: `q = a & b`

**Implementation Notes:**
- Since this is a combinational circuit, no clock or reset signals are required.
- The circuit should be free of latches or flip-flops, ensuring purely combinational logic.
- The output `q` is updated immediately based on the current values of inputs `a` and `b`.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The truth table provided covers all possible input combinations for the inputs `a` and `b`.
- The implementation should be robust against any single-bit input changes.

**Timing:**
- As a purely combinational circuit, there is no timing dependency or clock cycle relationship. The response of the output `q` to changes in inputs `a` and `b` should be instantaneous.

**Example Verilog Implementation:**
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire q
);
    assign q = a & b;  // Logical AND operation
endmodule
```
