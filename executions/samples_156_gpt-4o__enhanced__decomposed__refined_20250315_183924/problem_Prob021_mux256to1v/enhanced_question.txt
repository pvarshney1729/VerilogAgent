I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (1024 bits)
 - input  sel (   8 bits)
 - output out (   4 bits)

The module should implement a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. The 256
4-bit inputs are all packed into a single 1024-bit input vector. sel=0
should select bits in[3:0], sel=1 selects bits in[7:4], sel=2 selects
bits in[11:8], etc.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Interfaces:**
   - The input `in` is specified as 1024 bits, but there is no explicit mention of its bit-ordering or indexing conventions (e.g., MSB/LSB).
   - There is no clarity on the signedness of the input and output ports.

2. **Bit-Ordering:**
   - The specification lacks explicit detail on whether the least significant bit (LSB) starts from the rightmost or leftmost position in the 1024-bit input vector.

3. **Timing Behavior:**
   - The specification does not clarify whether the multiplexer operates combinationally or sequentially, nor does it specify any clock signal if sequential behavior is intended.

4. **Reset Behavior and Initial States:**
   - There is no mention of reset behavior or initial states, which might be relevant if sequential elements are assumed.

5. **Dependencies and Precedence:**
   - The precedence of operations is implicit in the multiplexer logic, but the transition from the `sel` input to the selection of output bits could be clarified.

6. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - There is no explicit mention of what happens if `sel` exceeds the maximum value of 255, which might be an input boundary condition to consider.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Interface:**

- Module Name: `TopModule`
- Port Definitions:
  - `input [1023:0] in`   // 1024-bit input vector, indexed from 0 (LSB) to 1023 (MSB).
  - `input [7:0] sel`     // 8-bit selector input, unsigned.
  - `output [3:0] out`    // 4-bit output vector, unsigned.

**Bit-Ordering and Indexing:**

- The input vector `in` is indexed such that `in[0]` is the least significant bit and `in[1023]` is the most significant bit.
- The `sel` input uses standard binary numbering to index the 256 groups of 4 bits from the `in` vector.

**Behavioral Specification:**

- The module implements a combinational logic multiplexer.
- The `sel` input determines which group of 4 bits from the `in` vector is routed to the `out` output.
- Specifically, for a given value of `sel`, the `out` will be assigned as follows:
  - `out = in[(sel*4)+3 : sel*4]` where `sel` ranges from 0 to 255.

**Boundary Conditions:**

- If `sel` is within the range of 0 to 255, the corresponding 4 bits are output as defined.
- Input values of `sel` beyond 255 should result in undefined behavior, as they fall outside the intended selection range.

**Implementation Notes:**

- The multiplexer operates without the need for a clock signal, as it is purely combinational logic.
- No reset functionality is required for this module as there are no internal state-holding elements.
- Ensure the Verilog implementation handles the `sel` input correctly, avoiding any potential out-of-bounds access.
