I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is
asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has
to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to
monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three
successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock
cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y
has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should
maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not
become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0
permanently (until reset). Assume all sequential logic is triggered on
the positive edge of the clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **TopModule Interface:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,       // Clock input, positive edge triggered.
    input wire resetn,    // Synchronous active-low reset.
    input wire x,         // Input from motor.
    input wire y,         // Input from motor.
    output reg f,         // Control output for motor.
    output reg g          // Control output for motor.
);
```

**Behavioral Description:**

1. **Reset Behavior:**
   - The FSM starts in state A when the module is reset (resetn is low).
   - On the first positive clock edge after resetn becomes high, the FSM transitions out of state A.

2. **State Transitions:**
   - **State A (Reset State):** 
     - Outputs: `f = 0`, `g = 0`.
     - Transition: On resetn de-asserted (high), move to State B on the next positive clock edge.

   - **State B (Initial Active State):**
     - Outputs: `f = 1` for one clock cycle, then `f = 0`.
     - Transition: Wait for the pattern `x = 1, 0, 1` across successive clock cycles to move to State C.

   - **State C (Pattern Detected):**
     - Outputs: `g = 1`.
     - Transition: Monitor `y` for two clock cycles.
       - If `y = 1` within two cycles, transition to State D.
       - If `y != 1` after two cycles, transition to State E.

   - **State D (Hold State):**
     - Outputs: `g = 1` permanently until reset.
     - Transition: Remain in this state unless reset.

   - **State E (Error State):**
     - Outputs: `g = 0` permanently until reset.
     - Transition: Remain in this state unless reset.

3. **Sequential Logic:**
   - The FSM transitions occur on the positive edge of `clk`.

4. **Output Behavior:**
   - `f` is asserted for one clock cycle immediately after reset de-assertion and then remains `0`.
   - `g` is set based on the sequence of inputs `x` and `y` as described.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `x` does not achieve the sequence `1, 0, 1`, the FSM stays in State B until the sequence is detected.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Ensure all state transitions and outputs are updated on the positive clock edge.
- The reset (resetn) should be checked synchronously, and all registers should be initialized accordingly.
- The FSM states can be encoded as binary or one-hot, based on synthesis preferences.
