I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output q

The module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation
waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  a  b  c  d  q
  0ns   0  0  0  0  0
  5ns   0  0  0  0  0
  10ns  0  0  0  0  0
  15ns  0  0  0  0  0
  20ns  0  0  0  1  0
  25ns  0  0  1  0  1
  30ns  0  0  1  1  1
  35ns  0  1  0  0  1
  40ns  0  1  0  1  1
  45ns  0  1  1  0  1
  50ns  0  1  1  1  1
  55ns  1  0  0  0  0
  60ns  1  0  0  1  0
  65ns  1  0  1  0  1
  70ns  1  0  1  1  1
  75ns  1  1  0  0  1
  80ns  1  1  0  1  1
  85ns  1  1  1  0  1
  90ns  1  1  1  1  1

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Interface
The module `TopModule` should be defined as follows:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire a;` // 1-bit input, unsigned
  - `input wire b;` // 1-bit input, unsigned
  - `input wire c;` // 1-bit input, unsigned
  - `input wire d;` // 1-bit input, unsigned
- **Output**:
  - `output wire q;` // 1-bit output, unsigned

### Module Behavior
- The circuit implements a combinational logic function. The output `q` is determined by the logical equation derived from the truth table:
  - `q = (b & !a) | (c & !d & !a) | (d & c);`

### Timing Behavior
- The module is purely combinational, meaning that the output `q` changes immediately in response to changes in the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, without any clock dependency.

### Initial Conditions
- For a combinational circuit, initial conditions are not applicable as there is no internal state to initialize. The output `q` will directly depend on the input conditions from the start.

### Implementation Notes
- Ensure that the logic synthesis tools are set to optimize the logic as a purely combinational circuit, without introducing unnecessary latches or flip-flops.
- Verify the behavior against edge cases and input combinations directly from the logical expression provided.

### Example Code
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire q
);

    assign q = (b & !a) | (c & !d & !a) | (d & c);

endmodule
```
