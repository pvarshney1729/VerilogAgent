I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a ( 3 bits)
 - output q (16 bits)

The module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation
waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  a     q
  0ns   x     x
  5ns   x     x
  10ns  x     x
  15ns  0  1232
  20ns  1  aee0
  25ns  2  27d4
  30ns  3  5a0e
  35ns  4  2066
  40ns  5  64ce
  45ns  6  c526
  50ns  7  2f19
  55ns  0  1232
  60ns  1  aee0
  65ns  2  27d4
  70ns  4  2066
  75ns  1  aee0
  80ns  1  aee0
  85ns  3  5a0e
  90ns  5  64ce

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ```
Module Specification: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [2:0] a`: A 3-bit wide input vector, where `a[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `a[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB). This input is considered unsigned.

- Output Ports:
  - `output [15:0] q`: A 16-bit wide output vector, where `q[15]` is the MSB and `q[0]` is the LSB. This output is considered unsigned.

Behavior:
- The module implements a combinational circuit that maps the 3-bit input `a` to a 16-bit output `q` based on predefined fixed values. The mapping is as follows:
  - If `a == 3'b000`, then `q = 16'h1232`
  - If `a == 3'b001`, then `q = 16'haee0`
  - If `a == 3'b010`, then `q = 16'h27d4`
  - If `a == 3'b011`, then `q = 16'h5a0e`
  - If `a == 3'b100`, then `q = 16'h2066`
  - If `a == 3'b101`, then `q = 16'h64ce`
  - If `a == 3'b110`, then `q = 16'hc526`
  - If `a == 3'b111`, then `q = 16'h2f19`

- Any input value of `a` outside the range 3'b000 to 3'b111 is not valid, and the behavior is undefined.

Timing Behavior:
- The circuit is purely combinational, with no state retention or memory elements. Changes in `a` will immediately reflect changes in `q` according to the mapping.

Reset Behavior:
- There is no reset behavior specified as the circuit is purely combinational.

Initial States:
- Since the circuit is combinational, there are no initial states for flip-flops or registers.

Implementation Notes:
- The implementation should ensure minimal propagation delay by optimizing the combinational logic, possibly using a lookup table or case statement for efficient mapping.
- Ensure that the logic synthesis adheres to the specified input-to-output mapping without introducing unintended latches or stateful elements.

Boundary Conditions:
- The circuit should only be evaluated for valid inputs within the specified range. Inputs outside this range result in undefined behavior and should be handled appropriately during testing.
