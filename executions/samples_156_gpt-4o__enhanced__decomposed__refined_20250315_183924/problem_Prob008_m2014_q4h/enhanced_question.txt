I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in
 - output out

The module should assign the output port to the same value as the input
port combinationally.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Name:
- `TopModule`

### Interface:
- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire in`  // 1-bit input signal, unsigned
- **Outputs:**
  - `output wire out` // 1-bit output signal, unsigned

### Signal Conventions:
- **Naming:** All signal names are lowercase and use underscores to separate words.
- **Bit-ordering:** Since inputs and outputs are single bits, there is no indexing required.

### Behavior:
- **Logic Description:**
  - The module performs a direct combinational assignment from the input `in` to the output `out`.
  - This means that any change in the `in` signal is immediately reflected on the `out` signal without any delay.

### Timing:
- **Combinational Logic:**
  - The output `out` reflects the state of the input `in` in a combinational manner, which means no clock or state elements are involved.

### Reset Behavior and Initial States:
- **Reset:** Not applicable, as the module does not contain any sequential logic elements.
- **Initial State:** Not applicable, as the module is purely combinational.

### Boundary Conditions:
- **Input Low (0):** When `in` is `0`, `out` is `0`.
- **Input High (1):** When `in` is `1`, `out` is `1`.

### Implementation Notes:
- This module is designed to mimic a wire connection from `in` to `out`. It is essentially a buffer that provides no logical transformation.

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input wire in,  // 1-bit input signal
  output wire out // 1-bit output signal
);

  assign out = in; // Combinational assignment from input to output

endmodule
```
