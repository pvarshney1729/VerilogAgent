I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output out

The module should implement a 2-input AND gate.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Specification: TopModule

#### Interface
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Input Ports**:
  - `input wire a;`  // 1-bit input, unsigned
  - `input wire b;`  // 1-bit input, unsigned
- **Output Ports**:
  - `output wire out;`  // 1-bit output, unsigned

#### Behavior
- **Logic Functionality**: 
  - The module implements a 2-input AND gate.
  - Logical Equation: `out = a & b;`

#### Timing
- **Type of Logic**: Combinational
  - The outputs are immediately responsive to the changes in the inputs without any clock dependency.

#### Implementation Notes
- **Signal Naming Convention**: All signals are named in lowercase to maintain consistency and readability.
- **Truth Table**:
  - | a | b | out |
    |---|---|-----|
    | 0 | 0 |  0  |
    | 0 | 1 |  0  |
    | 1 | 0 |  0  |
    | 1 | 1 |  1  |

#### Miscellaneous
- While this specification is straightforward due to its simplicity, adherence to these details will aid in scaling the design to more complex modules.
