I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in
 - input  state (10 bits)
 - output next_state (10 bits)
 - output out1
 - output out2

Given the follow state machine with 1 input and 2 outputs (the outputs
are given as "(out1, out2)"):

  S0 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S0 (0, 0) --1--> S1
  S1 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S1 (0, 0) --1--> S2
  S2 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S2 (0, 0) --1--> S3
  S3 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S3 (0, 0) --1--> S4
  S4 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S4 (0, 0) --1--> S5
  S5 (0, 0) --0--> S8
  S5 (0, 0) --1--> S6
  S6 (0, 0) --0--> S9
  S6 (0, 0) --1--> S7
  S7 (0, 1) --0--> S0
  S7 (0, 1) --1--> S7
  S8 (1, 0) --0--> S0
  S8 (1, 0) --1--> S1
  S9 (1, 1) --0--> S0
  S9 (1, 1) --1--> S1

Suppose this state machine uses one-hot encoding, where state[0] through
state[9] correspond to the states S0 though S9, respectively. The outputs
are zero unless otherwise specified. The next_state[0] through next_state[9] 
correspond to the transition to next states S0 though S9. For example, The 
next_state[1] is set to 1 when the next state is S1 , otherwise, it is set to 0.

Here, the input state[9:0] can be a combinational of multiple states, and 
the TopModule is expected to response.
For example: 
When the state[9:0] = 10'b0000010100, state[4] == 1, and state[2] == 1, the 
states includes S4, and S2 states.

The module should implement the state transition logic and output logic
portions of the state machine (but not the state flip-flops). You are
given the current state in state[9:0] and must implement next_state[9:0] 
and the two outputs.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### MODULE: TopModule

#### Interface

- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire in`: A 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [9:0] state`: A 10-bit one-hot encoded state vector where bit[0] corresponds to S0 and bit[9] to S9.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output wire [9:0] next_state`: A 10-bit vector indicating the next state, one-hot encoded.
  - `output wire out1`: A 1-bit output signal.
  - `output wire out2`: A 1-bit output signal.

#### Behavior

1. **State Transitions:**
   - The state machine transitions are based on the `in` input and the current `state`.
   - State transitions for each state Si (i = 0 to 9):
     - Defined explicitly with two possible transitions: `in = 0` and `in = 1`.
   - For `in = 0` or `in = 1`, determine `next_state` based on the provided transition table.

2. **Output Logic:**
   - `out1` and `out2` are set based on the current state outputs, as specified:
     - S7: `out1 = 0`, `out2 = 1`
     - S8: `out1 = 1`, `out2 = 0`
     - S9: `out1 = 1`, `out2 = 1`
   - All other states: `out1 = 0`, `out2 = 0`.

3. **Combinational Nature:**
   - The logic for `next_state` and outputs is purely combinational, with no internal state storage.

#### Timing Behavior

- This module is designed as combinational logic without a clock signal. Transitions happen instantaneously based on input changes.

#### Reset and Initial Conditions

- The module does not implement state flip-flops or reset logic, as it only computes `next_state` and outputs based on the current `state`.

#### Assumptions and Constraints

- It is assumed that `state` is valid and only one-hot encoded.
- If multiple bits in `state` are set (invalid one-hot encoding), the behavior is undefined.
- The module is expected to handle valid one-hot encoded states only.

#### Notes

- Bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) used to represent S0, and Bit[9] is for S9.
- The state transitions and output logic must be implemented as per the state transition table provided.
