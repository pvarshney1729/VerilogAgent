I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  slowena
 - output q (4 bits)

The module should implement a decade counter that counts from 0 through
9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is active high
synchronous, and should reset the counter to 0. We want to be able to
pause the counter rather than always incrementing every clock cycle, so
the "slowena" input if high indicates when the counter should increment.
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Enhanced Specification for TopModule

#### Module Interface:
- **Module Name**: `TopModule`
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input wire reset`: Active high, synchronous reset signal.
  - `input wire slowena`: Control signal to enable counting.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output reg [3:0] q`: 4-bit counter output. `q[3]` is the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the Least Significant Bit (LSB).

#### Functional Description:
- The `TopModule` implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9.
- The counter increments by 1 on each rising edge of `clk` if `slowena` is high.
- The counter should wrap around from 9 back to 0.
- When `reset` is high, the counter `q` will reset to 0 on the next rising edge of the clock.

#### Timing Behavior:
- **Clock**: All sequential logic is triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.
- **Reset**: 
  - The reset is synchronous and active high.
  - When `reset` is high, the counter output `q` is set to 0 on the next rising edge of `clk`, regardless of the state of `slowena`.

#### Initial State:
- The counter output `q` initializes to 0 at power-up and after a reset.

#### Boundary Conditions:
- When the counter value reaches 9 (`q == 4'b1001`) and `slowena` is high, the next value will be 0 (`q == 4'b0000`).

#### Signal Dependencies and Precedence:
- If `reset` is high, it takes precedence over `slowena`. The counter will reset to 0 on the next clock cycle, irrespective of the `slowena` signal.

#### Implementation Notes:
- Use a synchronous reset to ensure the counter resets predictably with the clock.
- Ensure the Verilog description accurately reflects these specifications, with clear comments to maintain readability and correctness during implementation.
