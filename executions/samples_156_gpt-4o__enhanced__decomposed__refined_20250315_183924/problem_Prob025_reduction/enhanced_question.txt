I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in     (8 bits)
 - output parity

Parity checking is often used as a simple method of detecting errors when
transmitting data through an imperfect channel. The module should compute
a parity bit for an 8-bit byte (which will add a 9th bit to the byte). We
will use "even" parity, where the parity bit is just the XOR of all 8
data bits.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Interface

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire [7:0] in,      // 8-bit input data, in[7] is MSB, in[0] is LSB
    output wire parity        // 1-bit output for even parity
);
```

### Signal Interfaces
- **Input:**
  - `in`: An 8-bit wide input vector. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is `in[7]`, and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) is `in[0]`.
  
- **Output:**
  - `parity`: A single-bit output representing the even parity of the input vector `in`.

### Timing Behavior
- The module is purely combinational and computes the parity bit based on the current input `in`. No clock or sequential logic is involved.

### Reset Behavior
- Since the module is combinational, no reset logic is required.

### Initial States
- Not applicable as the module does not contain any sequential elements.

### Logical Description
- The parity bit is computed as the XOR of all bits in the input `in`. The mathematical representation is:
  \[
  \text{parity} = in[7] \oplus in[6] \oplus in[5] \oplus in[4] \oplus in[3] \oplus in[2] \oplus in[1] \oplus in[0]
  \]
- This ensures even parity, where the total number of 1s in `in` plus `parity` is even.

### Boundary Conditions
- The module assumes valid 8-bit inputs are always provided since it is purely combinational and does not handle erroneous input states. No specific handling for other conditions is required.

### Implementation Notes
- Since the functionality is combinational, the `parity` output updates immediately with any change in the `in` input without delay.
- This module does not include any clock inputs or edge-triggered logic as it purely defines a combinational operation.

```verilog
assign parity = ^in; // Verilog reduction XOR operator for even parity
endmodule
```
