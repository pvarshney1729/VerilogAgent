I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a   (16 bits)
 - input  b   (16 bits)
 - input  c   (16 bits)
 - input  d   (16 bits)
 - input  e   (16 bits)
 - input  f   (16 bits)
 - input  g   (16 bits)
 - input  h   (16 bits)
 - input  i   (16 bits)
 - input  sel ( 4 bits)
 - output out (16 bits)

The module should implement a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. sel=0
chooses a, sel=1 chooses b, etc. For the unused cases (sel=9 to 15), set
all output bits to '1'.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Name
- **TopModule**: The main module implementing the specified functionality.

### Interface

- **Inputs**:
  - `input [15:0] a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i;`
    - Description: 16-bit wide unsigned inputs.
    - Bit-Ordering: `a[15]` is the most significant bit (MSB), and `a[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `input [3:0] sel;`
    - Description: 4-bit wide unsigned selection input for the multiplexer.
    - Bit-Ordering: `sel[3]` is the MSB, and `sel[0]` is the LSB.

- **Output**:
  - `output reg [15:0] out;`
    - Description: 16-bit wide unsigned output of the multiplexer.
    - Bit-Ordering: `out[15]` is the MSB, and `out[0]` is the LSB.

### Behavior

- **Multiplexer Logic**:
  - The module implements a 9-to-1 multiplexer:
    - `sel = 0`: `out = a`
    - `sel = 1`: `out = b`
    - `sel = 2`: `out = c`
    - `sel = 3`: `out = d`
    - `sel = 4`: `out = e`
    - `sel = 5`: `out = f`
    - `sel = 6`: `out = g`
    - `sel = 7`: `out = h`
    - `sel = 8`: `out = i`
    - `sel = 9 to 15`: All bits of `out` are set to `1` (i.e., `out = 16'hFFFF`).

### Timing Behavior

- **Combinational Logic**:
  - This module operates as a purely combinational logic circuit. The output `out` reflects the input selection immediately upon any change in `sel` or any input signal.

### Reset and Initial State

- **Reset Behavior**: Not applicable as the module is combinational.

### Implementation Notes

- Ensure that all paths are covered for `sel` values from 0 to 15 to avoid potential latch inference.
- This design assumes that all inputs (`a` to `i`) and the `sel` signal are stable and valid throughout the combinational logic operation.
- The module does not handle glitch or meta-stability on `sel`. Ensure that `sel` is stable and debounced in the larger system context.

### Boundary Conditions

- The module assumes `sel` is within the valid range of 0 to 15. Behavior for out-of-range `sel` values is not defined and should be managed by upstream logic.
