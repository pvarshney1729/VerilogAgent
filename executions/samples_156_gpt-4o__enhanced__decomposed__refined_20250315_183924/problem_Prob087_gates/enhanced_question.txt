I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output out_and
 - output out_or
 - output out_xor
 - output out_nand
 - output out_nor
 - output out_xnor
 - output out_anotb

The module should implement a combinational circuit with two inputs, a
and b. There are 7 outputs, each with a logic gate driving it:

  (1) out_and: a and b
  (2) out_or: a or b
  (3) out_xor: a xor b
  (4) out_nand: a nand b
  (5) out_nor: a nor b
  (6) out_xnor: a xnor b
  (7) out_anotb: a and-not b

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ### Module Name
- `TopModule`

### Interface
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire a`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `input wire b`: 1-bit input, unsigned.

- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire out_and`: 1-bit output, result of `a AND b`.
  - `output wire out_or`: 1-bit output, result of `a OR b`.
  - `output wire out_xor`: 1-bit output, result of `a XOR b`.
  - `output wire out_nand`: 1-bit output, result of `a NAND b`.
  - `output wire out_nor`: 1-bit output, result of `a NOR b`.
  - `output wire out_xnor`: 1-bit output, result of `a XNOR b`.
  - `output wire out_anotb`: 1-bit output, result of `a AND (NOT b)`.

### Behavior
- The module is purely combinational, producing outputs based solely on the current input values without any dependence on clock cycles.

### Timing and Reset
- **Combinational Circuit**: The module does not include any sequential logic and thus has no clock or reset signals.
- **Reset Behavior**: Not applicable.

### Implementation Notes
- **Logical Operations**:
  1. `out_and = a & b`: Logical AND.
  2. `out_or = a | b`: Logical OR.
  3. `out_xor = a ^ b`: Logical XOR.
  4. `out_nand = ~(a & b)`: Logical NAND.
  5. `out_nor = ~(a | b)`: Logical NOR.
  6. `out_xnor = ~(a ^ b)`: Logical XNOR.
  7. `out_anotb = a & ~b`: Logical AND-NOT.

### Naming Conventions
- All signal names are in lowercase and use underscores to separate words for readability.

### Additional Notes
- **Bit-Ordering**: Not applicable as all operations are single-bit, but future designs should specify MSB/LSB conventions.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Inputs `a` and `b` are single-bit, thus inherently bounded to 0 or 1.
