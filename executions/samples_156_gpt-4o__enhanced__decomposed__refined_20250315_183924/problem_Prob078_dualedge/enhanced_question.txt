I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  d
 - output q

A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.
However, FPGAs don't have dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and using an
always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) is not accepted as a legal
sensitivity list. Build a circuit that functionally behaves like a
dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name**: `TopModule`

**Interface Specification**:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, assumed active high.
  - `input wire d`: Data input, one bit, unsigned.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output reg q`: Data output, one bit, unsigned.

**Behavior and Timing**:
- The module emulates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard FPGA resources.
- The flip-flop captures the input `d` on both the rising and falling edge of the `clk` signal.
- This is achieved by using intermediate storage elements to capture the value `d` on the rising edge and updating the output `q` on the falling edge, or vice versa.
  
**Reset Behavior**:
- The module does not include an explicit reset signal in this specification. Implementations should consider adding a reset signal if necessary for specific applications or environments.

**Initial State**:
- The initial value of `q` is explicitly defined as `0` at power-up.

**Implementation Notes**:
- A common method to achieve dual-edge triggering in FPGAs is to use two separate always blocks: one triggered on the rising edge of the clock to capture `d` into an internal register, and another on the falling edge to update the output `q`.
- This approach ensures compatibility with FPGA architectures that do not natively support dual-edge triggering.

**Example Implementation**:
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire d,
    output reg q
);

    reg d_rising_edge;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        d_rising_edge <= d;
    end

    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q <= d_rising_edge;
    end

endmodule
```

**Boundary Conditions**:
- The behavior on any clock glitches or metastability conditions is dependent on the physical implementation and should be considered during synthesis and placement/routing optimizations. Ensure proper clock tree synthesis and signal integrity to avoid issues.
