I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (256 bits)
 - input  sel (  8 bits)
 - output out

The module should implement a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. The 256
inputs are all packed into a single 256-bit input vector. sel=0 should
select in[0], sel=1 selects bits in[1], sel=2 selects bits in[2], etc.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

**Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Interface:**
```verilog
module TopModule(
    input  wire [255:0] in,   // 256-bit wide input vector
    input  wire [7:0]   sel,  // 8-bit wide selection input
    output wire         out   // 1-bit wide output
);
```

**Signal Definitions:**
- **`in`**: A 256-bit wide unsigned input vector. Bit `[0]` represents the least significant bit (LSB).
- **`sel`**: An 8-bit wide unsigned input used to select one of the 256 bits from `in`.
- **`out`**: A 1-bit wide unsigned output representing the selected bit.

**Behavior:**
- The module functions as a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.
- The value of `sel` determines which bit from the `in` vector is routed to the `out` port.
  - When `sel` = 0, `out` = `in[0]`.
  - When `sel` = 1, `out` = `in[1]`.
  - ...
  - When `sel` = 255, `out` = `in[255]`.

**Timing Behavior:**
- This module is purely combinational. There are no clock inputs as it directly maps the selected input to the output without any sequential logic.

**Reset Behavior:**
- There is no reset logic implemented or required as this module is combinational.

**Initial States:**
- Since this is a combinational logic module, no initial state is required. The output is determined solely by the current values of `in` and `sel`.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- If `sel` is outside the range of 0 to 255, the behavior is undefined. It is assumed `sel` will always be within the valid range due to the nature of the 8-bit wide input.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure that synthesizers infer a combinational multiplexer for efficient hardware implementation.
- No race conditions exist as the logic is purely combinational.
