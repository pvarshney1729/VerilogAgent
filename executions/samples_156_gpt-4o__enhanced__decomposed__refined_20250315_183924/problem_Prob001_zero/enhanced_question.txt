I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - output zero

The module should always outputs a LOW.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **

**Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Interface:**
```verilog
module TopModule (
    output logic zero  // Single-bit output port, named 'zero'.
);
```

**Port Definitions:**
- **Output Ports:**
  - `zero`: A 1-bit output port that continuously outputs a logic LOW ('0').

**Behavior:**
- The `zero` output is a constant LOW signal regardless of any conditions or inputs. This implies a purely combinational logic implementation.

**Timing and Logic Type:**
- **Logic Type:** Combinational logic. The module does not rely on any clock signal or sequential logic elements.
- **Timing:** There are no timing dependencies as the output is constant.

**Reset and Initial States:**
- **Reset Behavior:** Not applicable, as the module does not use any sequential elements or registers.
- **Initial State:** The output `zero` is initialized to and remains in the LOW ('0') state continuously.

**Implementation Notes:**
- The module is designed to provide a constant logic LOW output. No additional logic or inputs are required, ensuring minimal resource usage.
