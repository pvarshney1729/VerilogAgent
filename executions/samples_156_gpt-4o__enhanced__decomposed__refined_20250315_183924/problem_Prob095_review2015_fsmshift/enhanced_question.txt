I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output shift_ena

This module is a part of the FSM for controlling a shift register, we
want the ability to enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles
whenever the proper bit pattern is detected. Whenever the FSM is reset,
assert shift_ena for 4 cycles, then 0 forever (until reset). Reset should
be active high synchronous.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Interface Clarity**: The interface lacks explicit bit-width definitions for the ports, though it implies they are single-bit. It does not mention the signedness, which can be assumed to be unsigned for control signals but should be explicitly stated.

2. **Reset Behavior**: The reset behavior is described but could be more explicit regarding its initial state and its effect on all outputs. The term "assert" is used ambiguouslyâ€”it's not clear if it means setting `shift_ena` to 1 or some other action.

3. **Bit Pattern Detection**: There is an implicit assumption of a "proper bit pattern," but this pattern is not defined. This needs to be specified for implementation.

4. **Timing Behavior**: The specification mentions synchronous reset and positive edge-triggered sequential logic but does not explicitly describe any clock cycle relationships or timing constraints.

5. **FSM Description**: The functional description of the FSM is not detailed. There is no description of states other than the reset-related behavior.

6. **Sequential Logic Details**: The specification lacks details on what should happen between resets if the specified bit pattern is not detected.

7. **Boundary Conditions**: The behavior of the FSM when the reset is deactivated is not clearly described, particularly after the initial 4-cycle assertion of `shift_ena`.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Name**: `TopModule`

**Interface Specification**:
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- **Outputs**:
  - `output reg shift_ena`: Enable signal for the shift register.

**Port Characteristics**:
- All ports are 1-bit wide and unsigned.

**Behavioral Specification**:

1. **Reset Behavior**:
   - When `reset` is asserted (high), the FSM enters a reset state.
   - In the reset state, `shift_ena` is asserted (set to 1) for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles after the de-assertion of `reset`.
   - After 4 cycles, `shift_ena` should be de-asserted (set to 0) and remain 0 until the next `reset`.

2. **Operational States**:
   - **Idle State**: The FSM waits for the detection of a specified bit pattern (pattern not defined in the original specification; to be defined by the designer).
   - **Active State**: Upon detection of the specified bit pattern, `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles.

3. **Bit Pattern Detection**:
   - The specific bit pattern required to transition from Idle to Active state must be defined by the user/designer.

4. **Timing Behavior**:
   - The FSM operates on the positive edge of `clk`.
   - State transitions occur on the positive edge of `clk` and are synchronous with `reset`.

5. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Upon power-up, the FSM starts in the Idle state with `shift_ena` set to 0.

**Implementation Notes**:
- The designer must define the bit pattern for the transition from Idle to Active state.
- Ensure that all state transitions and outputs are synchronized with the clock edge as described.
- Consider edge cases where reset might be triggered during the Active state to ensure correct behavior.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- During normal operation without reset, `shift_ena` remains 0 unless the specified bit pattern is detected.
- Ensure that the FSM can handle back-to-back resets and pattern detections without unintended behaviors.
