I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - output one

The module should always drive 1 (or logic high).

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Port Interface:**
- `output logic high_output`: A single-bit output port that is always driven to a logic high. The name `high_output` is chosen for clarity to indicate its constant logic level.

**Module Behavior:**
- The module is purely combinational. It continuously drives the `high_output` to logic high (`1'b1`).

**Timing Behavior:**
- This module does not involve any timing or clock signals as it is purely combinational.

**Reset Behavior:**
- Not applicable, as the module does not incorporate any sequential elements or state that necessitates a reset condition.

**Initial State:**
- Not applicable, as there are no sequential elements in the design.

**Implementation Notes:**
- In Verilog, the output `high_output` will be assigned a constant value of `1'b1` using an `assign` statement.

**Verilog Implementation:**
```verilog
module TopModule (
    output logic high_output
);
    // Continuous assignment of a constant logic high to the output
    assign high_output = 1'b1;

endmodule
```
