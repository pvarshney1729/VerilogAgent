Consider the following adder-subtractor with a zero flag:

  synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
  module TopModule (
      input do_sub,
      input [7:0] a,
      input [7:0] b,
      output reg [7:0] out,
      output reg result_is_zero
  );

      always @(*) begin
          case (do_sub)
            0: out = a+b;
            1: out = a-b;
          endcase

          if (~out)
              result_is_zero = 1;
      end

  endmodule

Unfortunately, this module has a bug. Implement a new version of this
module that fixes the bug.

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                ```verilog
// Enhanced specification for a combinational adder-subtractor with a zero flag
module TopModule (
    input wire do_sub,                   // 1-bit control signal: 0 for addition, 1 for subtraction
    input wire [7:0] a,                  // 8-bit unsigned operand a
    input wire [7:0] b,                  // 8-bit unsigned operand b
    output reg [7:0] out,                // 8-bit unsigned result of the operation
    output reg result_is_zero            // 1-bit flag indicating if the result is zero
);

    // Combinational logic for adder-subtractor with zero detection
    always @(*) begin
        // Perform addition or subtraction based on the control signal
        case (do_sub)
            1'b0: out = a + b;           // Addition when do_sub is 0
            1'b1: out = a - b;           // Subtraction when do_sub is 1
            default: out = 8'b0;         // Default case for safety (though should not occur)
        endcase

        // Set the zero flag based on the output
        result_is_zero = (out == 8'b0) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; // 1 if out is zero, otherwise 0
    end

endmodule
```

### Implementation Notes:

- **Signal Interfaces:** The input `do_sub` is clarified as a single-bit signal. All inputs and outputs are defined as unsigned 8-bit wide signals to align with typical usage in arithmetic operations.
- **Bit-Ordering:** The specification assumes LSB is bit 0, which is standard in Verilog.
- **Timing Behavior:** The use of `always @(*)` is appropriate for describing combinational logic, ensuring the module operates without clock dependencies.
- **Reset Behavior and Initial States:** Although not typically relevant for combinational logic, initialization of output signals is implied during synthesis or simulation setup.
- **Logical Descriptions:** The zero detection logic explicitly sets `result_is_zero` based on the comparison `out == 8'b0`.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Overflow and underflow are not explicitly handled, as the arithmetic operations are unsigned and wrap around by default in Verilog. Additional logic might be needed if overflow detection is required.
