I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a (4 bits)
 - input  b (4 bits)
 - input  c (4 bits)
 - input  d (4 bits)
 - input  e (4 bits)
 - output q (4 bits)

The module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation
waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  a  b  c  d  e  q
  0ns   x  x  x  x  x  x
  5ns   x  x  x  x  x  x
  10ns  x  x  x  x  x  x
  15ns  a  b  0  d  e  b
  20ns  a  b  1  d  e  e
  25ns  a  b  2  d  e  a
  30ns  a  b  3  d  e  d
  35ns  a  b  4  d  e  f
  40ns  a  b  5  d  e  f
  45ns  a  b  6  d  e  f
  50ns  a  b  7  d  e  f
  55ns  a  b  8  d  e  f
  60ns  a  b  9  d  e  f
  65ns  a  b  a  d  e  f
  70ns  a  b  b  d  e  f
  75ns  a  b  c  d  e  f
  80ns  a  b  d  d  e  f
  85ns  a  b  e  d  e  f
  90ns  a  b  f  d  e  f

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Interfaces:**
   - Input and output ports are specified as 4 bits, but it is not clear if they are signed or unsigned. It is assumed they are unsigned for typical hardware design.
   - The naming convention for inputs and outputs is not fully clear, but it seems consistent with lowercase letters for inputs and `q` for output.

2. **Timing Behavior:**
   - The specification mentions a "combinational circuit," but does not provide a clear functional description. Instead, it refers to waveform data which must be interpreted to understand the circuit's behavior.
   - The specification lacks details on how transitions between different states in the waveform affect the output.

3. **Reset Behavior:**
   - There is no mention of any reset condition or initial state requirement for the combinational circuit, which is typical since combinational circuits do not have states or memory.

4. **Initial States:**
   - As a combinational circuit, there are no registers or flip-flops, so initial states are not relevant.

5. **Dependencies and Logical Descriptions:**
   - The specification relies solely on a waveform for defining behavior, which can be ambiguous. It should be translated into a logical condition or truth table.

6. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The specification does not explicitly handle undefined or unexpected input values (e.g., values of `c` beyond 9). It is assumed they are outside the intended operation range.

7. **Waveform Interpretation:**
   - The relationship between the input `c` and the output `q` appears to be conditional based on the value of `c`, but this needs to be explicitly stated.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module Name:**
- `TopModule`

**Signal Interfaces:**
- Inputs: 
  ```verilog
  input [3:0] a,  // 4-bit unsigned input
  input [3:0] b,  // 4-bit unsigned input
  input [3:0] c,  // 4-bit unsigned input
  input [3:0] d,  // 4-bit unsigned input
  input [3:0] e   // 4-bit unsigned input
  ```
- Outputs:
  ```verilog
  output reg [3:0] q  // 4-bit unsigned output
  ```

**Behavior:**
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- Behavior is defined by the input `c`:
  - If `c == 0`: `q = b`
  - If `c == 1`: `q = e`
  - If `c == 2`: `q = a`
  - If `c == 3`: `q = d`
  - If `c >= 4`: `q = 4'b1111` (assuming `f` represents 4'b1111 based on waveform pattern)

**Timing Behavior:**
- As a combinational circuit, the output `q` changes immediately in response to changes in inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `e`.

**Logical Descriptions:**
- The logic can be implemented using a case statement in Verilog:
  ```verilog
  always @* begin
      case (c)
          4'd0: q = b;
          4'd1: q = e;
          4'd2: q = a;
          4'd3: q = d;
          default: q = 4'b1111; // Covers c >= 4
      endcase
  end
  ```

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Inputs `a`, `b`, `d`, and `e` can be any 4-bit unsigned value.
- Input `c` is expected to be within the range 0 to 9. Values of `c` beyond this range will default `q` to 4'b1111, as per the observed waveform pattern.

**Implementation Notes:**
- The module should be free of race conditions as it is purely combinational.
- The output `q` must be updated based on the current values of the inputs, ensuring the correct response to any input changes.
