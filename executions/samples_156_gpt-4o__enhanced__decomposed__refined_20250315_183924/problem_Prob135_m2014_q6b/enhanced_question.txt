I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  y (3 bits)
 - input  w
 - output Y1

The module should implement the state machine shown below:

  A (0) --0--> B
  A (0) --1--> A
  B (0) --0--> C
  B (0) --1--> D
  C (0) --0--> E
  C (0) --1--> D
  D (0) --0--> F
  D (0) --1--> A
  E (1) --0--> E
  E (1) --1--> D
  F (1) --0--> C
  F (1) --1--> D

The FSM should be implemented using three flip-flops and state codes
y = 000, 001, ..., 101 for states A, B, ..., F, respectively. Implement
just the next-state logic for y[1]. The output Y1 is y[1].

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Signal Interfaces:**
   - The specification does not explicitly state the signedness of the input and output ports. 
   - The width of the input `w` and the output `Y1` is assumed to be 1 bit, but this should be explicitly stated.

2. **Bit Ordering:**
   - The specification does not define the bit-ordering convention for the multi-bit input `y`. It should clarify whether `y[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) or most significant bit (MSB).

3. **Timing Behavior:**
   - It is unclear whether the state transitions are synchronous with a clock signal, and if so, the clock signal is not specified.
   
4. **Reset Behavior:**
   - The specification does not mention how the FSM should be reset or initialized to a starting state.

5. **Initial States:**
   - The initial state of the FSM is not defined. It's crucial to specify which state the FSM should start in upon reset.

6. **Dependencies:**
   - The specification does not clarify how the `w` input affects state transitions. It seems to imply transitions are based on a single input (possibly `w`), but this needs clarification.

7. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - There is no mention of how the module should behave with invalid states or inputs outside the expected range.

8. **Implementation Notes:**
   - The specification asks for next-state logic for `y[1]`, but further clarification is needed regarding what should drive the output `Y1` and how it relates to FSM states.

**<ENHANCED_SPEC>**

**Module: TopModule**

**Interface:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `y`: 3-bit wide, unsigned input vector representing the current state. Follows LSB as `y[0]` and MSB as `y[2]`.
  - `w`: 1-bit unsigned input, used to determine state transitions.
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input for synchronous state transitions.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high asynchronous reset input to initialize the FSM to the starting state.

- **Outputs:**
  - `Y1`: 1-bit unsigned output, representing the state of `y[1]`.

**Behavior:**
- **State Machine Description:**
  - This FSM has six states encoded as `y = 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101` corresponding to states A, B, C, D, E, and F respectively.
  - State transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
  - Transitions are determined by the current state and the input `w` as follows:
    - State A: `y = 000`
      - If `w = 0` -> Transition to State B
      - If `w = 1` -> Remain in State A
    - State B: `y = 001`
      - If `w = 0` -> Transition to State C
      - If `w = 1` -> Transition to State D
    - State C: `y = 010`
      - If `w = 0` -> Transition to State E
      - If `w = 1` -> Transition to State D
    - State D: `y = 011`
      - If `w = 0` -> Transition to State F
      - If `w = 1` -> Transition to State A
    - State E: `y = 100`
      - If `w = 0` -> Remain in State E
      - If `w = 1` -> Transition to State D
    - State F: `y = 101`
      - If `w = 0` -> Transition to State C
      - If `w = 1` -> Transition to State D

- **Output Behavior:**
  - `Y1` is driven by the value of `y[1]`, providing a direct mapping from the state encoding.

**Timing and Reset Behavior:**
- **Clocking:**
  - The FSM transitions are synchronous with the rising edge of `clk`.

- **Reset:**
  - Upon assertion of `reset`, the FSM initializes to State A (`y = 000`), regardless of `clk`.

- **Initial State:**
  - The FSM starts in State A when reset is asserted.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Any invalid state not represented by the defined state codes should default to State A upon detection.

**Implementation Notes:**
- The next-state logic should be implemented for `y` to derive the transitions as described.
- Ensure that the output `Y1` continuously reflects the value of `y[1]`.
