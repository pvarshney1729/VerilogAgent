I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output q

The module should implement a combinational circuit. Read the simulation
waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

  time  a  b  c  d  q
  0ns   0  0  0  0  1
  5ns   0  0  0  0  1
  10ns  0  0  0  0  1
  15ns  0  0  0  0  1
  20ns  0  0  0  1  0
  25ns  0  0  1  0  0
  30ns  0  0  1  1  1
  35ns  0  1  0  0  0
  40ns  0  1  0  1  1
  45ns  0  1  1  0  1
  50ns  0  1  1  1  0
  55ns  1  0  0  0  0
  60ns  1  0  0  1  1
  65ns  1  0  1  0  1
  70ns  1  0  1  1  0
  75ns  1  1  0  0  1
  80ns  1  1  0  1  0
  85ns  1  1  1  0  0
  90ns  1  1  1  1  1

Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful to you:
                **Analysis of Ambiguities and Issues:**

1. **Implicit Port Widths and Types:** The specification states that all input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified. This is clear, but it's important to emphasize that these are single-bit, unsigned inputs and outputs.

2. **Signal Naming Conventions:** The names 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'q' are clear for a small combinational circuit, but in larger designs, more descriptive names might be beneficial.

3. **Combinational Circuit Specification:** The specification states that the circuit is combinational, but does not define the combinational logic explicitly. The behavior must be inferred from the waveform table.

4. **Timing Information:** The timings given (in nanoseconds) suggest a simulation environment, but since this is combinational logic, the specific timing is less relevant. The key point is that the output `q` should be a combinational function of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

5. **Waveform Table Interpretation:** The truth table is somewhat like a Karnaugh map. However, the logic condition that maps inputs to output `q` is not explicitly defined.

6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** All possible input combinations are considered in the table provided, but the logic extracting these conditions should be clearly defined.

**Module Name:** TopModule

**Interface:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire a`  // One-bit unsigned input
  - `input wire b`  // One-bit unsigned input
  - `input wire c`  // One-bit unsigned input
  - `input wire d`  // One-bit unsigned input
- **Output:**
  - `output wire q` // One-bit unsigned output

**Behavioral Description:**

The module implements a combinational logic circuit with the following truth table (derived from the waveform analysis):

| a | b | c | d | q |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Logical Expression:**

Based on the truth table, the logic for output `q` can be derived as follows (simplified using Boolean algebra):

\[ q = (a \land \overline{b} \land c) \lor (\overline{a} \land b \land \overline{c}) \lor (\overline{a} \land \overline{b} \land \overline{c} \land \overline{d}) \lor (a \land b \land \overline{c} \land \overline{d}) \]

**Implementation Notes:**

- The circuit is purely combinational; hence, no clock or reset signals are involved.
- The output `q` is directly and instantaneously determined by the logic function applied to the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- Ensure that the Verilog implementation is synthesizable and follows the logic expression derived above.

**Example Verilog Implementation:**

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire q
);

assign q = (a & ~b & c) | (~a & b & ~c) | (~a & ~b & ~c & ~d) | (a & b & ~c & ~d);

endmodule
```

**Verification:**
- Verification should involve comparing the Verilog simulation results with the provided truth table to ensure correct functionality.
