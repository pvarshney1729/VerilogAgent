Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. All input and output ports are 1-bit wide unless otherwise specified. The module's behavior is defined by a Moore state machine with two states. The reset is an active-high synchronous reset. The detailed specifications are as follows:\n\n- **Inputs:**\n  - `clk`: Clock signal for sequential logic operations.\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset input. When asserted (logic high), the state machine will transition to the initial state, OFF.\n  - `j`: Input signal to control state transitions from the OFF state.\n  - `k`: Input signal to control state transitions from the ON state.\n\n- **Output:**\n  - `out`: Output of the state machine, driven by the current state.\n\n- **State Definitions:**\n  - State `OFF`: Output `out = 0`\n  - State `ON`: Output `out = 1`\n\n- **State Transitions and Logic:**\n  1. **OFF State Transitions:**\n     - If `j = 0`, remain in the OFF state.\n     - If `j = 1`, transition to the ON state.\n\n  2. **ON State Transitions:**\n     - If `k = 0`, remain in the ON state.\n     - If `k = 1`, transition to the OFF state.\n\n- **Reset Behavior:**\n  - The reset is synchronous with the clock signal. When `reset` is high, the state machine transitions to the OFF state on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n  - On reset, the output `out` is set to 0.\n\n- **Clock and Timing Considerations:**\n  - The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n  - The output `out` is determined solely by the current state of the state machine, consistent with Moore machine principles.\n\n- **Initial Conditions:**\n  - Upon initialization or reset, the state machine should start in the OFF state, ensuring `out = 0`.\n\nThis specification defines a simple Moore state machine using a clocked synchronous reset and ensures clear behavior for each state transition and output condition.\n                    "
