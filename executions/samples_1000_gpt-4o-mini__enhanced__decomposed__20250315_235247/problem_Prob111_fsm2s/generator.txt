<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and specifications provided. The module is designed as a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are controlled by the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` is determined solely by the current state. The synchronous reset ensures that the state machine starts in the OFF state when the reset signal is high. 

The implementation uses a single always block for state transitions and another for output logic, adhering to the coding conventions specified. The use of `logic` for signal declarations ensures compatibility with modern Verilog standards. The sensitivity list for the sequential logic does not include the reset signal, as required for synchronous resets.

The state encoding is straightforward, with `OFF` represented as `1'b0` and `ON` as `1'b1`. The output is updated based on the current state, ensuring that it reflects the correct value according to the state machine's behavior.

Overall, the implementation is structured to be clear, maintainable, and compliant with the provided specifications and coding conventions.
