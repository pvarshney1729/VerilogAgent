Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.
  - `input in`: Data input stream, 1-bit.

- Output Ports:
  - `output disc`: Indicates a bit should be discarded, 1-bit.
  - `output flag`: Indicates the detection of a frame boundary, 1-bit.
  - `output err`: Indicates an error condition, 1-bit.

Design Requirements:
1. The module should implement a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to process a continuous bit stream (input `in`) and recognize specific bit patterns.

2. The FSM should detect the following patterns:
   - `0111110`: This pattern indicates that a bit needs to be discarded. The `disc` output should be asserted for one clock cycle, starting the cycle after this pattern is detected.
   - `01111110`: This pattern indicates a frame boundary. The `flag` output should be asserted for one clock cycle, starting the cycle after this pattern is detected.
   - `01111111...`: This pattern indicates an error due to 7 or more consecutive '1's. The `err` output should be asserted for one clock cycle, starting the cycle after this pattern is detected.

3. Initial State and Reset Behavior:
   - The FSM should start in an initial state that behaves as though the previous input was '0'.
   - On receiving a synchronous active-high reset signal, the FSM should return to the initial state.
   - All outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be deasserted upon reset.

4. Sequential Logic:
   - All state transitions and updates are to occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
   - Outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should reflect the FSM's state and be updated on the positive edge of `clk`.

5. Bit Indexing and Conventions:
   - Bit sequences are described from left (most significant bit) to right (least significant bit).
   - The input `in` is processed one bit per clock cycle.

6. Edge Cases:
   - If multiple patterns are detected simultaneously, the priority of outputs should be: `err` > `flag` > `disc`.
   - If an error condition (`01111111...`) is detected, the FSM should immediately assert `err` and not detect other patterns until reset or enough '0's are encountered to break the sequence of '1's.

This specification ensures the correct and efficient implementation of HDLC framing detection using a Moore-type FSM.
