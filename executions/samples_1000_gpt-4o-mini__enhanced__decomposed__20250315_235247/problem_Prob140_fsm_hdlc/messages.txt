        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n  - `input in`: Data input stream, 1-bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output disc`: Indicates a bit should be discarded, 1-bit.\n  - `output flag`: Indicates the detection of a frame boundary, 1-bit.\n  - `output err`: Indicates an error condition, 1-bit.\n\nDesign Requirements:\n1. The module should implement a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to process a continuous bit stream (input `in`) and recognize specific bit patterns.\n\n2. The FSM should detect the following patterns:\n   - `0111110`: This pattern indicates that a bit needs to be discarded. The `disc` output should be asserted for one clock cycle, starting the cycle after this pattern is detected.\n   - `01111110`: This pattern indicates a frame boundary. The `flag` output should be asserted for one clock cycle, starting the cycle after this pattern is detected.\n   - `01111111...`: This pattern indicates an error due to 7 or more consecutive '1's. The `err` output should be asserted for one clock cycle, starting the cycle after this pattern is detected.\n\n3. Initial State and Reset Behavior:\n   - The FSM should start in an initial state that behaves as though the previous input was '0'.\n   - On receiving a synchronous active-high reset signal, the FSM should return to the initial state.\n   - All outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be deasserted upon reset.\n\n4. Sequential Logic:\n   - All state transitions and updates are to occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - Outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should reflect the FSM's state and be updated on the positive edge of `clk`.\n\n5. Bit Indexing and Conventions:\n   - Bit sequences are described from left (most significant bit) to right (least significant bit).\n   - The input `in` is processed one bit per clock cycle.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - If multiple patterns are detected simultaneously, the priority of outputs should be: `err` > `flag` > `disc`.\n   - If an error condition (`01111111...`) is detected, the FSM should immediately assert `err` and not detect other patterns until reset or enough '0's are encountered to break the sequence of '1's.\n\nThis specification ensures the correct and efficient implementation of HDLC framing detection using a Moore-type FSM.\n                    "
