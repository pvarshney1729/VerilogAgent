<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named TopModule shall be implemented with the following interface specifications:

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock signal, used for triggering sequential logic, active on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal that initializes the LFSR to a predefined state when asserted.

- **Output:**
  - `q`: A 5-bit output vector representing the current state of the LFSR. The bits are indexed as `q[4:0]`, where `q[4]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

**Functional Description:**

The TopModule implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). This LFSR uses a specific arrangement that shifts bits to the right:

- **Bit Taps:** The LFSR has taps at bit positions 4 and 2 (`q[4]` and `q[2]` respectively). These positions are XORed with the LSB (`q[0]`) to produce their next state.

- **Operation:**
  - On each positive edge of the `clk` signal:
    - If `reset` is high, the LFSR shall be reset to the initial state `00001`.
    - If `reset` is low, the LFSR shall update its state as follows:
      - `q[4]` is updated to the result of `q[0] XOR q[4]`.
      - `q[3]` is updated to `q[4]`.
      - `q[2]` is updated to `q[3] XOR q[0]`.
      - `q[1]` is updated to `q[2]`.
      - `q[0]` is updated to `q[1]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The LFSR will never enter an all-zero state.
  - The sequence will cycle through all possible states except for the all-zero state, eventually returning to the initial state.

- **Initial State:** On reset activation, `q` shall be initialized to `00001`.

This setup ensures the LFSR covers all 31 possible non-zero states for a 5-bit register, achieving a maximum-length sequence.
