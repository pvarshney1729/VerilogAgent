        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named TopModule shall be implemented with the following interface specifications:\n\n- **Inputs:**\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, used for triggering sequential logic, active on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal that initializes the LFSR to a predefined state when asserted.\n\n- **Output:**\n  - `q`: A 5-bit output vector representing the current state of the LFSR. The bits are indexed as `q[4:0]`, where `q[4]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n**Functional Description:**\n\nThe TopModule implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). This LFSR uses a specific arrangement that shifts bits to the right:\n\n- **Bit Taps:** The LFSR has taps at bit positions 4 and 2 (`q[4]` and `q[2]` respectively). These positions are XORed with the LSB (`q[0]`) to produce their next state.\n\n- **Operation:**\n  - On each positive edge of the `clk` signal:\n    - If `reset` is high, the LFSR shall be reset to the initial state `00001`.\n    - If `reset` is low, the LFSR shall update its state as follows:\n      - `q[4]` is updated to the result of `q[0] XOR q[4]`.\n      - `q[3]` is updated to `q[4]`.\n      - `q[2]` is updated to `q[3] XOR q[0]`.\n      - `q[1]` is updated to `q[2]`.\n      - `q[0]` is updated to `q[1]`.\n\n- **Edge Cases:**\n  - The LFSR will never enter an all-zero state.\n  - The sequence will cycle through all possible states except for the all-zero state, eventually returning to the initial state.\n\n- **Initial State:** On reset activation, `q` shall be initialized to `00001`.\n\nThis setup ensures the LFSR covers all 31 possible non-zero states for a 5-bit register, achieving a maximum-length sequence.\n                    "
