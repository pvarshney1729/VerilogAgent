Module Name: TopModule

Interface:

- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input signal. The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.

- Outputs:
  - `q`: 32-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR. The output is indexed such that `q[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

Functionality:

- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- Taps are present at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0 (using zero-based indexing: `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]` respectively).
- The LFSR shifts right on each positive clock edge.
- The new value for each tapped bit position is determined by XORing the current LSB (`q[0]`) with the value at the respective tapped bit position.

Reset Behavior:

- The reset signal is synchronous to the `clk` and is active high.
- When `reset` is asserted, the output `q` is set to the initial value of `32'h1` on the next positive clock edge.
- If `reset` is deasserted, the LFSR resumes its normal operation.

Operation:

- During normal operation (when `reset` is low), the LFSR updates its state on each positive clock edge based on the current state and the tap positions.
- Non-tapped bits simply shift right without modification.
- The LFSR cycle will continue indefinitely, generating pseudo-random sequences of bits.

Edge Cases:

- Ensure that the LFSR does not get stuck in an all-zero state, as this can be a terminal state in an LFSR. However, given the initial value of `32'h1`, this situation should not occur unless manually interfered.
