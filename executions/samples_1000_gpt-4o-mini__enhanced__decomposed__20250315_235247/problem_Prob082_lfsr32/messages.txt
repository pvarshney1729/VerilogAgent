        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input signal. The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `q`: 32-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR. The output is indexed such that `q[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctionality:\n\n- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- Taps are present at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0 (using zero-based indexing: `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]` respectively).\n- The LFSR shifts right on each positive clock edge.\n- The new value for each tapped bit position is determined by XORing the current LSB (`q[0]`) with the value at the respective tapped bit position.\n\nReset Behavior:\n\n- The reset signal is synchronous to the `clk` and is active high.\n- When `reset` is asserted, the output `q` is set to the initial value of `32'h1` on the next positive clock edge.\n- If `reset` is deasserted, the LFSR resumes its normal operation.\n\nOperation:\n\n- During normal operation (when `reset` is low), the LFSR updates its state on each positive clock edge based on the current state and the tap positions.\n- Non-tapped bits simply shift right without modification.\n- The LFSR cycle will continue indefinitely, generating pseudo-random sequences of bits.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- Ensure that the LFSR does not get stuck in an all-zero state, as this can be a terminal state in an LFSR. However, given the initial value of `32'h1`, this situation should not occur unless manually interfered.\n                    "
