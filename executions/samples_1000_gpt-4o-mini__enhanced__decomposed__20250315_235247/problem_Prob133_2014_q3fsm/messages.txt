Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input clk: Clock signal. The module operates on the rising edge of this signal.\n- input reset: Active high synchronous reset. Resets the FSM to the initial state.\n- input s: Control signal for the FSM, evaluated in state A.\n- input w: Input signal evaluated in state B to determine the output.\n- output reg z: Output signal, set based on the evaluation of w.\n\nFinite State Machine Description:\n1. Initial State: A\n   - Upon reset (active high), the FSM enters state A.\n   - While in state A:\n     - If s = 0, remain in state A.\n     - If s = 1, transition to state B on the next rising edge of clk.\n\n2. State B:\n   - In state B, the FSM evaluates the input w over three consecutive clock cycles.\n   - A counter (3-bit wide, initialized to zero on each entry to state B) tracks the number of cycles w is equal to 1.\n   - After three clock cycles:\n     - If the counter value equals 2, set output z to 1 for one clock cycle.\n     - Otherwise, set z to 0.\n   - The FSM then resets the counter and continues checking w in a recurring three-cycle pattern within state B.\n\nSignal Characteristics:\n- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.\n- z is a registered output, updated on the rising edge of clk following the third cycle of evaluation in state B.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Reset (active high) is synchronized to the clk signal.\n- On reset, the FSM state is set to A and the output z is initialized to 0.\n\nOperational Notes:\n- The signal s influences only transitions from state A to B.\n- In state B, only the input w affects the output z.\n- The FSM uses minimal states to effectively manage operations as described.\n- Ensure proper synchronization with clk to avoid race conditions and ensure deterministic behavior.\n                    "
