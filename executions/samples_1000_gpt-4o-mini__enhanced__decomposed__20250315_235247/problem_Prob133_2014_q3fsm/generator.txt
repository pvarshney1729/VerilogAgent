The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specifications provided. The module consists of a finite state machine (FSM) with two states: State A and State B. 

1. **State A**: The FSM remains in this state as long as the input `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, the FSM transitions to State B.
2. **State B**: In this state, the FSM checks the input `w` for three consecutive clock cycles. A counter tracks how many times `w` is equal to 1 during these cycles. After three cycles, if `w` was 1 exactly two times, the output `z` is set to 1 for the next clock cycle; otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The FSM then resets the counter and continues checking `w` for the next three cycles.

The implementation ensures that the synchronous reset is handled correctly, initializing all registers and outputs to zero when the reset signal is high. The use of combinational logic is done with `always @(*)` for the next state logic, while the sequential logic for state transitions and output updates is handled in an `always @(posedge clk)` block.

The code adheres to the coding conventions specified, ensuring proper signal declarations and handling of the synchronous reset.
