Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input clk: Clock signal. The module operates on the rising edge of this signal.
- input reset: Active high synchronous reset. Resets the FSM to the initial state.
- input s: Control signal for the FSM, evaluated in state A.
- input w: Input signal evaluated in state B to determine the output.
- output reg z: Output signal, set based on the evaluation of w.

Finite State Machine Description:
1. Initial State: A
   - Upon reset (active high), the FSM enters state A.
   - While in state A:
     - If s = 0, remain in state A.
     - If s = 1, transition to state B on the next rising edge of clk.

2. State B:
   - In state B, the FSM evaluates the input w over three consecutive clock cycles.
   - A counter (3-bit wide, initialized to zero on each entry to state B) tracks the number of cycles w is equal to 1.
   - After three clock cycles:
     - If the counter value equals 2, set output z to 1 for one clock cycle.
     - Otherwise, set z to 0.
   - The FSM then resets the counter and continues checking w in a recurring three-cycle pattern within state B.

Signal Characteristics:
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.
- z is a registered output, updated on the rising edge of clk following the third cycle of evaluation in state B.

Reset Behavior:
- Reset (active high) is synchronized to the clk signal.
- On reset, the FSM state is set to A and the output z is initialized to 0.

Operational Notes:
- The signal s influences only transitions from state A to B.
- In state B, only the input w affects the output z.
- The FSM uses minimal states to effectively manage operations as described.
- Ensure proper synchronization with clk to avoid race conditions and ensure deterministic behavior.
