        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal used for state transitions.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous active-high reset signal. Resets the state machine to the initial state `OFF`.\n  - `j`: 1-bit input signal determining state transition from `OFF`.\n  - `k`: 1-bit input signal determining state transition from `ON`.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output signal reflecting the current state. It is `0` when the state is `OFF` and `1` when the state is `ON`.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Type: Moore State Machine\n- States:\n  - `OFF`: Initial state after reset. The output `out` is `0`.\n  - `ON`: The output `out` is `1`.\n\n- Transitions:\n  - From `OFF` state:\n    - If `j == 0`, remain in `OFF`.\n    - If `j == 1`, transition to `ON`.\n  - From `ON` state:\n    - If `k == 0`, remain in `ON`.\n    - If `k == 1`, transition to `OFF`.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active-high. When `areset` is asserted (`areset = 1`), the state is immediately set to `OFF` regardless of the clock signal, and the output `out` is set to `0`.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that all state transitions are synchronized with the rising edge of the `clk` signal, except for transitions triggered by the asynchronous reset.\n- Initial state after power-up or reset should be `OFF` with `out = 0`.\n- The state machine should be free of race conditions, with clear precedence given to the asynchronous reset over synchronous transitions.\n- Bit conventions: `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n                    "
