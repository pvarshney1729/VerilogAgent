<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` will follow the specifications of a Moore state machine with two states: `OFF` and `ON`. The module will have an asynchronous reset (`areset`) that sets the state to `OFF` and the output to `0`. The state transitions will depend on the inputs `j` and `k` as described in the specification. 

1. **State Declaration**: I will define two states using a parameterized approach for clarity.
2. **State Register**: The current state will be stored in a flip-flop that updates on the rising edge of the clock unless reset.
3. **Output Logic**: The output will be directly tied to the current state, as per Moore machine design.
4. **Next State Logic**: The next state will be determined based on the current state and the inputs `j` and `k`.
5. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset will be handled in the sequential block to ensure that it takes precedence over the clocked behavior.

The implementation will adhere to the provided guidelines and coding conventions, ensuring that all signals are declared as `logic` and that the sensitivity list is correctly implemented.
