Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- `input wire clk` : Clock input, used to synchronize all sequential elements. Triggered on the positive edge.
- `input wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset. When high, it resets the module to its initial state.
- `input wire data` : Input data stream, one bit per clock cycle.
- `output reg start_shifting` : Output signal that becomes high when the sequence 1101 is detected and remains high until reset.

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that monitors an incoming bit stream (`data`) for the occurrence of the bit sequence `1101`. 

FSM States:
- Define states using a binary encoding, for example, `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, and `FOUND`.
  - `S0`: Initial state, waiting for the first `1`.
  - `S1`: First `1` detected, waiting for the next `1`.
  - `S2`: Second `1` detected, waiting for `0`.
  - `S3`: Detected `110`, waiting for the final `1`.
  - `FOUND`: Sequence `1101` detected.

State Transitions:
- On reset = 1: Transition to `S0`.
- On positive clock edge when reset = 0:
  - `S0` -> `S1` if `data` = 1; remain `S0` if `data` = 0.
  - `S1` -> `S2` if `data` = 1; back to `S0` if `data` = 0.
  - `S2` -> `S3` if `data` = 0; remain `S2` if `data` = 1.
  - `S3` -> `FOUND` if `data` = 1; back to `S0` if `data` = 0.
  - `FOUND`: Remain in `FOUND` until reset = 1.

Output Logic:
- `start_shifting` is set to `1` when the FSM reaches the `FOUND` state.
- `start_shifting` remains `1` until reset is activated.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous, meaning the FSM transitions to the initial state `S0` on the next rising edge of the clock when `reset` is high.
- Upon reset, `start_shifting` is set to `0`.

Edge Cases:
- If `reset` is asserted, the FSM should immediately move to the initial state on the next clock cycle, regardless of the current state.
- Overlapping sequences are detected. For example, the stream `1101101` will trigger `start_shifting` after detecting the first occurrence of `1101`.

Initial Conditions:
- At startup, the FSM should be in the `S0` state and `start_shifting` should be `0` until the sequence is detected.
