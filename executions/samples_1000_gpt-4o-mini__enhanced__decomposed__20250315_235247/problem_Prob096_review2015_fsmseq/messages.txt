        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPorts:\n- `input wire clk` : Clock input, used to synchronize all sequential elements. Triggered on the positive edge.\n- `input wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset. When high, it resets the module to its initial state.\n- `input wire data` : Input data stream, one bit per clock cycle.\n- `output reg start_shifting` : Output signal that becomes high when the sequence 1101 is detected and remains high until reset.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that monitors an incoming bit stream (`data`) for the occurrence of the bit sequence `1101`. \n\nFSM States:\n- Define states using a binary encoding, for example, `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, and `FOUND`.\n  - `S0`: Initial state, waiting for the first `1`.\n  - `S1`: First `1` detected, waiting for the next `1`.\n  - `S2`: Second `1` detected, waiting for `0`.\n  - `S3`: Detected `110`, waiting for the final `1`.\n  - `FOUND`: Sequence `1101` detected.\n\nState Transitions:\n- On reset = 1: Transition to `S0`.\n- On positive clock edge when reset = 0:\n  - `S0` -> `S1` if `data` = 1; remain `S0` if `data` = 0.\n  - `S1` -> `S2` if `data` = 1; back to `S0` if `data` = 0.\n  - `S2` -> `S3` if `data` = 0; remain `S2` if `data` = 1.\n  - `S3` -> `FOUND` if `data` = 1; back to `S0` if `data` = 0.\n  - `FOUND`: Remain in `FOUND` until reset = 1.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- `start_shifting` is set to `1` when the FSM reaches the `FOUND` state.\n- `start_shifting` remains `1` until reset is activated.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning the FSM transitions to the initial state `S0` on the next rising edge of the clock when `reset` is high.\n- Upon reset, `start_shifting` is set to `0`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If `reset` is asserted, the FSM should immediately move to the initial state on the next clock cycle, regardless of the current state.\n- Overlapping sequences are detected. For example, the stream `1101101` will trigger `start_shifting` after detecting the first occurrence of `1101`.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- At startup, the FSM should be in the `S0` state and `start_shifting` should be `0` until the sequence is detected.\n                    "
