The implementation of the `TopModule` will follow the specifications provided. The module will consist of a finite state machine (FSM) that detects the bit pattern `1101`, shifts in 4 bits to determine the duration for counting, waits for the counting to finish, and then notifies the user. The FSM will have the following states: IDLE, WAIT_FOR_PATTERN, SHIFT, COUNTING, and DONE. 

1. **State Definitions**: The states will be defined using an enumerated type for clarity.
2. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM will reset to the IDLE state on the rising edge of the `reset` signal.
3. **Pattern Detection**: The FSM will transition to the SHIFT state upon detecting the `1101` pattern.
4. **Shifting Logic**: The `shift_ena` signal will be asserted for 4 clock cycles to allow for shifting in additional bits.
5. **Counting Logic**: The FSM will assert the `counting` signal while waiting for the `done_counting` signal to indicate that the counting is complete.
6. **Notification Logic**: The `done` signal will be asserted to notify the user, and the FSM will wait for the `ack` signal before returning to the IDLE state.

The implementation will ensure that all signals are declared as `logic`, and the combinational logic will use the `always @(*)` construct. The code will adhere to the specified interface and signal names, and it will handle the timing and transitions correctly.
