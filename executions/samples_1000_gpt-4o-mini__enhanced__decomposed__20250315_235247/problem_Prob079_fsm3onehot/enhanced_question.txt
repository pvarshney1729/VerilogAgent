<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Specification: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `in`: A 1-bit input signal.
  - `state`: A 4-bit input signal representing the current state in a one-hot encoded format.
- Output Ports:
  - `next_state`: A 4-bit output signal representing the next state in a one-hot encoded format.
  - `out`: A 1-bit output signal representing the output of the Moore state machine.

Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: `state[0]` and `next_state[0]` refer to the least significant bit (LSB).
- State Encoding (One-Hot):
  - State A: 4'b0001
  - State B: 4'b0010
  - State C: 4'b0100
  - State D: 4'b1000

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with four distinct states: A, B, C, and D.
- State transitions and outputs are determined by the current state and the `in` input signal.

State Transition Table:
- Current State | `in` = 0 | `in` = 1
- A             | A        | B
- B             | C        | B
- C             | A        | D
- D             | C        | B

Output Logic:
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state:
  - In state D, `out` = 1.
  - In all other states (A, B, C), `out` = 0.

Implementation Notes:
- The module is purely combinational with no sequential elements.
- Ensure that the next state and output logic correctly reflects the state transition table and output logic described.
- Edge cases or invalid states (e.g., multiple bits set in `state`) are not explicitly addressed; assume valid one-hot encoding at all times.

Reset and Initialization:
- Not applicable as the module does not include sequential elements or registers.
