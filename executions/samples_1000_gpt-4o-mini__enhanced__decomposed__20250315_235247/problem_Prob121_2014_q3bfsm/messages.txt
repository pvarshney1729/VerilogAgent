Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal for the module, active on the positive edge.\n- `input reset`: Synchronous active high reset signal. Resetting the FSM should set it to the initial state 000.\n- `input x`: Input signal affecting the state transition.\n- `output z`: Output signal determined by the current state and input.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Specifications:\n- State Encoding: The FSM uses a 3-bit state encoding represented by `y[2:0]`, where `y[2]` is the most significant bit and `y[0]` is the least significant bit.\n- Initial State: Upon reset, the FSM should transition to state 000.\n- State Transitions: The FSM transitions between states on the rising edge of the `clk` signal. The transitions are defined as follows:\n\n  | Present State (y[2:0]) | Next State if x=0 (y[2:0]) | Next State if x=1 (y[2:0]) | Output (z) |\n  |-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n  | 000                     | 000                        | 001                        | 0          |\n  | 001                     | 001                        | 100                        | 0          |\n  | 010                     | 010                        | 001                        | 0          |\n  | 011                     | 001                        | 010                        | 1          |\n  | 100                     | 011                        | 100                        | 1          |\n\nBehavioral Notes:\n- The FSM is triggered by the positive edge of `clk` and will only change states at these edges.\n- The `reset` signal is synchronous, meaning the FSM will only reset to state 000 on the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.\n- The output `z` is determined by the present state. It remains constant throughout the clock cycle and only updates on the next clock edge in accordance with the transition rules.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure that the FSM can handle all transitions correctly regardless of the input `x`.\n- The module does not define behavior for states other than those specified, ensuring the FSM operates correctly from any valid state.\n                    "
