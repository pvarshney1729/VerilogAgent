Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge triggered.
  - `input wire reset`: Active high synchronous reset.
  - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg out`: Single-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.
- The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:

  | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
  |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
  | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |
  | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |
  | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |
  | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |

- The FSM uses a synchronous active high reset. When `reset` is asserted, the FSM transitions to State A on the next positive clock edge.
- The output `out` is determined by the current state and is updated at the positive edge of the clock.

Implementation Details:
- All sequential elements (flip-flops) are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning it takes effect on the next clock edge when `reset` is high.
- The initial state of the FSM upon reset is State A. In this state, the output `out` is set to 0.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit wide.
- There are no undefined states; the FSM always transitions between the specified states based on the input `in`.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The reset signal is assumed to be glitch-free and reliably asserts for at least one clock cycle.
- The input `in` is assumed to be stable during the clock edge.
- No metastability concerns are addressed, assuming clean input signals.

Note: Ensure all sequential logic is correctly synchronized with the clock and reset signals.
