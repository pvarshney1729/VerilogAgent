Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge triggered.\n  - `input wire reset`: Active high synchronous reset.\n  - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg out`: Single-bit output signal.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.\n- The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:\n\n  | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |\n  |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n  | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |\n  | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |\n  | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |\n  | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |\n\n- The FSM uses a synchronous active high reset. When `reset` is asserted, the FSM transitions to State A on the next positive clock edge.\n- The output `out` is determined by the current state and is updated at the positive edge of the clock.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- All sequential elements (flip-flops) are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning it takes effect on the next clock edge when `reset` is high.\n- The initial state of the FSM upon reset is State A. In this state, the output `out` is set to 0.\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit wide.\n- There are no undefined states; the FSM always transitions between the specified states based on the input `in`.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The reset signal is assumed to be glitch-free and reliably asserts for at least one clock cycle.\n- The input `in` is assumed to be stable during the clock edge.\n- No metastability concerns are addressed, assuming clean input signals.\n\nNote: Ensure all sequential logic is correctly synchronized with the clock and reset signals.\n                    "
