Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous reset input. The state machine resets to state A on the positive edge of this signal.\n  - `in`: 1-bit data input signal.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `out`: 1-bit data output signal.\n\nState Machine:\n- Type: Moore state machine\n- States: Four states, labeled A, B, C, and D.\n- State Encoding: Utilize a 2-bit state register to encode the states.\n  - State A: 2'b00\n  - State B: 2'b01\n  - State C: 2'b10\n  - State D: 2'b11\n\nState Transition Table:\n- Current State | Next State with in=0 | Next State with in=1 | Output\n  - A (00)      | A (00)               | B (01)               | 0\n  - B (01)      | C (10)               | B (01)               | 0\n  - C (10)      | A (00)               | D (11)               | 0\n  - D (11)      | C (10)               | B (01)               | 1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is asynchronous and active on the positive edge of `areset`.\n- Upon reset, the state machine returns to state A (2'b00).\n- All flip-flops and registers involved in the state machine should initialize to 0 on reset.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The `out` output is determined solely by the current state, not the input `in`.\n- The output is 0 for states A, B, and C, and 1 for state D.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Use the convention that bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the state transitions and output behavior are defined for all combinations of current state and `in` input.\n- Handle any potential race conditions by ensuring that the state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock, and the reset is properly synchronized.\n\nDependencies:\n- The state transitions depend on both the current state and the input `in`.\n- Output depends only on the current state.\n\nAll logic should conform to the above specifications for consistent and correct behavior of the state machine.\n                    "
