Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous reset input. The state machine resets to state A on the positive edge of this signal.
  - `in`: 1-bit data input signal.

- Outputs:
  - `out`: 1-bit data output signal.

State Machine:
- Type: Moore state machine
- States: Four states, labeled A, B, C, and D.
- State Encoding: Utilize a 2-bit state register to encode the states.
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table:
- Current State | Next State with in=0 | Next State with in=1 | Output
  - A (00)      | A (00)               | B (01)               | 0
  - B (01)      | C (10)               | B (01)               | 0
  - C (10)      | A (00)               | D (11)               | 0
  - D (11)      | C (10)               | B (01)               | 1

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is asynchronous and active on the positive edge of `areset`.
- Upon reset, the state machine returns to state A (2'b00).
- All flip-flops and registers involved in the state machine should initialize to 0 on reset.

Output Logic:
- The `out` output is determined solely by the current state, not the input `in`.
- The output is 0 for states A, B, and C, and 1 for state D.

Bit Indexing:
- Use the convention that bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state transitions and output behavior are defined for all combinations of current state and `in` input.
- Handle any potential race conditions by ensuring that the state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock, and the reset is properly synchronized.

Dependencies:
- The state transitions depend on both the current state and the input `in`.
- Output depends only on the current state.

All logic should conform to the above specifications for consistent and correct behavior of the state machine.
