Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: Clock signal (1-bit), positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: Active-high synchronous reset (1-bit).
  - in: Serial data input (1-bit).

- Output Ports:
  - done: Indicates successful reception of a complete byte (1-bit).

Port and Signal Conventions:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide unless otherwise specified.
- The signal 'in' represents the serial data stream.

Operation Description:
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol with the following format:
  - 1 Start Bit: Logic '0'.
  - 8 Data Bits: Transmitted least significant bit (LSB) first.
  - 1 Stop Bit: Logic '1'.
  - Idle Line: Logic '1' when no data is transmitted.

FSM Behavior:
- The FSM detects the start of a new byte when it sees a transition from idle (logic '1') to a start bit (logic '0').
- After detecting the start bit, the FSM will sequentially read the next 8 bits as data bits.
- Following the 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (logic '1').
- If the stop bit is detected correctly, the 'done' output will be asserted (logic '1') for one clock cycle, indicating successful byte reception.
- If the stop bit is incorrect (logic '0'), the FSM will ignore subsequent bits until a valid stop bit (logic '1') is detected to reset the byte reception process.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and active-high, initializing the FSM to its idle state on the next positive clock edge when 'reset' is asserted.
- After reset, the FSM will begin monitoring the 'in' signal for a start bit.

Operational Edge Cases:
- The FSM handles continuous idle conditions by remaining in the idle state until a start bit is detected.
- If noise or errors lead to unexpected transitions, the FSM will wait for a valid stop bit before restarting byte detection.

Implementation Notes:
- All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.
- Initial states and conditions must be explicitly defined for all sequential elements in the FSM.
