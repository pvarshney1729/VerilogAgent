<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specifications provided in the question. The module is designed to receive a serial data stream consisting of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The finite state machine (FSM) will manage the states of the reception process, transitioning through IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP states. The synchronous reset ensures that the FSM can be reset to the IDLE state on the next clock edge when the reset signal is asserted. The done signal will be asserted for one clock cycle when a complete byte is successfully received.

The implementation adheres to the coding conventions and guidelines specified, including the use of logic types, proper sensitivity lists, and ensuring that all signals are initialized correctly. The FSM logic is implemented using combinational and sequential always blocks to manage state transitions and output signals.
