Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: Clock signal (1-bit), positive edge-triggered.\n  - reset: Active-high synchronous reset (1-bit).\n  - in: Serial data input (1-bit).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - done: Indicates successful reception of a complete byte (1-bit).\n\nPort and Signal Conventions:\n- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide unless otherwise specified.\n- The signal 'in' represents the serial data stream.\n\nOperation Description:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol with the following format:\n  - 1 Start Bit: Logic '0'.\n  - 8 Data Bits: Transmitted least significant bit (LSB) first.\n  - 1 Stop Bit: Logic '1'.\n  - Idle Line: Logic '1' when no data is transmitted.\n\nFSM Behavior:\n- The FSM detects the start of a new byte when it sees a transition from idle (logic '1') to a start bit (logic '0').\n- After detecting the start bit, the FSM will sequentially read the next 8 bits as data bits.\n- Following the 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (logic '1').\n- If the stop bit is detected correctly, the 'done' output will be asserted (logic '1') for one clock cycle, indicating successful byte reception.\n- If the stop bit is incorrect (logic '0'), the FSM will ignore subsequent bits until a valid stop bit (logic '1') is detected to reset the byte reception process.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous and active-high, initializing the FSM to its idle state on the next positive clock edge when 'reset' is asserted.\n- After reset, the FSM will begin monitoring the 'in' signal for a start bit.\n\nOperational Edge Cases:\n- The FSM handles continuous idle conditions by remaining in the idle state until a start bit is detected.\n- If noise or errors lead to unexpected transitions, the FSM will wait for a valid stop bit before restarting byte detection.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.\n- Initial states and conditions must be explicitly defined for all sequential elements in the FSM.\n                    "
