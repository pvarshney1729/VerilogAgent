<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specified requirements for processing a PS/2 mouse protocol message. The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) to identify the start of a message based on the input signal `in[3]`. The FSM transitions through different states to count the bytes received and signals when a complete message (three bytes) has been received.

1. **State Definition**: The FSM has four states: `IDLE`, `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `DONE`. The `IDLE` state waits for the first byte with `in[3]` set to 1. The `BYTE1`, `BYTE2`, and `DONE` states handle the subsequent bytes and signal completion.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset signal is implemented as a synchronous reset, ensuring that the FSM resets to the `IDLE` state when the reset signal is high.

3. **Byte Counting**: The FSM counts the number of bytes received after detecting the first byte of a message. It transitions to the `DONE` state after receiving the third byte.

4. **Output Signal**: The `done` output is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte is received.

5. **Combinational Logic**: The state transitions and output logic are handled in separate always blocks, adhering to the coding conventions provided.

The final implementation is structured to ensure clarity and correctness, following all guidelines and conventions specified.
