        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: `clk` (1 bit) - Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- Input: `reset` (1 bit) - Active high, synchronous reset.\n- Input: `in` (8 bits) - Data byte from the PS/2 mouse protocol. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit, and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit.\n- Output: `done` (1 bit) - Indicates the successful reception of a complete three-byte message.\n\nSpecifications and Operation:\n1. The module processes a continuous stream of 8-bit bytes according to the PS/2 mouse protocol, which organizes data into messages of three bytes each.\n\n2. Message Identification:\n   - The first byte of a message is identified by `in[3]` being set to 1. The other two bytes of the message may have `in[3]` set to either 0 or 1.\n\n3. Finite State Machine (FSM) Design:\n   - The FSM will discard bytes until it encounters a byte where `in[3]` equals 1, indicating the start of a new message.\n   - Upon detection of the first byte of a message, the FSM transitions to a state that expects the next two bytes.\n   - After receiving the third byte of a message, the FSM will assert the `done` output high for one clock cycle in the cycle immediately following the reception of the third byte.\n   - The FSM then returns to its initial state to search for the start of the next message.\n\n4. Clock and Reset Behavior:\n   - All sequential elements within the FSM are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n   - The `reset` signal is synchronous, and when asserted high, it resets the FSM to its initial state, ensuring that no partial message processing is retained.\n\n5. Initial Conditions:\n   - Upon power-up or reset, the FSM should be in a state where it is ready to search for the first byte of a message.\n\n6. Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n   - The FSM should be robust against continuous input streams and handle cases where `in[3]` is not set for an extended period.\n   - The module should correctly identify and signal message boundaries even when messages are immediately sequential without idle bytes between them.\n\nBy following this specification, the FSM will correctly identify and process the three-byte messages according to the PS/2 mouse protocol.\n                    "
