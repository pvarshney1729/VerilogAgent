Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- `input  wire clk` : Clock signal, used for synchronous operations.
- `input  wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- `input  wire in` : Single-bit input signal.
- `output reg out` : Single-bit output signal.

Specification:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: State A and State B.
- State Encoding: 
  - State A: 1'b0
  - State B: 1'b1
- Initial State: On reset, the state machine transitions to State B.
- Reset Behavior: The reset signal is active-high and synchronous, meaning the state machine transitions to the reset state (State B) on the rising edge of the clock when the reset signal is high.
- Output Logic:
  - In State B, the output `out` is set to 1.
  - In State A, the output `out` is set to 0.
- State Transitions:
  - From State B:
    - If `in` = 0, transition to State A.
    - If `in` = 1, remain in State B.
  - From State A:
    - If `in` = 0, transition to State B.
    - If `in` = 1, remain in State A.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All signals are single bits; no additional bit indexing is necessary.
- The output and state transitions are updated on the rising edge of the clock.

Edge Case Handling:
- Ensure the reset signal is not asserted during normal operation to avoid unintended state transitions.
- The state machine should handle all input combinations, ensuring no undefined states.
