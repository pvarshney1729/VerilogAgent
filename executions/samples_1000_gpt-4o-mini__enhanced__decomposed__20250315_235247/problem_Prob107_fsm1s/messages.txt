Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- `input  wire clk` : Clock signal, used for synchronous operations.\n- `input  wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- `input  wire in` : Single-bit input signal.\n- `output reg out` : Single-bit output signal.\n\nSpecification:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: State A and State B.\n- State Encoding: \n  - State A: 1'b0\n  - State B: 1'b1\n- Initial State: On reset, the state machine transitions to State B.\n- Reset Behavior: The reset signal is active-high and synchronous, meaning the state machine transitions to the reset state (State B) on the rising edge of the clock when the reset signal is high.\n- Output Logic:\n  - In State B, the output `out` is set to 1.\n  - In State A, the output `out` is set to 0.\n- State Transitions:\n  - From State B:\n    - If `in` = 0, transition to State A.\n    - If `in` = 1, remain in State B.\n  - From State A:\n    - If `in` = 0, transition to State B.\n    - If `in` = 1, remain in State A.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- All signals are single bits; no additional bit indexing is necessary.\n- The output and state transitions are updated on the rising edge of the clock.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Ensure the reset signal is not asserted during normal operation to avoid unintended state transitions.\n- The state machine should handle all input combinations, ensuring no undefined states.\n                    "
