        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input clk: System clock signal for sequential logic.\n- input areset: Asynchronous active-high reset signal.\n- input in: 1-bit input signal.\n- output reg out: 1-bit output signal representing the Moore machine's output.\n\nState Definitions:\n- State B: Encoded as 1. Output in this state is '1'.\n- State A: Encoded as 0. Output in this state is '0'.\n\nState Transition Diagram:\n- From State B (Output = 1):\n  - If in == 0, transition to State A.\n  - If in == 1, remain in State B.\n- From State A (Output = 0):\n  - If in == 0, transition to State B.\n  - If in == 1, remain in State A.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module will asynchronously reset to State B when the areset signal is high. During reset, the output will be '1', corresponding to State B.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- The state transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n- The reset is asynchronous, meaning it takes effect immediately when areset is high, regardless of the clk signal.\n- The out signal is updated based on the current state and is independent of the input signal.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- On release of areset, the state transitions will resume based on the in signal at the next rising edge of clk.\n- Ensure that transitions are stable and avoid race conditions by latching inputs appropriately at the rising edge of clk.\n\nEnd of Specification\n                    "
