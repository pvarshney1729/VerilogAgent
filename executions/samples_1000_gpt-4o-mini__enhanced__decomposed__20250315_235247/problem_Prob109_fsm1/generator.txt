<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, I will create a Moore state machine with two states: A and B. The output will depend solely on the current state, with state B producing an output of '1' and state A producing an output of '0'. The state transitions will be defined based on the input signal `in`. The module will also include an asynchronous reset that sets the state to B when activated. 

I will follow the coding conventions provided, ensuring that all signals are declared as logic, using the appropriate sensitivity list, and adhering to the specified interface. The implementation will ensure that the output is updated based on the current state, and the state transitions will be handled correctly in the always block.

module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic areset,
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);
    logic state; // 0 for A, 1 for B

    // Asynchronous reset and state transition logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            state <= 1'b1; // Reset to state B
        end else begin
            case (state)
                1'b1: begin // State B
                    if (in == 1'b0) 
                        state <= 1'b0; // Transition to A
                    // Stay in B if in == 1
                end
                1'b0: begin // State A
                    if (in == 1'b0) 
                        state <= 1'b1; // Transition to B
                    // Stay in A if in == 1
                end
            endcase

    // Output logic based on the current state
    assign out = state; // Output is 1 when in state B, 0 when in state A
