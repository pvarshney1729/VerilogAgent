<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input clk: System clock signal for sequential logic.
- input areset: Asynchronous active-high reset signal.
- input in: 1-bit input signal.
- output reg out: 1-bit output signal representing the Moore machine's output.

State Definitions:
- State B: Encoded as 1. Output in this state is '1'.
- State A: Encoded as 0. Output in this state is '0'.

State Transition Diagram:
- From State B (Output = 1):
  - If in == 0, transition to State A.
  - If in == 1, remain in State B.
- From State A (Output = 0):
  - If in == 0, transition to State B.
  - If in == 1, remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- The module will asynchronously reset to State B when the areset signal is high. During reset, the output will be '1', corresponding to State B.

Implementation Details:
- The state transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The reset is asynchronous, meaning it takes effect immediately when areset is high, regardless of the clk signal.
- The out signal is updated based on the current state and is independent of the input signal.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- On release of areset, the state transitions will resume based on the in signal at the next rising edge of clk.
- Ensure that transitions are stable and avoid race conditions by latching inputs appropriately at the rising edge of clk.
