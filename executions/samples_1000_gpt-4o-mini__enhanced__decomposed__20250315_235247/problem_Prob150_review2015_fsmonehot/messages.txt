Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire d` (1-bit)\n  - `input wire done_counting` (1-bit)\n  - `input wire ack` (1-bit)\n  - `input wire [9:0] state` (10-bit, one-hot encoded current state)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire B3_next` (1-bit, asserts when next state is B3)\n  - `output wire S_next` (1-bit, asserts when next state is S)\n  - `output wire S1_next` (1-bit, asserts when next state is S1)\n  - `output wire Count_next` (1-bit, asserts when next state is Count)\n  - `output wire Wait_next` (1-bit, asserts when next state is Wait)\n  - `output wire done` (1-bit, active when done)\n  - `output wire counting` (1-bit, active when counting)\n  - `output wire shift_ena` (1-bit, active when shift is enabled)\n\nState Machine:\n- The state machine is a Moore type with three primary inputs: `d`, `done_counting`, `ack`.\n- Outputs are generally zero unless explicitly specified in the transition table.\n\nState Transition Table:\n- State transitions are based on inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack`.\n- The following state transitions are defined:\n  - `S` transitions to `S` when `d=0` and to `S1` when `d=1`.\n  - `S1` transitions to `S` when `d=0` and to `S11` when `d=1`.\n  - `S11` transitions to `S110` when `d=0` and remains in `S11` when `d=1`.\n  - `S110` transitions to `S` when `d=0` and to `B0` when `d=1`.\n  - `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, and `B3` transitions are automatic (move to the next state in sequence).\n  - `Count` remains in `Count` when `done_counting=0` and transitions to `Wait` when `done_counting=1`.\n  - `Wait` remains in `Wait` when `ack=0` and transitions to `S` when `ack=1`.\n\nState Encoding:\n- One-hot encoding is utilized for state representation:\n  - `S = 10'b0000000001`\n  - `S1 = 10'b0000000010`\n  - `S11 = 10'b0000000100`\n  - `S110 = 10'b0000001000`\n  - `B0 = 10'b0000010000`\n  - `B1 = 10'b0000100000`\n  - `B2 = 10'b0001000000`\n  - `B3 = 10'b0010000000`\n  - `Count = 10'b0100000000`\n  - `Wait = 10'b1000000000`\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The state machine initializes to the `S` state on reset.\n- The reset is assumed to be asynchronous unless otherwise specified. All flip-flops are reset to their initial state as described in the state encoding.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- `shift_ena` is asserted in states `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, `B3`.\n- `counting` is asserted in the `Count` state.\n- `done` is asserted in the `Wait` state.\n\nDerived Logic:\n- Next-state signals (`B3_next`, `S_next`, `S1_next`, `Count_next`, `Wait_next`) are combinational outputs derived from the current state and input conditions.\n- The module is responsible for generating these signals based on the described state transitions and output conditions.\n                    "
