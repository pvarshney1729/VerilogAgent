     * Behavior Description:
     * The module captures transitions of the input vector 'in' from 1 to 0 at each bit position.
     * When a bit in 'in' transitions from 1 to 0, the corresponding bit in 'out' is set to 1.
     * The bits in 'out' will remain set until a high signal is received on the 'reset' input.
     * The output will be cleared to 0 upon reset.
     */

        end else begin
            out <= (in ^ (in >> 1)) & in; // Set output bits to 1 for transitions from 1 to 0
        end
    end

    /*
     * Edge Case Handling:
     * The output remains unchanged if the input does not change or if multiple bits change simultaneously.
     * This design assumes that the input changes are registered at the clock edge.
