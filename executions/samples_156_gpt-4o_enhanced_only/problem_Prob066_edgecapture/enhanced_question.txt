Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit). The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `reset`: Active high synchronous reset (1 bit). When high, the module resets all outputs to their initial state.
  - `in`: 32-bit input vector. Each bit can independently trigger a capture event.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 32-bit output vector. Each bit corresponds to a respective bit in the input vector.

Port and Signal Conventions:
- The `in` and `out` ports are 32 bits wide, with bit indexing ranging from 31 (most significant bit) to 0 (least significant bit).

Operational Details:
- The module monitors each bit in the `in` vector. If a bit transitions from 1 to 0 between consecutive clock cycles, the corresponding bit in the `out` vector is set to 1.
- Once a bit in the `out` vector is set to 1, it remains 1 until the module is reset.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and active high. During the positive edge of the clock, if `reset` is high, all bits in the `out` vector are set to 0.
- The reset affects the output on the next clock edge after `reset` is asserted.

Initial Conditions:
- At power-up or after a reset, all bits in the `out` vector are initialized to 0.

Clock and Timing:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- The `in` vector is sampled at each positive edge of the clock.

Edge Case Handling:
- If the `in` vector is constant or transitions from 0 to 1, the `out` vector remains unaffected.
- Race conditions are avoided by ensuring all logic is synchronous to the `clk` signal with a clearly defined reset behavior. 

This specification ensures a clear and precise implementation of the desired functionality, with explicit signal dependencies and timing relationships.
