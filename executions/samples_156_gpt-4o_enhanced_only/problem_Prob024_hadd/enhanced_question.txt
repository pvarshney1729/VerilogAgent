Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic a;` // Single-bit input, represents the first addend.
  - `input logic b;` // Single-bit input, represents the second addend.

- Output Ports:
  - `output logic sum;` // Single-bit output, represents the sum of the inputs.
  - `output logic cout;` // Single-bit output, represents the carry-out of the addition.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a half adder, which is a combinational logic circuit.
- The half adder takes two single-bit binary numbers `a` and `b` as inputs and produces two single-bit outputs: `sum` and `cout`.
- The `sum` output is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`.
- The `cout` output is the result of the bitwise AND operation between `a` and `b`.

Bit Indexing and Significance:
- Both inputs and outputs are single-bit wide, with no bit indexing required.
- The inputs `a` and `b` are considered as the least significant bits for addition.

Operational Details:
- The logic operations involved are strictly combinational and there are no sequential elements, thus no clock or reset is required.
- There are no race conditions as the operations are purely bitwise and independent of any clock cycles.

Edge Cases:
- The module correctly handles all possible input combinations of `a` and `b`, i.e., (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
- The results for these combinations are:
  - (0,0): sum = 0, cout = 0
  - (0,1): sum = 1, cout = 0
  - (1,0): sum = 1, cout = 0
  - (1,1): sum = 0, cout = 1
