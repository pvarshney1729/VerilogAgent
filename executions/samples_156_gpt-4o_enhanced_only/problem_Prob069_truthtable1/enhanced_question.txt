Specification for TopModule:

Module Name: TopModule

1. Port Definitions:
   - Input Ports:
     - `input wire x3`: Single-bit input representing the most significant bit.
     - `input wire x2`: Single-bit input.
     - `input wire x1`: Single-bit input representing the least significant bit.
   - Output Ports:
     - `output wire f`: Single-bit output.

2. Signal Conventions:
   - All signals are active-high.
   - Bit Indexing: `x3` is the most significant bit, and `x1` is the least significant bit in terms of input priority.

3. Circuit Description:
   - The module is a purely combinational logic circuit with no internal state or memory elements.
   - The output `f` is determined directly from the input combination according to the specified truth table.

4. Truth Table Implementation:
   - The truth table for the module is as follows:

     | x3 | x2 | x1 | f |
     |----|----|----|---|
     |  0 |  0 |  0 | 0 |
     |  0 |  0 |  1 | 0 |
     |  0 |  1 |  0 | 1 |
     |  0 |  1 |  1 | 1 |
     |  1 |  0 |  0 | 0 |
     |  1 |  0 |  1 | 1 |
     |  1 |  1 |  0 | 0 |
     |  1 |  1 |  1 | 1 |

   - The output `f` can be expressed in boolean logic as:
     - `f = (x2 & ~x3) | (x1 & x3) | (x1 & x2)`

5. Special Conditions:
   - There are no asynchronous or synchronous resets involved, as the module is strictly combinational.
   - The behavior is defined for all possible combinations of the inputs `x3`, `x2`, and `x1`.
