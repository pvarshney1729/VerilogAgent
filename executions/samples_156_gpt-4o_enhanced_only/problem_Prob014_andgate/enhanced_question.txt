Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: Single-bit input signal.
  - input wire b: Single-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: Single-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 2-input AND gate.
- The output `out` is the logical AND of the input signals `a` and `b`.

Signal Conventions:
- All signals are active-high, and each bit is considered independently as a single bit.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit for all ports, though in this module, each port is a single bit.

Timing and Logic:
- This is a purely combinational logic module with no internal state or clock dependencies.
- Changes in input values `a` and `b` are immediately reflected in the output `out` without any delay or clock cycle dependency.

Edge Case Behavior:
- For all possible input combinations of `a` and `b` (00, 01, 10, 11), the output `out` will correctly reflect the logical AND operation: 
  - `out = 1` if and only if `a = 1` and `b = 1`.
  - Otherwise, `out = 0`.
