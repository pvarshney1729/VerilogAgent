Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge\nof the clock. The reset input is active high synchronous, and should\nreset the counter to 1.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named TopModule, should be implemented with the following interface, where all input and output ports are one bit wide unless otherwise specified:\n\n- input  logic clk         // Clock signal input\n- input  logic reset       // Active high synchronous reset signal\n- output logic [3:0] q     // 4-bit output representing the count\n\nThe module will function as a decade counter, counting sequentially from 1 to 10 inclusive, and then wrapping back to 1. The following specifications apply:\n\n1. **Clock and Reset:**\n   - The counter logic should be triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n   - The `reset` input is synchronous and active high, meaning that reset actions occur on the positive edge of the clock when `reset` is high.\n   - When the reset is activated, the counter should reset to the value 1 on the next positive clock edge.\n\n2. **Counter Details:**\n   - The counter should increment its value on each positive edge of the clock.\n   - Once the counter reaches 10 (represented as 4'b1010), it should wrap around and reset to 1 on the next clock cycle.\n   - `q` is a 4-bit output where bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n3. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - Upon instantiation, or after an active reset, the counter should start at 1 (represented as 4'b0001).\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Ensure that the counter properly handles the transition from 10 back to 1 without skipping any values between 1 and 10.\n   - The implementation should handle the condition where `reset` is asserted during counting, ensuring the counter is properly reset to 1 in the following cycle.\n\n5. **Operation Precedence:**\n   - In the event that both increment and reset conditions occur simultaneously on the same clock edge, the reset condition should have precedence, ensuring the counter is set to 1.\n\nThis specification ensures a clear understanding of the module's behavior and its integration within a digital system.\n                    "
