<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named TopModule, should be implemented with the following interface, where all input and output ports are one bit wide unless otherwise specified:

- input  logic clk         // Clock signal input
- input  logic reset       // Active high synchronous reset signal
- output logic [3:0] q     // 4-bit output representing the count

The module will function as a decade counter, counting sequentially from 1 to 10 inclusive, and then wrapping back to 1. The following specifications apply:

1. **Clock and Reset:**
   - The counter logic should be triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).
   - The `reset` input is synchronous and active high, meaning that reset actions occur on the positive edge of the clock when `reset` is high.
   - When the reset is activated, the counter should reset to the value 1 on the next positive clock edge.

2. **Counter Details:**
   - The counter should increment its value on each positive edge of the clock.
   - Once the counter reaches 10 (represented as 4'b1010), it should wrap around and reset to 1 on the next clock cycle.
   - `q` is a 4-bit output where bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Upon instantiation, or after an active reset, the counter should start at 1 (represented as 4'b0001).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that the counter properly handles the transition from 10 back to 1 without skipping any values between 1 and 10.
   - The implementation should handle the condition where `reset` is asserted during counting, ensuring the counter is properly reset to 1 in the following cycle.

5. **Operation Precedence:**
   - In the event that both increment and reset conditions occur simultaneously on the same clock edge, the reset condition should have precedence, ensuring the counter is set to 1.

This specification ensures a clear understanding of the module's behavior and its integration within a digital system.
