Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [2:0] a`: A 3-bit unsigned input vector. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

- Output Ports:
  - `output [15:0] q`: A 16-bit unsigned output vector. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

Circuit Type:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.

Behavior Description:
- The module outputs a specific 16-bit value on `q` based on the 3-bit input `a` as follows:
  - When `a` is 3'b000, `q` is 16'h1232.
  - When `a` is 3'b001, `q` is 16'haee0.
  - When `a` is 3'b010, `q` is 16'h27d4.
  - When `a` is 3'b011, `q` is 16'h5a0e.
  - When `a` is 3'b100, `q` is 16'h2066.
  - When `a` is 3'b101, `q` is 16'h64ce.
  - When `a` is 3'b110, `q` is 16'hc526.
  - When `a` is 3'b111, `q` is 16'h2f19.

- The output `q` has no undefined or indeterminate state for any valid input `a` as the input range covers all possible 3-bit combinations.

Timing:
- The module is purely combinational and does not depend on clock cycles, resets, or initial states.

Edge Cases:
- All possible input values (0 to 7) are explicitly defined with corresponding output mappings.
- There are no race conditions as this is a combinational circuit.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure that all input and output values are treated as unsigned.
- The output mapping is direct and does not involve any sequential or state-based logic.
