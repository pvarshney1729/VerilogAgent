<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified. The module is designed to work with a 32-bit global history shift register, supporting rollback on a branch misprediction.

- `input  wire clk` : Clock signal, positive edge triggered.
- `input  wire areset` : Asynchronous reset signal, active high, which resets the history register to zero.
- `input  wire predict_valid` : Signal indicating a valid branch prediction is being made.
- `input  wire predict_taken` : Signal indicating the predicted branch direction (taken or not taken).
- `input  wire train_mispredicted` : Signal indicating a branch misprediction has occurred.
- `input  wire train_taken` : Signal indicating the actual direction of the branch that was mispredicted.
- `input  wire [31:0] train_history` : 32-bit history of branches before the mispredicted branch.
- `output reg [31:0] predict_history` : 32-bit output reflecting the current state of the branch history register.

Functional Details:

1. **Global History Shift Register**: 
   - The `predict_history` register maintains the global branch history. It is updated on the positive edge of the clock.

2. **Branch Prediction**:
   - When `predict_valid` is high, the `predict_taken` value is shifted into the least significant bit (LSB) of the `predict_history` register. The bit `predict_history[0]` represents the direction of the most recent (youngest) branch.

3. **Branch Misprediction**:
   - When `train_mispredicted` is high, the `predict_history` register is loaded with the `train_history` concatenated with the `train_taken` value. This operation restores the history to the state before the mispredicted branch, with the actual result of the branch appended as the new youngest branch.

4. **Precedence**:
   - If both a prediction (`predict_valid = 1`) and misprediction (`train_mispredicted = 1`) occur simultaneously, the misprediction takes precedence, as the pipeline flush will invalidate the branch currently being predicted.

5. **Asynchronous Reset**:
   - When `areset` is high, regardless of the clock, the `predict_history` register is reset to zero.

6. **Sequential Logic**:
   - All sequential logic in the module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

Edge Cases and Initial Conditions:
- Upon system start or reset (`areset` asserted), the `predict_history` register is initialized to zero.
- Ensure correct handling of simultaneous prediction and misprediction, with priority given to misprediction.
- Explicitly define all register initial states and behaviors under reset conditions to prevent undefined behavior.

The module must ensure correct operation under all specified scenarios, maintaining accurate branch history management through predictions and mispredictions.
