Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire b` : 1-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out_assign` : 1-bit output signal, representing the AND operation result using an assign statement.
  - `output wire out_alwaysblock` : 1-bit output signal, representing the AND operation result using a combinational always block.

Specifications:
1. The module `TopModule` performs an AND operation on two 1-bit input signals, `a` and `b`.

2. The output `out_assign` should be the result of the AND operation implemented using an `assign` statement. The logic expression is `out_assign = a & b;`.

3. The output `out_alwaysblock` should be the result of the AND operation implemented using a combinational `always` block. The block should be sensitive to changes in both inputs `a` and `b`, ensuring it updates `out_alwaysblock` whenever `a` or `b` changes.

4. All input and output signals are 1-bit wide, with `bit[0]` being the least significant bit.

5. Ensure that the always block is defined correctly for combinational logic (i.e., using `@(*)` sensitivity list).

6. No resets are involved as this is purely combinational logic with no sequential elements or state storage.

7. This module does not involve any clock signals as it only implements combinational logic.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Both outputs should correctly reflect the logical AND operation for all possible combinations of the inputs `a` and `b` (00, 01, 10, 11).
- Ensure consistent logical behavior for both outputs across all input scenarios.
