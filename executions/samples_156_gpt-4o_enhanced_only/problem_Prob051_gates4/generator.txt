Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` based on the provided specifications and guidelines.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [3:0] in,
    output logic out_and,
    output logic out_or,
    output logic out_xor
);

    // Combinational logic for the outputs
    assign out_and = &in;   // 4-input AND operation
    assign out_or  = |in;   // 4-input OR operation
    assign out_xor = ^in;   // 4-input XOR operation

endmodule
[DONE] 

This implementation makes use of Verilog's reduction operators:
- `&`: Reduction AND, which performs an AND operation across all bits of the input vector.
- `|`: Reduction OR, which performs an OR operation across all bits of the input vector.
- `^`: Reduction XOR, which performs an XOR operation across all bits of the input vector.

Each assign statement directly computes the respective logic operation on the 4-bit input vector `in`. The module adheres to the guidelines provided, using `logic` for port declarations and ensuring the combinational logic is correctly implemented using assign statements.
