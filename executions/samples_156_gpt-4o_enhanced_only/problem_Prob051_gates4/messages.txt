When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nThis specification defines a combinational logic module named `TopModule` with specified input and output ports. All ports are one bit unless otherwise specified. The module operates with a 4-bit input vector and produces three distinct outputs based on different logic operations.\n\n### Interface:\n- **Input Ports:**\n  - `in`: A 4-bit vector input. \n    - Bit Indexing: `in[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB), and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- **Output Ports:**\n  - `out_and`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 4-input AND operation on the input vector `in[3:0]`.\n  - `out_or`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 4-input OR operation on the input vector `in[3:0]`.\n  - `out_xor`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 4-input XOR operation on the input vector `in[3:0]`.\n\n### Functional Description:\n- The module implements a combinational circuit with the following logic:\n  1. **AND Operation (`out_and`):** Computes the logical AND of all four bits of the input vector `in[3:0]`. The output `out_and` is high (`1`) if and only if all bits of `in` are high (`1`).\n  2. **OR Operation (`out_or`):** Computes the logical OR of all four bits of the input vector `in[3:0]`. The output `out_or` is high (`1`) if at least one bit of `in` is high (`1`).\n  3. **XOR Operation (`out_xor`):** Computes the logical XOR of all four bits of the input vector `in[3:0]`. The output `out_xor` is high (`1`) if an odd number of bits in `in` are high (`1`).\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- This module is purely combinational; there are no clock inputs, flip-flops, or registers.\n- No reset signals are required as there are no sequential elements.\n- Ensure that the logic synthesis tool correctly infers the AND, OR, and XOR gates for optimal implementation.\n- The output state is purely dependent on the current input values and changes instantly as inputs change, assuming an ideal combinational logic scenario without propagation delays.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- Verify that the logic correctly handles all possible 16 binary combinations of the input vector `in[3:0]` ranging from `0000` to `1111`.\n- Ensure that the synthesized logic handles potential glitches due to input changes which could be an issue in practical scenarios but are idealized away in this specification.\n\nBy following this specification, the `TopModule` will correctly perform the defined logical operations.\n                    "
