Module Name: TopModule

Objective: Implement a module that behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using available FPGA resources.

Port Definitions:
- `input wire clk`: Clock signal. The module must respond to both rising and falling edges.
- `input wire d`: Data input, 1-bit.
- `output reg q`: Data output, 1-bit.

Specifications:
1. Clock Behavior:
   - This module should mimic the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, updating the output `q` on both rising and falling edges of `clk`.
   - Due to FPGA limitations, simulate dual-edge behavior using combinational logic and additional registers.

2. Internal Logic:
   - Use two single-edge triggered flip-flops to capture data on both edges.
   - For rising edge, capture data into an intermediate register `q_pos`:
     - `q_pos` is a 1-bit register initialized to 0 at reset.
   - For falling edge, capture data into another intermediate register `q_neg`:
     - `q_neg` is a 1-bit register initialized to 0 at reset.
   - Combine the outputs of `q_pos` and `q_neg` using combinational logic to produce the final output `q`.

3. Reset Behavior:
   - Implement an asynchronous reset input `reset_n` (active low) to initialize the registers.
   - On reset assertion, both `q_pos` and `q_neg` should be reset to 0, and consequently, `q` should also be 0.

4. Data Propagation and Edge Handling:
   - Ensure that any changes in `d` are correctly captured on the subsequent clock edge, whether rising or falling.
   - The design should avoid race conditions by ensuring proper timing and logic separation between capturing and combining operations.
   - Clearly document the precedence of operations if multiple signals change at once.

5. Edge Cases:
   - Confirm the stability of `q` when `clk` remains constant (no edge).
   - Define behavior when `d` changes at the same time as a clock edge, ensuring deterministic capture.

By following these guidelines, the design will faithfully emulate the desired dual-edge triggered flip-flop functionality while adhering to FPGA constraints.
