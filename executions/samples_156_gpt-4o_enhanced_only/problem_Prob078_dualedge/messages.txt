Build a circuit that functionally behaves like a\ndual-edge triggered flip-flop.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nObjective: Implement a module that behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using available FPGA resources.\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal. The module must respond to both rising and falling edges.\n- `input wire d`: Data input, 1-bit.\n- `output reg q`: Data output, 1-bit.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. Clock Behavior:\n   - This module should mimic the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, updating the output `q` on both rising and falling edges of `clk`.\n   - Due to FPGA limitations, simulate dual-edge behavior using combinational logic and additional registers.\n\n2. Internal Logic:\n   - Use two single-edge triggered flip-flops to capture data on both edges.\n   - For rising edge, capture data into an intermediate register `q_pos`:\n     - `q_pos` is a 1-bit register initialized to 0 at reset.\n   - For falling edge, capture data into another intermediate register `q_neg`:\n     - `q_neg` is a 1-bit register initialized to 0 at reset.\n   - Combine the outputs of `q_pos` and `q_neg` using combinational logic to produce the final output `q`.\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n   - Implement an asynchronous reset input `reset_n` (active low) to initialize the registers.\n   - On reset assertion, both `q_pos` and `q_neg` should be reset to 0, and consequently, `q` should also be 0.\n\n4. Data Propagation and Edge Handling:\n   - Ensure that any changes in `d` are correctly captured on the subsequent clock edge, whether rising or falling.\n   - The design should avoid race conditions by ensuring proper timing and logic separation between capturing and combining operations.\n   - Clearly document the precedence of operations if multiple signals change at once.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n   - Confirm the stability of `q` when `clk` remains constant (no edge).\n   - Define behavior when `d` changes at the same time as a clock edge, ensuring deterministic capture.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the design will faithfully emulate the desired dual-edge triggered flip-flop functionality while adhering to FPGA constraints.\n                    "
