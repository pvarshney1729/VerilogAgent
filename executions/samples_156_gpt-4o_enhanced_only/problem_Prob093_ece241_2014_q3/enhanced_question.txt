Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - input wire c (1 bit): Represents a single-bit input signal.
  - input wire d (1 bit): Represents a single-bit input signal.
- Outputs:
  - output wire [3:0] mux_in: Represents a 4-bit output vector. Each bit of this vector is connected to the corresponding input of a 4-to-1 multiplexer using {a, b} as the selector.

Specifications:
- The TopModule takes two 1-bit inputs, 'c' and 'd', and outputs a 4-bit vector 'mux_in' that aligns with the specified Karnaugh map using a combination of 4-to-1 and 2-to-1 multiplexers.
- The 4-to-1 multiplexer uses 'a' and 'b' as the select lines, where:
  - mux_in[0] corresponds to selector {a, b} = 00
  - mux_in[1] corresponds to selector {a, b} = 01
  - mux_in[2] corresponds to selector {a, b} = 11
  - mux_in[3] corresponds to selector {a, b} = 10

Karnaugh Map Definition:
- The Karnaugh map provides the desired output for the inputs 'c' and 'd' based on the values of 'a' and 'b':

      ab
  cd  00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Implementation Guidelines:
- Use one 4-to-1 multiplexer as the primary element to select between the outputs based on {a, b}.
- Use as few 2-to-1 multiplexers as possible to derive the 'mux_in' values corresponding to each combination of inputs 'c' and 'd'.
- No additional logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) are allowed in the implementation.
- The implementation must strictly adhere to the Karnaugh map, ensuring correct mapping from inputs 'c', 'd' to 'mux_in'.

Note:
- All bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.
- Ensure that the implementation is synchronous, and any potential race conditions are avoided by correct use of multiplexer logic.
- There are no reset conditions or sequential elements defined in this specification.
