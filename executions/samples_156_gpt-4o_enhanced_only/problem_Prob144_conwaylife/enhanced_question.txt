Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- **Inputs:**
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.
  - `input load`: Active high, synchronous load signal for loading initial state into `q`.
  - `input [255:0] data`: 256-bit input vector representing the initial state of the 16x16 grid.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output reg [255:0] q`: 256-bit output vector representing the current state of the 16x16 grid.

Grid Details:
- The game operates on a 16x16 toroidal grid, meaning the edges wrap around.
- Each cell can be either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).
- The grid state is stored in the `q` vector, where:
  - `q[15:0]` corresponds to row 0,
  - `q[31:16]` corresponds to row 1,
  - ...
  - `q[255:240]` corresponds to row 15.

Cell Neighbor Rules:
- Each cell's future state depends on its current state and the number of its 8 neighbors:
  1. 0-1 neighbor: Cell becomes 0 (dead).
  2. 2 neighbors: Cell state remains unchanged.
  3. 3 neighbors: Cell becomes 1 (alive).
  4. 4 or more neighbors: Cell becomes 0 (dead).

Reset and Initial State:
- There is no explicit reset signal. The initial state is loaded when `load` is high on the positive edge of the clock.

Clock and Timing:
- The game state advances by one timestep every positive clock edge.
- When `load` is active high, the state `q` is updated with `data` on the next clock edge.
- If `load` is not active, the state `q` is updated according to the game rules on each positive clock edge.

Bit and Indexing Conventions:
- Bit[0] of the vector refers to the least significant bit.
- The indexing for the grid is row-major, meaning each continuous block of 16 bits in `q` represents a row.

Edge Cases:
- The grid is treated as toroidal; hence any access outside the bounds of 0 to 15 for row or column indices wraps around to the other side of the grid.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential elements update on the positive edge of the clock.

Dependencies:
- The state of each cell in `q` depends on its 8 neighbors. Ensure no race conditions by evaluating neighbor states before updating the grid.
