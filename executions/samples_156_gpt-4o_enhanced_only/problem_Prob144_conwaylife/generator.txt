Let's implement the `TopModule` using the provided specifications and guidelines. We'll create a 16x16 grid where each cell's state is updated based on its neighbors according to the rules of the game. The grid is toroidal, so the edges wrap around. We'll handle the grid as a 256-bit vector for both input and output.

Here's the Verilog code for the module:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic load,
    input logic [255:0] data,
    output logic [255:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the current state of the grid
    logic [255:0] next_q;

    // Function to calculate the number of alive neighbors for a given cell
    function automatic logic [3:0] count_neighbors(
        input logic [15:0] row [0:15],
        input int r, c
    );
        count_neighbors = row[(r + 15) % 16][(c + 15) % 16] + row[(r + 15) % 16][c] + row[(r + 15) % 16][(c + 1) % 16] +
                          row[r][(c + 15) % 16] + /* Skip the center cell itself */ row[r][(c + 1) % 16] +
                          row[(r + 1) % 16][(c + 15) % 16] + row[(r + 1) % 16][c] + row[(r + 1) % 16][(c + 1) % 16];
    endfunction

    // Sequential logic to update the grid state
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the initial state from data
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Calculate the next state of the grid
            logic [15:0] grid [0:15];
            for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) begin
                grid[i] = q[(i + 1) * 16 - 1:i * 16];
            end

            for (int r = 0; r < 16; r++) begin
                for (int c = 0; c < 16; c++) begin
                    int count = count_neighbors(grid, r, c);
                    logic current_state = grid[r][c];
                    logic next_state;
                    case (count)
                        2: next_state = current_state; // State does not change
                        3: next_state = 1; // Becomes alive
                        default: next_state = 0; // Becomes dead
                    endcase
                    next_q[r * 16 + c] = next_state;
                end
            end
            q <= next_q;
        end
    end

endmodule

### Explanation:
- **Grid Representation:** The grid is represented as a 16x16 array of bits. Each cell's neighbors are calculated considering the toroidal nature of the grid.
- **Count Neighbors:** A function `count_neighbors` calculates the number of alive neighbors for each cell, accounting for the wrapping edges.
- **State Update:** The module checks if the `load` signal is high to determine if it should load the initial state or advance the game state. The grid state is updated based on the neighbor count using the rules provided.
- **Sequential Logic:** The grid is updated on the positive edge of the clock. The `q` register holds the current state of the grid.
