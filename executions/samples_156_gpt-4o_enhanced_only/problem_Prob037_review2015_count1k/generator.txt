Based on the detailed specification and your requirements, here is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [9:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the counter value
    logic [9:0] counter;

    // Sequential logic for counter operation
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            counter <= 10'b0; // Reset the counter to 0 when reset is high
        end else begin
            if (counter == 10'd999) begin
                counter <= 10'b0; // Wrap around to 0 after reaching 999
            end else begin
                counter <= counter + 1; // Increment the counter
            end
        end
    end

    // Assign the internal counter value to the output
    assign q = counter;

endmodule

### Explanation:
- **Ports and Signals**: The module has one clock input (`clk`), one synchronous reset input (`reset`), and a 10-bit output (`q`). The internal counter is also a 10-bit signal.
- **Sequential Logic**: The `always_ff` block triggers on the rising edge of the clock. If `reset` is high, the counter is reset to 0. If the counter reaches 999, it wraps around to 0. Otherwise, it increments by 1.
- **Output Assignment**: The value of the counter is continuously assigned to the output `q`.
- **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is synchronous, ensuring that the counter is reset in sync with the clock signal.
