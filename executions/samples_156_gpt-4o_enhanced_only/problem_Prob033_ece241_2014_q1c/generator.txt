Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` as per your requirements. This module performs the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and checks for signed overflow.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [7:0] a,
    input  logic [7:0] b,
    output logic [7:0] s,
    output logic overflow
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Perform the addition
        s = a + b;
        
        // Check for signed overflow
        // Overflow occurs if:
        // - MSB of a and b are the same and different from the MSB of the result s
        overflow = (a[7] == b[7]) && (s[7] != a[7]);
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

In this implementation:
- The addition of the inputs `a` and `b` is performed, and the result is assigned to `s`.
- Signed overflow is detected by checking if the MSB of the inputs `a` and `b` are the same and differ from the MSB of the result `s`. This is done using the expression `(a[7] == b[7]) && (s[7] != a[7])`, which sets the `overflow` flag accordingly.
- The module uses only combinational logic as specified.
