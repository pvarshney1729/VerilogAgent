Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: 
  - a: 8-bit signed input. Bit indexing: a[7] is the most significant bit (MSB), a[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - b: 8-bit signed input. Bit indexing: b[7] is the MSB, b[0] is the LSB.
- Output:
  - s: 8-bit signed output. Bit indexing: s[7] is the MSB, s[0] is the LSB.
  - overflow: 1-bit output, indicates whether a signed overflow has occurred.

Functional Description:
- The module performs the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a and b.
- The result of the addition is stored in s[7:0].
- Overflow detection: The overflow output should be set to '1' if a signed overflow occurs. Signed overflow occurs if:
  - Both a[7] and b[7] are '0', and s[7] is '1' (positive overflow).
  - Both a[7] and b[7] are '1', and s[7] is '0' (negative overflow).
- In all other cases, the overflow output should be '0'.

Additional Notes:
- The module is entirely combinational and does not include any registers or clock inputs.
- The behavior of the module is purely based on the current values of inputs a and b.
- Ensure all calculations respect 2's complement arithmetic rules.
- No initial values or reset conditions are required as the design does not include any sequential logic elements.
