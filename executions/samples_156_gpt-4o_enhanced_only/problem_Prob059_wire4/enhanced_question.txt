<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Inputs:
  - `input a`: 1-bit, unsigned. Represents a control signal connected to the output `w`.
  - `input b`: 1-bit, unsigned. Represents a control signal connected to the outputs `x` and `y`.
  - `input c`: 1-bit, unsigned. Represents a control signal connected to the output `z`.

- Outputs:
  - `output w`: 1-bit, unsigned. Directly driven by input `a`.
  - `output x`: 1-bit, unsigned. Directly driven by input `b`.
  - `output y`: 1-bit, unsigned. Directly driven by input `b`.
  - `output z`: 1-bit, unsigned. Directly driven by input `c`.

Connection Behavior:
- This module is purely combinational and has no internal state or memory elements.
- The inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` are directly wired to outputs `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` as specified:
  - `a` is directly connected to `w`.
  - `b` is directly connected to both `x` and `y`.
  - `c` is directly connected to `z`.

Additional Notes:
- All signals are combinationally connected; there are no sequential elements, clocking, or reset mechanisms involved.
- The module operates purely on the basis of the input signals' current values, with no dependency on previous states or clock edges.
- This implementation assumes ideal conditions with no propagation delay or race conditions as it represents direct wire connections.
