Module Name: TopModule

Port Descriptions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal. The circuit is triggered on the positive edge.
- input wire a: 1-bit input signal.
- input wire b: 1-bit input signal.
- output reg q: 1-bit output signal.
- output reg state: 1-bit output signal representing the state of the flip-flop.

Circuit Description:
- This module implements a sequential circuit consisting of combinational logic and one bit of memory, realized through a single flip-flop.
- The flip-flop's output is directly observable through the 'state' output.
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock ('clk').

Initial Conditions:
- The initial state of the flip-flop (output 'state') is low (0).
- The initial output q is unspecified until after the first clock edge.

Behavior and Logic Description:
- The output 'q' and the flip-flop 'state' are updated at each positive clock edge based on the current inputs 'a' and 'b' and the previous state of the flip-flop.
- The circuit behavior can be extracted from the given waveform data as follows:
  - If both inputs 'a' and 'b' are high (1), the output 'q' toggles its current state.
  - If 'a' is high (1) and 'b' is low (0), the output 'q' remains unchanged.
  - If 'a' is low (0) and 'b' is high (1), the output 'q' is set to the inverse of the current state.
  - If both inputs 'a' and 'b' are low (0), the output 'q' is set to the current state.

Reset Behavior:
- No explicit reset signal is defined. The flip-flop initializes to a low state (0) by default at simulation start.

Bit Indexing:
- The circuit utilizes single-bit signals; therefore, no bit indexing is necessary.

Edge Case Considerations:
- The input combinations and the corresponding logic have been derived from the waveform data. Ensure inputs 'a' and 'b' do not remain undefined ('x') during simulation to prevent indeterminate states.
