Based on the provided waveform data and the derived behavior, I'll implement the `TopModule` as a sequential circuit with the specified logic. Let's proceed with the Verilog code implementation:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic q,
    output logic state
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        // Flip-flop logic to update the state
        state <= (a & b) ? ~state : ((a & ~b) ? state : (~a & b) ? ~state : state);
        
        // Output logic based on the state and inputs
        q <= (a & b) ? ~state : ((a & ~b) ? state : (~a & b) ? ~state : state);
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation
- **State Update Logic**: The flip-flop state is toggled when both `a` and `b` are high. If only `a` is high, the state remains unchanged. If only `b` is high, the state is set to the inverse of the current state.
- **Output Logic (`q`)**: The output `q` mimics the behavior of the state, following the same logic derived from the waveform data.
- **Sensitivity List**: The `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the logic is evaluated at the positive edge of the clock signal.
- **Initialization**: In simulation, flip-flops are initialized to zero, as per typical Verilog simulation behavior. No explicit reset is implemented based on the provided instructions.

This implementation should satisfy the requirements and correctly simulate the observed behavior from the waveform data.
