All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nThe module should assign the output port to the same value as the input\nport combinationally.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input:\n  - `input wire in` : A single-bit input signal. Bit indexing is not applicable as this is a scalar signal.\n- Output:\n  - `output wire out` : A single-bit output signal. This signal is combinationally driven by the input signal `in`.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module `TopModule` is a purely combinational logic block. The value on the output port `out` is directly assigned to the value of the input port `in` without any delay or modification.\n- The relationship between `in` and `out` is expressed as: `out = in`.\n- There are no clock signals or sequential elements involved in this module, ensuring there are no synchronous or asynchronous resets required.\n- As this is a purely combinational logic, there are no initial values or states needed for the ports.\n- There are no dependencies or operations precedence issues involved, as the output simply mirrors the input.\n- The module operates correctly for all possible values of the input (`in = 0` or `in = 1`).\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Since the input is a single bit, the only edge cases are `0` and `1`, and both are inherently managed by the direct assignment.\n\nNotes:\n- Ensure that any connecting logic or modules that interface with `TopModule` respect the single-bit width of both the input and output ports.\n                    "
