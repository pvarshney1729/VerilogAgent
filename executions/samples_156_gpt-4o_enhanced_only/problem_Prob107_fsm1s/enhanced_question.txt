Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: 
  - clk: 1-bit clock input signal.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
  - in: 1-bit input signal.
- Output:
  - out: 1-bit output signal.

State Machine Description:
- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: State A and State B.
- The state transitions depend on the input signal 'in', as follows:
  - From State B (out=1):
    - If in=0, transition to State A.
    - If in=1, remain in State B.
  - From State A (out=0):
    - If in=0, transition to State B.
    - If in=1, remain in State A.
- The output 'out' is associated with the state:
  - State B: out = 1
  - State A: out = 0

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high. 
- Upon the activation of the reset signal, the state machine transitions to State B, regardless of current state or input.

Initial Conditions:
- On reset (synchronous), the initial state is State B, and the output 'out' is set to 1.
- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'.
- The module assumes that input signals are stable at the clock edge.

Signal and Operation Details:
- Bit Indexing: Single-bit signals do not require explicit indexing.
- The transition logic is evaluated on the rising edge of the clock, ensuring no race conditions as transitions are based on stable inputs.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- The module is designed to function correctly when the reset signal is held high for multiple clock cycles, ensuring a stable initial state.
- The behavior is well-defined for all possible input scenarios at each state transition.
