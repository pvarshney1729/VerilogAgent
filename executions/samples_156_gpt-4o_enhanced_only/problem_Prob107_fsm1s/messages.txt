All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nImplement the following Moore state machine with two states, one input,\nand one output. The reset state is B and reset is active-high\nsynchronous.\n\n  B (out=1) --in=0--> A\n  B (out=1) --in=1--> B\n  A (out=0) --in=0--> B\n  A (out=0) --in=1--> A\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: \n  - clk: 1-bit clock input signal.\n  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n  - in: 1-bit input signal.\n- Output:\n  - out: 1-bit output signal.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: State A and State B.\n- The state transitions depend on the input signal 'in', as follows:\n  - From State B (out=1):\n    - If in=0, transition to State A.\n    - If in=1, remain in State B.\n  - From State A (out=0):\n    - If in=0, transition to State B.\n    - If in=1, remain in State A.\n- The output 'out' is associated with the state:\n  - State B: out = 1\n  - State A: out = 0\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high. \n- Upon the activation of the reset signal, the state machine transitions to State B, regardless of current state or input.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On reset (synchronous), the initial state is State B, and the output 'out' is set to 1.\n- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'.\n- The module assumes that input signals are stable at the clock edge.\n\nSignal and Operation Details:\n- Bit Indexing: Single-bit signals do not require explicit indexing.\n- The transition logic is evaluated on the rising edge of the clock, ensuring no race conditions as transitions are based on stable inputs.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- The module is designed to function correctly when the reset signal is held high for multiple clock cycles, ensuring a stable initial state.\n- The behavior is well-defined for all possible input scenarios at each state transition.\n                    "
