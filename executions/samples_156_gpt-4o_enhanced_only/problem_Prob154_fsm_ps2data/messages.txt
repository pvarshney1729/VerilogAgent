All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  in (8 bits)\n - output out_bytes (24 bits)\n - output done\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine that will search for\nmessage boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll\nuse is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume\nthat this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message\nonce all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in\nthe cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was\nsuccessfully received.\n\nImplement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte)\nmessage whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first\nbyte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is\nactive high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done\nsignal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e.,\ndon't-care). Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive\nedge of the clock.\n\nHere is an example waveform:\n\n  time   clk rst in  done out_bytes\n  0ns    0   1    0  x         x\n  5ns    1   1    0  0         x\n  10ns   0   1    0  0         x\n  15ns   1   0   2c  0         x\n  20ns   0   0   2c  0         x\n  25ns   1   0   81  0         x\n  30ns   0   0   81  0         x\n  35ns   1   0    9  0         x\n  40ns   0   0    9  0         x\n  45ns   1   0   6b  1    2c8109\n  50ns   0   0   6b  1    2c8109\n  55ns   1   0    d  0         x\n  60ns   0   0    d  0         x\n  65ns   1   0   8d  0         x\n  70ns   0   0   8d  0         x\n  75ns   1   0   6d  1    6b0d8d\n  80ns   0   0   6d  1    6b0d8d\n  85ns   1   0   12  0         x\n  90ns   0   0   12  0         x\n  95ns   1   0    1  0         x\n  100ns  0   0    1  0         x\n  105ns  1   0    d  1    6d1201\n  110ns  0   0    d  1    6d1201\n  115ns  1   0   76  0         x\n  120ns  0   0   76  0         x\n  125ns  1   0   3d  0         x\n  130ns  0   0   3d  0         x\n  135ns  1   0   ed  1     d763d\n  140ns  0   0   ed  1     d763d\n  145ns  1   0   8c  0         x\n  150ns  0   0   8c  0         x\n  155ns  1   0   f9  0         x\n  160ns  0   0   f9  0         x\n  165ns  1   0   ce  1    ed8cf9\n  170ns  0   0   ce  1    ed8cf9\n  175ns  1   0   c5  0         x\n  180ns  0   0   c5  0         x\n  185ns  1   0   aa  0         x\n  190ns  0   0   aa  0         x\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface specifications. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.\n\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for the module; all sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire reset`: Active high synchronous reset signal; when asserted, all state and output registers should reset to their initial states.\n  - `input wire [7:0] in`: 8-bit input data stream where `in[0]` refers to the least significant bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [23:0] out_bytes`: 24-bit output representing the received message; `out_bytes[23:16]` is the first byte, `out_bytes[15:8]` is the second byte, and `out_bytes[7:0]` is the third byte.\n  - `output reg done`: Signal asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte of a message is received.\n\nThe module's functionality involves a finite state machine (FSM) designed to detect message boundaries within a stream of input bytes. The FSM operates as follows:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The FSM remains in this state until it detects a byte with `in[3] = 1`. This byte marks the start of a new message.\n   \n2. **Message Reception**: Once a start byte is detected, the FSM transitions to a state where it expects the next two bytes to complete the three-byte message.\n\n3. **Completion**: After receiving the third byte, the FSM asserts the `done` signal in the subsequent clock cycle, indicating that a full message has been received. The `out_bytes` will hold the valid three-byte message in the order of reception.\n\n4. **Reset Behavior**: When the `reset` signal is asserted, the FSM returns to its initial state, and `out_bytes` and `done` are reset. The initial value for `out_bytes` is don't-care, and `done` should be set to 0.\n\n**Additional Considerations**:\n- The FSM should handle all byte transitions on the positive edge of the clock.\n- The reset operation is synchronous, meaning it only takes effect on the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.\n- Ensure no race conditions by explicitly managing state transitions relative to clock edges.\n- It is acceptable for `out_bytes` to contain undefined values when `done` is not asserted, as these outputs are don't-care in such states.\n\nThis specification ensures that the module correctly implements the intended functionality with clear and precise behavior definitions across all operating conditions.\n                    "
