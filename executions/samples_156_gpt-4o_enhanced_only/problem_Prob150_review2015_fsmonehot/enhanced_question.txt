**Port Definitions:**
- Inputs:
  - `input wire d` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire done_counting` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire ack` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [9:0] state` : 10-bit input signal representing the current state in one-hot encoding.
- Outputs:
  - `output wire B3_next` : 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is B3.
  - `output wire S_next` : 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is S.
  - `output wire S1_next` : 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is S1.
  - `output wire Count_next` : 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is Count.
  - `output wire Wait_next` : 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is Wait.
  - `output wire done` : 1-bit output, active when the state is Wait and ack is 0.
  - `output wire counting` : 1-bit output, active when the state is Count.
  - `output wire shift_ena` : 1-bit output, active during states B0, B1, B2, and B3.

**State Encoding:**
- States are encoded using one-hot encoding:
  - S = 10'b0000000001
  - S1 = 10'b0000000010
  - S11 = 10'b0000000100
  - S110 = 10'b0000001000
  - B0 = 10'b0000010000
  - B1 = 10'b0000100000
  - B2 = 10'b0001000000
  - B3 = 10'b0010000000
  - Count = 10'b0100000000
  - Wait = 10'b1000000000

**Reset Behavior:**
- At reset, the state machine initializes to state "S".

**State Transitions:**
- From state S:
  - If `d == 0`, remain in state S.
  - If `d == 1`, transition to state S1.
- From state S1:
  - If `d == 0`, transition to state S.
  - If `d == 1`, transition to state S11.
- From state S11:
  - If `d == 0`, transition to state S110.
  - If `d == 1`, remain in state S11.
- From state S110:
  - If `d == 0`, transition to state S.
  - If `d == 1`, transition to state B0.
- From state B0:
  - Always transition to state B1.
- From state B1:
  - Always transition to state B2.
- From state B2:
  - Always transition to state B3.
- From state B3:
  - Always transition to state Count.
- From state Count:
  - If `done_counting == 0`, remain in state Count.
  - If `done_counting == 1`, transition to state Wait.
- From state Wait:
  - If `ack == 0`, remain in state Wait.
  - If `ack == 1`, transition to state S.

**Output Logic Equations:**
- `B3_next`: Assert when the next state is B3.
- `S_next`: Assert when the next state is S.
- `S1_next`: Assert when the next state is S1.
- `Count_next`: Assert when the next state is Count.
- `Wait_next`: Assert when the next state is Wait.
- `done`: Assert when the current state is Wait.
- `counting`: Assert when the current state is Count.
- `shift_ena`: Assert when the current state is any of B0, B1, B2, or B3.
