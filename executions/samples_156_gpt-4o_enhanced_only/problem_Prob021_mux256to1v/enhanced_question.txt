Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire [1023:0] in` : A 1024-bit input vector representing 256 concatenated 4-bit inputs. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit of the first 4-bit input.
  - `input wire [7:0] sel` : An 8-bit selection input to choose one of the 256 4-bit sections from the `in` vector.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire [3:0] out` : A 4-bit output representing the selected 4-bit input section.

Functional Description:
- The module functions as a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.
- The input selection (`sel`) determines which 4-bit section of the `in` vector is routed to the `out` port.
- For any value of `sel` ranging from 0 to 255, the selected 4-bit segment is calculated as follows:
  - For sel = N, where N is a value between 0 and 255, the output `out` will be `in[4*N+3 : 4*N]`.
  - Specifically:
    - `sel = 0` selects `in[3:0]`
    - `sel = 1` selects `in[7:4]`
    - `sel = 2` selects `in[11:8]`
    - ...
    - `sel = 255` selects `in[1023:1020]`

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The `sel` input must remain within the 0 to 255 range to ensure valid operation. Any value outside this range is undefined but will not be encountered under normal operation within specified constraints.
- This module implements combinational logic; thus, there are no clock cycle dependencies or reset logic involved.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that bit indexing starts from 0 where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit of the `in` vector.
- The module should be purely combinational, with no internal state or sequential elements.
