All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in  (1024 bits)\n - input  sel (   8 bits)\n - output out (   4 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. The 256\n4-bit inputs are all packed into a single 1024-bit input vector. sel=0\nshould select bits in[3:0], sel=1 selects bits in[7:4], sel=2 selects\nbits in[11:8], etc.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire [1023:0] in` : A 1024-bit input vector representing 256 concatenated 4-bit inputs. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit of the first 4-bit input.\n  - `input wire [7:0] sel` : An 8-bit selection input to choose one of the 256 4-bit sections from the `in` vector.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire [3:0] out` : A 4-bit output representing the selected 4-bit input section.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module functions as a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.\n- The input selection (`sel`) determines which 4-bit section of the `in` vector is routed to the `out` port.\n- For any value of `sel` ranging from 0 to 255, the selected 4-bit segment is calculated as follows:\n  - For sel = N, where N is a value between 0 and 255, the output `out` will be `in[4*N+3 : 4*N]`.\n  - Specifically:\n    - `sel = 0` selects `in[3:0]`\n    - `sel = 1` selects `in[7:4]`\n    - `sel = 2` selects `in[11:8]`\n    - ...\n    - `sel = 255` selects `in[1023:1020]`\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The `sel` input must remain within the 0 to 255 range to ensure valid operation. Any value outside this range is undefined but will not be encountered under normal operation within specified constraints.\n- This module implements combinational logic; thus, there are no clock cycle dependencies or reset logic involved.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that bit indexing starts from 0 where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit of the `in` vector.\n- The module should be purely combinational, with no internal state or sequential elements.\n                    "
