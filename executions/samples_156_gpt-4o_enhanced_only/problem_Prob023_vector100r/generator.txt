Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` which reverses the bit order of the 100-bit input and outputs it.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [99:0] in,
    output logic [99:0] out
);
    // Combinational logic to reverse the bit order of the input
    always @(*) begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) begin
            out[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    end
endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses a combinational `always` block to iterate over each bit of the `in` vector, reversing the order and assigning it to the `out` vector. The use of `always @(*)` ensures that the logic is evaluated whenever any input signal changes. This approach adheres to the guidelines and conventions provided.
