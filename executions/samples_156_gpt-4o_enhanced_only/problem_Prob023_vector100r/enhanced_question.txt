<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `in`: A 100-bit wide input vector. The most significant bit (MSB) is `in[99]`, and the least significant bit (LSB) is `in[0]`.
- Outputs:
  - `out`: A 100-bit wide output vector. The MSB is `out[99]`, and the LSB is `out[0]`.

Functionality:
- The module shall reverse the order of the bits in the input vector `in` and assign the reversed bit order to the output vector `out`.
- Specifically, `out[i]` shall be assigned the value of `in[99-i]` for each bit index `i` ranging from 0 to 99.

Behavior:
- This operation is purely combinational with no dependency on any clock or reset signals.
- All bits in the input and output vectors are unsigned.

Edge Cases:
- The module must handle all possible 100-bit input combinations correctly, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the reversed bit order of the input.

Note:
- Ensure that the design handles propagation delays appropriately to maintain correct functionality and timing, particularly in longer data paths due to the large width of the input and output vectors.
