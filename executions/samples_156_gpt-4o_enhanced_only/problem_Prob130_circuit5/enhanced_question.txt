Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [3:0] a`: 4-bit wide input vector.
  - `input [3:0] b`: 4-bit wide input vector.
  - `input [3:0] c`: 4-bit wide input vector.
  - `input [3:0] d`: 4-bit wide input vector.
  - `input [3:0] e`: 4-bit wide input vector.

- Output Port:
  - `output [3:0] q`: 4-bit wide output vector.

Bit Indexing Convention:
- All vectors are indexed from MSB to LSB, with bit[3] as the most significant bit and bit[0] as the least significant bit.

Module Functionality:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit. There are no sequential elements or state-holding components.
- The output `q` is determined based on the value of the input `c` as follows:
  - If `c == 4'd0`, then `q = b`.
  - If `c == 4'd1`, then `q = e`.
  - If `c == 4'd2`, then `q = a`.
  - If `c == 4'd3`, then `q = d`.
  - For `c` values from `4'd4` to `4'd15`, `q = 4'b1111` (binary representation of decimal 15).

Operational Precedence:
- The selection of `q` is solely dependent on the value of input `c`. Inputs `a`, `b`, `d`, and `e` are used based on the matching condition of `c`.

Edge Cases:
- When `c` is greater than or equal to `4'd4`, the output `q` defaults to `4'b1111`.

Assumptions:
- All input signals are assumed to be stable during the evaluation of the combinational logic.
- The input and output delays are not specified and are assumed to be ideal (zero delay) for the purpose of this specification.

This specification is intended to guide the correct implementation of the TopModule in Verilog.
