Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [3:0] x`: A 4-bit unsigned input vector. Bit indexing follows the convention where `x[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `x[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB).
- Output Ports:
  - `output f`: A single-bit output representing the result of the function defined by the Karnaugh map.

Functional Specification:
- The module computes the output `f` based on the 4-bit input vector `x` using a combinational logic function defined by the following Karnaugh map:

             x[0]x[1]
  x[2]x[3]  00  01  11  10
    00     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
    01     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    11     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
    10     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

- The Karnaugh map should be interpreted as follows:
  - Each cell in the map corresponds to a specific combination of `x[3:0]`.
  - The rows represent the values of `x[2:3]` in binary order, and the columns represent `x[0:1]`.
  - The value within each cell (either 0 or 1) indicates the output `f` for that specific combination of input values.

Additional Notes:
- This specification assumes combinational logic, meaning the output `f` is directly computed from the current value of `x` without any clock or reset dependencies.
- There are no sequential elements or state dependencies within this module.
- The output `f` is updated instantaneously with any change in the input `x`, reflecting the nature of combinational logic.
- The behavior for all possible input values of `x` (from 4'b0000 to 4'b1111) is explicitly defined by the Karnaugh map.
