Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic areset,
    input logic load,
    input logic ena,
    input logic [3:0] data,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            if (load) begin
                q <= data;
            end else if (ena) begin
                q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]};
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

Explanation:
- We use `always_ff` to describe sequential logic, which is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset.
- When the `areset` signal is high, `q` is immediately reset to `4'b0000`.
- If `areset` is not asserted and the `clk` edge occurs:
  - If `load` is asserted, `q` is loaded with the value from `data`.
  - If `load` is not asserted but `ena` is, a right shift operation occurs, with `q[3]` being set to `0` and the rest of the bits shifting right.
- The `load` operation has higher priority over the `ena` operation as specified.
