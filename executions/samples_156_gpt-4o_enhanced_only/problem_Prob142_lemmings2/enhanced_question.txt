Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Inputs:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal; all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - areset: 1-bit asynchronous reset signal; active high, resets the state machine to walk left.
  - bump_left: 1-bit signal; indicates a bump on the left side.
  - bump_right: 1-bit signal; indicates a bump on the right side.
  - ground: 1-bit signal; indicates whether the ground is present (1) or absent (0).

- Outputs:
  - walk_left: 1-bit output; high when the Lemming is walking left.
  - walk_right: 1-bit output; high when the Lemming is walking right.
  - aaah: 1-bit output; high when the Lemming is falling.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- The FSM is a Moore machine with the following states:
  1. WALK_LEFT: Lemming walks left.
  2. WALK_RIGHT: Lemming walks right.
  3. FALL_LEFT: Lemming is falling, was last walking left.
  4. FALL_RIGHT: Lemming is falling, was last walking right.

- State Transition Logic:
  - From WALK_LEFT:
    - Transitions to WALK_RIGHT if bump_left = 1.
    - Transitions to FALL_LEFT if ground = 0.
  - From WALK_RIGHT:
    - Transitions to WALK_LEFT if bump_right = 1.
    - Transitions to FALL_RIGHT if ground = 0.
  - From FALL_LEFT:
    - Transitions to WALK_LEFT if ground = 1.
  - From FALL_RIGHT:
    - Transitions to WALK_RIGHT if ground = 1.

- Signal Definitions:
  - walk_left = 1 when in state WALK_LEFT.
  - walk_right = 1 when in state WALK_RIGHT.
  - aaah = 1 when in states FALL_LEFT or FALL_RIGHT.

- Reset Behavior:
  - On areset = 1, the FSM asynchronously resets to the WALK_LEFT state, regardless of the clock edge.

- Edge Case Handling:
  - If bump_left and bump_right are both 1 simultaneously, the Lemming switches direction.
  - Bumps during falling (states FALL_LEFT or FALL_RIGHT) do not affect walking direction.
  - A bump coinciding with ground = 0 does not affect the current walking direction after falling.
  - When transitioning back to walking from a fall (ground transitions from 0 to 1), the Lemming resumes walking in the last known direction.

- Bit Indexing:
  - All signals are treated as single-bit, hence no specific bit indexing is required.
  - All operations involving signal assignments are based on the current state and input conditions.

- Initial Values:
  - On power-up and reset, the FSM starts in the WALK_LEFT state, with walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0, and aaah = 0.

This specification is designed to ensure a clear, concise, and correct implementation of the Lemming's behavior as described.
