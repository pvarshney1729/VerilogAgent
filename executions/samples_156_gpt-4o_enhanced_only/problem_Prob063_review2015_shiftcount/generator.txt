Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` based on the provided specifications.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic shift_ena,
    input logic count_ena,
    input logic data,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (shift_ena) begin
            // Shift operation: shift in data into MSB
            q <= {data, q[3:1]};
        end else if (count_ena) begin
            // Count operation: decrement the current value
            q <= q - 1;
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Ports Declaration**: The module uses `logic` for all inputs and the output, following modern Verilog conventions.
- **Sequential Logic**: The `always_ff` block is used to infer flip-flops, which operate on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- **Shift Operation**: When `shift_ena` is high, the `data` bit is shifted into the most significant bit of `q`, and all other bits are shifted right.
- **Decrement Operation**: When `count_ena` is high, the current value of `q` is decremented by 1.
- **Priority**: The operations are mutually exclusive by design, so there's no need to define priority between them. The implementation handles each case separately.

This implementation meets the requirements and adheres to the coding conventions provided.
