Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: 1-bit, unsigned
  - input wire b: 1-bit, unsigned

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: 1-bit, unsigned

Specification:
- This module implements a combinational logic NOR gate.
- The output 'out' is the logical NOR of the inputs 'a' and 'b'.
- The logical NOR operation is defined as: out = ~(a | b).
- As this is a combinational logic circuit, there are no clock or reset signals involved.
- The output 'out' will be high (1) when both inputs 'a' and 'b' are low (0).
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are 1-bit wide.
- Ensure no race conditions exist as the module does not have sequential elements.
- Behavior at edge cases: Since this is a simple NOR gate, the only edge cases are the two inputs being '0', which results in an output of '1', and any other combination results in an output of '0'.
