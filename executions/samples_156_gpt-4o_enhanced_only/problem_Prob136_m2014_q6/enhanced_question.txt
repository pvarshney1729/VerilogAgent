Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal, triggering on the positive edge.
  - `input wire reset` : Asynchronous reset signal. Active high.
  - `input wire w` : Control input, 1-bit width.
- Output:
  - `output reg z` : Output signal, 1-bit width.

State Machine Description:
- The state machine is defined with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- States are encoded as follows:
  - A: 3'b000
  - B: 3'b001
  - C: 3'b010
  - D: 3'b011
  - E: 3'b100
  - F: 3'b101
  
State Transitions:
- From state A:
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state B.
  - On input `w = 1`, remain in state A.
- From state B:
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state C.
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.
- From state C:
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state E.
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.
- From state D:
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state F.
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state A.
- From state E:
  - On input `w = 0`, remain in state E.
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.
- From state F:
  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state C.
  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.

Output Logic:
- The output `z` is determined by the current state:
  - State E or F: `z = 1`
  - All other states: `z = 0`

Reset Behavior:
- The module initializes to state A upon reset. The output `z` is set to 0 in this state.
- The reset is asynchronous, meaning it can occur at any time and will immediately place the state machine back to state A.

Clocking and Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock signal.
- Ensure that state transitions and output logic are free of race conditions by updating states and outputs synchronously with the clock.

Edge Case Handling:
- The state machine is designed to handle all possible input combinations for each defined state.
- Any unexpected conditions or undefined states should be handled to default back to state A on the next clock cycle (though no such undefined states exist in the current design).
