All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  w\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement the state machine shown below:\n\n  A (0) --0--> B\n  A (0) --1--> A\n  B (0) --0--> C\n  B (0) --1--> D\n  C (0) --0--> E\n  C (0) --1--> D\n  D (0) --0--> F\n  D (0) --1--> A\n  E (1) --0--> E\n  E (1) --1--> D\n  F (1) --0--> C\n  F (1) --1--> D\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal, triggering on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire reset` : Asynchronous reset signal. Active high.\n  - `input wire w` : Control input, 1-bit width.\n- Output:\n  - `output reg z` : Output signal, 1-bit width.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The state machine is defined with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n- States are encoded as follows:\n  - A: 3'b000\n  - B: 3'b001\n  - C: 3'b010\n  - D: 3'b011\n  - E: 3'b100\n  - F: 3'b101\n  \nState Transitions:\n- From state A:\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state B.\n  - On input `w = 1`, remain in state A.\n- From state B:\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state C.\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.\n- From state C:\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state E.\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.\n- From state D:\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state F.\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state A.\n- From state E:\n  - On input `w = 0`, remain in state E.\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.\n- From state F:\n  - On input `w = 0`, transition to state C.\n  - On input `w = 1`, transition to state D.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output `z` is determined by the current state:\n  - State E or F: `z = 1`\n  - All other states: `z = 0`\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module initializes to state A upon reset. The output `z` is set to 0 in this state.\n- The reset is asynchronous, meaning it can occur at any time and will immediately place the state machine back to state A.\n\nClocking and Sequential Logic:\n- All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock signal.\n- Ensure that state transitions and output logic are free of race conditions by updating states and outputs synchronously with the clock.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The state machine is designed to handle all possible input combinations for each defined state.\n- Any unexpected conditions or undefined states should be handled to default back to state A on the next clock cycle (though no such undefined states exist in the current design).\n                    "
