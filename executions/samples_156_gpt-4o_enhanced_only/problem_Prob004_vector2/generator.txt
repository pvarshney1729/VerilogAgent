Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation for the `TopModule` that reverses the byte order of a 32-bit input vector. This implementation follows the guidelines and conventions specified:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [31:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    // Reverse the byte order of the input
    always @(*) begin
        out[31:24] = in[7:0];   // Least significant byte of 'in' becomes most significant byte of 'out'
        out[23:16] = in[15:8];  // Third most significant byte of 'in' becomes second most significant byte of 'out'
        out[15:8]  = in[23:16]; // Second most significant byte of 'in' becomes third most significant byte of 'out'
        out[7:0]   = in[31:24]; // Most significant byte of 'in' becomes least significant byte of 'out'
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This code effectively reverses the byte order of a 32-bit input, meeting all the specified requirements. The `always @(*)` block ensures that the output is updated whenever the input changes, maintaining a purely combinational design.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic [31:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    // Reverse the byte order of the input
    always @(*) begin
        out[31:24] = in[7:0];   // Least significant byte of 'in' becomes most significant byte of 'out'
        out[23:16] = in[15:8];  // Third most significant byte of 'in' becomes second most significant byte of 'out'
        out[15:8]  = in[23:16]; // Second most significant byte of 'in' becomes third most significant byte of 'out'
        out[7:0]   = in[31:24]; // Most significant byte of 'in' becomes least significant byte of 'out'
    end
