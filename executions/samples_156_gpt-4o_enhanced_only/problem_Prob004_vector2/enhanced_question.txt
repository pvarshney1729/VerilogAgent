Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 32 bits
  - Bit Indexing: bit[31] is the most significant bit (MSB), bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 32 bits
  - Bit Indexing: bit[31] is the most significant bit (MSB), bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)

Functional Specification:
The module's primary function is to reverse the byte order of the 32-bit input vector 'in'. This means that:

- The most significant byte (in[31:24]) becomes the least significant byte (out[7:0]).
- The second most significant byte (in[23:16]) becomes the second least significant byte (out[15:8]).
- The third most significant byte (in[15:8]) becomes the second most significant byte (out[23:16]).
- The least significant byte (in[7:0]) becomes the most significant byte (out[31:24]).

Behavioral Details:
- The operation is purely combinational with no clock or reset dependencies.
- There are no sequential elements; therefore, no initial values or reset conditions apply.

Boundary Conditions:
- The module expects all 32 bits of the input to be valid and will output the reversed byte order accordingly.
- No undefined or edge cases are present as the operation applies uniformly across all possible 32-bit input values.
