Specification for Verilog Module: TopModule

Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, used for triggering sequential logic operations on the rising edge.
  - `input wire L`: Load signal, used to control the loading behavior.
  - `input wire q_in`: A single-bit input to the multiplexer.
  - `input wire r_in`: A single-bit input to the multiplexer.

- Outputs:
  - `output wire Q`: A single-bit output representing the final state of the flip-flop.

Description:
- The `TopModule` is designed to encapsulate a 2:1 multiplexer and a D-type flip-flop.
- The multiplexer selects between `q_in` and `r_in` based on the `L` signal.
  - When `L` is high (`1`), the output `Q` should be set to `r_in`.
  - When `L` is low (`0`), the output `Q` should be set to `q_in`.
- The selected input is then stored in a D-type flip-flop which captures the input on the rising edge of `clk`.
- The flip-flop does not have an explicit reset condition in this specification, implying it retains its state across resets unless otherwise handled externally.
- The operation of `TopModule` is purely sequential, with all state updates occurring on the rising edge of the `clk`.

Notes on Implementation:
- Ensure that the multiplexer logic is combinational, directly reflecting changes in `L`, `q_in`, and `r_in` to its output prior to clocking.
- The flip-flop should capture the multiplexer output on each rising edge of `clk`, updating the output `Q` accordingly.

Edge Case Handling:
- As there is no reset, initial conditions are not defined in this specification. It is assumed the initial state of `Q` is determined externally or by default simulation conditions.
- The behavior of the flip-flop when `clk` has a non-ideal transition (such as glitches) is not specified here and should be handled by proper clock conditioning in the broader design.

This specification does not include the implementation of the `full_module`, which will instantiate the `TopModule` three times to manage three separate bits of data.
