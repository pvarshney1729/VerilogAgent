Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in1`: 1-bit wide input signal. Represents the first input to the NOR gate. 
  - `input wire in2`: 1-bit wide input signal. Represents the second input to the NOR gate.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: 1-bit wide output signal. Represents the result of the NOR operation on inputs `in1` and `in2`.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 2-input NOR gate. The output `out` is a logical NOR of the inputs `in1` and `in2`.
- The NOR operation is defined as: 
  \[
  \text{out} = \overline{\text{in1} \lor \text{in2}}
  \]
  where \(\lor\) denotes the logical OR operation and \(\overline{\cdot}\) denotes the logical NOT operation.

Operational Details:
- Combinational Logic: The module consists solely of combinational logic. There are no sequential elements such as flip-flops or registers.
- Timing: The output `out` will reflect changes in `in1` or `in2` immediately, with only the propagation delay of the logic gate.
- Bit Indexing: The inputs and output are single bits, so no MSB/LSB indexing is necessary.

Additional Considerations:
- The module does not include any clock or reset signals, as it comprises only combinational logic.
- There are no race conditions or precedence issues due to the simple nature of the NOR gate.
- The expected behavior is deterministic, with no undefined states or conditions.
- Edge cases are inherently managed, as all possible input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) are valid for a NOR gate.

This specification provides a clear and detailed description of the module's intended behavior, ensuring correct implementation.
