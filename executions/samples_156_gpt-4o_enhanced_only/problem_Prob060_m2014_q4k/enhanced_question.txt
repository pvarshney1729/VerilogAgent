Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input wire resetn: Active-low synchronous reset. When 'resetn' is low, the shift register resets.
- input wire in: Single-bit data input for the shift register.
- output reg out: Single-bit data output, representing the last stage of the shift register.

Behavior:
- The module implements a 4-bit shift register using D flip-flops.
- All flip-flops are positive edge-triggered by the 'clk' signal.
- The synchronous reset is active when 'resetn' is low. When activated, all bits in the shift register are reset to 0.
- Bit indexing: The shift register consists of four stages, indexed as stage[3] (most significant bit) to stage[0] (least significant bit). Stage[3] is the output bit.
- Data is shifted in from the 'in' input to stage[0], and shifts towards stage[3] on each positive clock edge.
- Initial State: On reset, all bits in the shift register are initialized to 0.

Special Conditions:
- During synchronous reset (when 'resetn' is 0 on a clock edge), all stages of the shift register are set to 0, and 'out' will output 0.
- Ensure no race conditions occur between clock and reset signals by adhering to synchronous reset behavior.
- The behavior at the boundaries of input (e.g., consecutive reset activations) should adhere to the described synchronous reset operation, consistently resetting the shift register to 0.

Note:
- The output 'out' reflects the value of stage[3] and updates with each clock cycle after the reset condition is cleared (resetn = 1).
- Ensure that no intermediate states or glitches occur on 'out' during reset or normal operation.
