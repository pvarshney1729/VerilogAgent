Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [99:0] in`: A 100-bit wide input vector. Bit index 0 is the least significant bit (LSB), and bit index 99 is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `output [99:0] out_both`: A 100-bit wide output vector.
  - `output [99:0] out_any`: A 100-bit wide output vector.
  - `output [99:0] out_different`: A 100-bit wide output vector.

Functional Behavior:
1. `out_both`:
   - For each bit `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ 98), `out_both[i]` should be `1` if both `in[i]` and `in[i+1]` are `1`. Otherwise, it should be `0`.
   - Set `out_both[99]` to `0` since `in[99]` has no neighbor to the left.

2. `out_any`:
   - For each bit `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ 99), `out_any[i]` should be `1` if either `in[i]` or `in[i-1]` is `1`. Otherwise, it should be `0`.
   - Set `out_any[0]` to `0` since `in[0]` has no neighbor to the right.

3. `out_different`:
   - For each bit `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ 99), `out_different[i]` should be `1` if `in[i]` is different from `in[i-1]`. Otherwise, it should be `0`.
   - For `in[0]`, treat the vector as wrapping around: set `out_different[0]` to `1` if `in[0]` is different from `in[99]`.

Implementation Notes:
- This module is purely combinational logic, with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.
- All operations should be evaluated concurrently without any temporal sequence or dependency.
- Assume all input bits are valid binary values (0 or 1) without any undefined states.
