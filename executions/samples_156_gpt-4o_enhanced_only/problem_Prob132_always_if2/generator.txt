Generated Response:

Certainly! Let's implement the module based on the specified functionality and correct the issues noted in the original design. Here is the corrected Verilog code:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic cpu_overheated,
    output logic shut_off_computer,
    input logic arrived,
    input logic gas_tank_empty,
    output logic keep_driving
);

    // Combinational logic for shutting off the computer
    always_comb begin
        shut_off_computer = cpu_overheated;
    end

    // Combinational logic for driving decision
    always_comb begin
        keep_driving = ~arrived && ~gas_tank_empty;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **`shut_off_computer` Logic**: This output is directly driven by the `cpu_overheated` input. If `cpu_overheated` is true (1), then `shut_off_computer` will also be true.
  
- **`keep_driving` Logic**: This output is true (1) only when the vehicle has not arrived (`~arrived`) and the gas tank is not empty (`~gas_tank_empty`). Both conditions must be true for `keep_driving` to be set to true.

- **Combinational Logic**: Both outputs are determined using combinational logic (`always_comb`), ensuring that they react immediately to changes in the inputs.

This implementation resolves any ambiguity in the output behavior and adheres to the guidelines and conventions provided.
