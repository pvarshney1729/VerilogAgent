<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, is designed to implement a finite-state machine (FSM) with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input clk` : Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- `input reset` : Synchronous active-high reset signal.
- `input x` : Input signal affecting state transition.
- `output z` : Output signal determined by the current state.

### FSM Details

- **State Encoding**: The FSM has states encoded as a 3-bit vector `y[2:0]`. The least significant bit is `y[0]`.
  - State 000: Initial state after reset.
  - State transitions depend on the input `x` as specified in the state transition table.

- **Reset Behavior**: The reset is synchronous and active high. When `reset` is asserted (high), the FSM transitions to the initial state `000` on the next positive edge of `clk`.

- **Clocking**: All state changes occur on the positive edge of `clk`.

- **State Transition Table**:

  | Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State `y[2:0]` when `x=0` | Next State `y[2:0]` when `x=1` | Output `z` |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|
  | 000                    | 000                             | 001                             | 0          |
  | 001                    | 001                             | 100                             | 0          |
  | 010                    | 010                             | 001                             | 0          |
  | 011                    | 001                             | 010                             | 1          |
  | 100                    | 011                             | 100                             | 1          |

- **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined solely by the current state `y[2:0]` as indicated in the transition table.

- **Initial Values**: On reset, set `y[2:0]` to `000` and `z` to 0.

### Edge Cases and Input Boundaries

- For undefined states or transitions, ensure the FSM remains stable and defaults to state `000` on reset.
- The module should handle all possible combinations of input signals (`x` and `reset`) and transition appropriately based on the clock edge.

This specification ensures that the FSM is correctly implemented with clearly defined states, transitions, and output behaviors. It also specifies synchronous reset and edge-triggered state transitions, aligning with typical digital design practices.
