Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in`: A 1-bit unsigned signal representing the input to the NOT gate.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: A 1-bit unsigned signal representing the output of the NOT gate.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a NOT gate, which is a basic combinational logic element.
- The NOT gate inverts the input signal. Thus, if `in` is 0, `out` will be 1, and if `in` is 1, `out` will be 0.

Additional Details:
- All signals are treated as unsigned.
- This module is purely combinational, with no clock or reset required.
- The operation is independent of clock cycles, and output changes immediately in response to input changes.
- Bit Indexing: As the input and output are single-bit signals, no specific indexing is necessary.
- Edge Cases: The module operates correctly for all possible values of `in` (0 or 1), as it is a simple inversion logic.
