Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in` : A single-bit input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out` : A single-bit output signal that directly reflects the input.

Functional Description:
- The module `TopModule` functions as a direct pass-through or "wire" from the input `in` to the output `out`.
- The output `out` is continuously updated to match the input `in` without any delay or modification.

Port Definitions and Conventions:
- All ports are defined as single-bit, unsigned signals.
- The least significant bit (LSB) is denoted as bit[0].

Operational Characteristics:
- The module is purely combinational logic, with no internal state or storage elements.
- There are no clock or reset signals, as the module does not include any sequential logic components.

Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The behavior of the module is consistent for all possible single-bit values of the input `in` (i.e., `0` or `1`).
- No undefined states or race conditions exist due to the direct mapping of `in` to `out`.
