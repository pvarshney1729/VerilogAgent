Here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that behaves like a wire, directly connecting the input to the output:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input wire in,
    output wire out
);
    // Directly connect the input to the output
    assign out = in;
endmodule
[DONE] 

This implementation uses an `assign` statement to continuously assign the value of `in` to `out`, effectively making the module behave like a wire. The use of `wire` in the port declarations aligns with the requirement for combinational logic, as there is no need for storage elements or sensitivity lists.
