Module Name: TopModule

1. **Port Definitions:**
   - **Inputs:**
     - `input wire a;`  // One-bit input
     - `input wire b;`  // One-bit input
     - `input wire c;`  // One-bit input
     - `input wire d;`  // One-bit input
   - **Outputs:**
     - `output wire q;` // One-bit output

2. **Circuit Type:**
   - This module should implement a combinational logic circuit. There are no clock signals or sequential elements involved.

3. **Signal Description and Behavior:**
   - The output `q` is determined based on the input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as per the provided truth table.
   - The table below summarizes the conditions under which `q` is asserted (logic '1'):

     | a | b | c | d | q |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
     | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
     | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
     | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
     | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
     | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
     | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
     | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
     | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Determine the logic expression for `q` by analyzing the truth table. The output `q` is '1' for the following input combinations where:
     - `c` is '1', OR
     - `b` is '1' AND `d` is either '0' or '1'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - All possible combinations of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are covered by the truth table.

6. **Conventions:**
   - Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single bits.
   - No assumptions are made about the signedness of the inputs and output as they are one-bit wide.

7. **Notes:**
   - Ensure that this module remains purely combinational with no latches or flip-flops inadvertently inferred.
