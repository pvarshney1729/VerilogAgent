Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. The flip-flops are triggered on the negative edge of this clock.
  - reset: 1-bit active high synchronous reset signal.
  - d: 8-bit data input, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - q: 8-bit registered output, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).

Functional Description:
- The module comprises 8 D flip-flops.
- Each flip-flop stores one bit of the 8-bit input `d`.
- All flip-flops share a common clock (`clk`) and synchronous reset (`reset`).
- Flip-flops are triggered on the negative edge of the clock signal (`clk`).

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and active high.
- On asserting `reset` (i.e., `reset` goes high) during the next negative edge of `clk`, the output `q` is set to the specific 8-bit binary value `0x34` (00110100 in binary).
- If `reset` is low, the flip-flops capture the input `d` on the next negative edge of `clk`.

Initial Values:
- Upon power-up, the flip-flops should be initialized to hold the value `0x34`, ensuring a known start state regardless of the `reset` signal status at power-up.

Operational Details:
- The transition of `q` depends on the negative edge of `clk`.
- In the absence of a reset, the output `q` updates to match the input `d` at every negative clock edge.
- Ensure no race conditions by maintaining the synchronous nature of the reset and clear definition of clock edge triggering.

Edge Cases:
- If `clk` has glitches or does not have a clear negative edge, the behavior is undefined.
- Ensure that `reset` remains stable during the clock's negative edge to avoid unintended behavior.

Constraints:
- All input and output signals must be stable and free from metastability issues at the time of clock transition.

This specification ensures clarity for a correct Verilog implementation of the described behavior.
