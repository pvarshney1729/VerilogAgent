Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: 
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
- Output: 
  - q: 4-bit output representing the current count value.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive.
- The counter is incremented by 1 on each positive edge of the clock signal (clk).
- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high. When reset is high, the counter resets to 0 on the next positive edge of the clock.
- The counter output 'q' should have the following characteristics:
  - Bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Initial Conditions:
- On reset, the counter initializes to a value of 0.

Edge Cases and Special Conditions:
- After reaching the value 9 (binary 1001), the counter will wrap around to 0 on the next clock cycle.
- Ensure all transitions and operations are free from race conditions and handled within the clock cycle.

Operational Constraints:
- All operations are governed by the positive edge of the clock signal.
- The counter must handle the synchronous reset appropriately within the same clock cycle edge.
