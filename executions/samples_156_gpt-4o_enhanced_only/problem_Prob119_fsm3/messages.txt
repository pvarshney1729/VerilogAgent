All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  areset\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement a Moore state machine with the following\nstate transition table with one input, one output, and four states.\nImplement this state machine. Include a positive edge triggered\nasynchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A. Assume all sequential\nlogic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n  state | next state in=0, next state in=1 | output\n  A     | A, B                             | 0\n  B     | C, B                             | 0\n  C     | A, D                             | 0\n  D     | C, B                             | 1\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for triggering sequential logic on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high, used to reset the state machine.\n  - `input wire in`: Input signal for state transitions.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg out`: Output signal of the state machine.\n\nState Machine Specification:\n- Type: Moore State Machine\n- States: Four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.\n  \nState Encoding:\n- State A: 2'b00\n- State B: 2'b01\n- State C: 2'b10\n- State D: 2'b11\n\nState Transition Table:\n- From State A:\n  - If `in` = 0, transition to State A.\n  - If `in` = 1, transition to State B.\n  - Output: 0\n- From State B:\n  - If `in` = 0, transition to State C.\n  - If `in` = 1, remain in State B.\n  - Output: 0\n- From State C:\n  - If `in` = 0, transition to State A.\n  - If `in` = 1, transition to State D.\n  - Output: 0\n- From State D:\n  - If `in` = 0, transition to State C.\n  - If `in` = 1, transition to State B.\n  - Output: 1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Asynchronous Reset: A positive edge of `areset` immediately resets the FSM to State A (2'b00).\n- All registers are initialized to their reset states on `areset`.\n\nClock Domain:\n- All sequential logic elements, including state registers, are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- The output `out` is defined by the current state and is independent of the input `in`.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon application of `areset`, the state machine is initialized to State A, and the output `out` is set to 0.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure that all transitions and outputs are correctly configured according to the state transition table.\n- Properly handle any potential race conditions by ensuring the correct precedence of state transitions.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- All possible input combinations and transitions are explicitly defined in the state transition table.\n- The state machine should robustly handle any input sequence according to the defined transitions.\n                    "
