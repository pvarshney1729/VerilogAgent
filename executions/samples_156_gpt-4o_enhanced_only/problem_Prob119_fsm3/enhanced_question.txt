Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for triggering sequential logic on the positive edge.
  - `input wire areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high, used to reset the state machine.
  - `input wire in`: Input signal for state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg out`: Output signal of the state machine.

State Machine Specification:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- States: Four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.
  
State Encoding:
- State A: 2'b00
- State B: 2'b01
- State C: 2'b10
- State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table:
- From State A:
  - If `in` = 0, transition to State A.
  - If `in` = 1, transition to State B.
  - Output: 0
- From State B:
  - If `in` = 0, transition to State C.
  - If `in` = 1, remain in State B.
  - Output: 0
- From State C:
  - If `in` = 0, transition to State A.
  - If `in` = 1, transition to State D.
  - Output: 0
- From State D:
  - If `in` = 0, transition to State C.
  - If `in` = 1, transition to State B.
  - Output: 1

Reset Behavior:
- Asynchronous Reset: A positive edge of `areset` immediately resets the FSM to State A (2'b00).
- All registers are initialized to their reset states on `areset`.

Clock Domain:
- All sequential logic elements, including state registers, are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.

Output Behavior:
- The output `out` is defined by the current state and is independent of the input `in`.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon application of `areset`, the state machine is initialized to State A, and the output `out` is set to 0.

Note:
- Ensure that all transitions and outputs are correctly configured according to the state transition table.
- Properly handle any potential race conditions by ensuring the correct precedence of state transitions.

Edge Case Handling:
- All possible input combinations and transitions are explicitly defined in the state transition table.
- The state machine should robustly handle any input sequence according to the defined transitions.
