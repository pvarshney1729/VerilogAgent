Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `in`: An 8-bit wide input vector. The bit at index 0, `in[0]`, refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and `in[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: An 8-bit wide output vector. The bit at index 0, `out[0]`, refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and `out[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

Functional Description:
- The module performs a bit-reversal operation on the 8-bit input vector and produces the result on the 8-bit output vector.
- Specifically, the output `out` should be assigned as follows:
  - `out[7]` = `in[0]`
  - `out[6]` = `in[1]`
  - `out[5]` = `in[2]`
  - `out[4]` = `in[3]`
  - `out[3]` = `in[4]`
  - `out[2]` = `in[5]`
  - `out[1]` = `in[6]`
  - `out[0]` = `in[7]`

Additional Details:
- The logic is purely combinational, meaning there is no clock or reset signal involved.
- The output should be updated immediately following any change in the input, ensuring that the propagation delay is consistent with combinational logic.
- No initial values need to be set for the input and output ports as they are driven by external sources or by the module logic itself.
- Edge cases such as all bits being 0 or all bits being 1 should result in direct bit reversal without any additional handling as the operation is inherently symmetric.
