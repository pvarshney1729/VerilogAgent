Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Inputs:
  - input wire a; // One-bit input signal
  - input wire b; // One-bit input signal
  - input wire c; // One-bit input signal
  - input wire d; // One-bit input signal
- Output:
  - output wire out; // One-bit output signal

Functional Description:
- The module TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit based on the given Karnaugh map, which defines the output for each combination of inputs a, b, c, and d.
- The inputs a and b are used to form the columns of the Karnaugh map, while c and d form the rows as follows:
  - 'a' is the most significant bit (MSB) of the columns, and 'b' is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - 'c' is the most significant bit (MSB) of the rows, and 'd' is the least significant bit (LSB).
- The output 'out' is determined by the following truth table derived from the Karnaugh map:

              ab
   cd   00  01  11  10
   00 |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
   01 |  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
   11 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
   10 |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |

- The output 'out' should be true (1) or false (0) according to the above table, mapping each input combination to its corresponding output value.

Additional Implementation Details:
- This is a purely combinational circuit with no sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops, registers).
- No clock signal is required as there is no sequential logic involved.
- The design does not require a reset signal since there are no memory elements.
- Ensure that the implementation of logic gates accurately reflects the specified truth table to meet the required functional behavior for all input combinations.
- The order of precedence for logical operations should be clearly defined in the implementation to avoid ambiguity.
- Edge cases for input combinations are inherently covered by the Karnaugh map, ensuring all possible combinations of inputs are addressed.
