Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal. Positive edge-triggered.
  - `input wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset.
  - `input wire s` : State control signal for transitioning from state A to state B.
  - `input wire w` : Data input signal examined in state B.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg z` : Output signal set to 1 based on FSM logic.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- States: Two states are defined, `A` (reset state) and `B`.
- Initial State: The FSM begins in state `A` upon reset.

State Transition Logic:
- State `A`: 
  - The FSM remains in state `A` as long as `s = 0`.
  - Transition from state `A` to state `B` occurs when `s = 1`.

- State `B`: 
  - In state `B`, the FSM examines the value of `w` for three consecutive clock cycles.
  - A counter mechanism is used to count the occurrences of `w = 1` during these cycles.
  - After three cycles, if `w` equals 1 in exactly two of these cycles, then `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
  - The FSM continues this three-cycle checking process on `w` indefinitely as long as it remains in state `B`.

Operational Details:
- All transitions and operations are synchronous with the `clk` signal.
- `z` is updated immediately following the three-cycle analysis of `w`.
- Reset Logic: On the assertion of `reset`, the FSM moves back to state `A`, and any registers or counters are reset to a defined initial state, typically zero.

Signal Indexing and Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are single-bit.
- Signal precedence and dependencies are clearly defined in the state transition and output logic.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The FSM handles all inputs synchronously with clock edges.
- Proper handling of the reset and transition conditions ensures no race conditions or undefined states occur.

Initial Values:
- Upon reset, all internal registers and counters are initialized to zero or their respective default values as defined in the implementation.
