All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  s\n - input  w\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine with inputs s and w.\nAssume that the FSM begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below.\nThe FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when\ns = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the\nnext three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles,\nthen the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle.\nOtherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three\nclock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s\ninput is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.\nAssume reset is active high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is\ntriggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal. Positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset.\n  - `input wire s` : State control signal for transitioning from state A to state B.\n  - `input wire w` : Data input signal examined in state B.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg z` : Output signal set to 1 based on FSM logic.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- States: Two states are defined, `A` (reset state) and `B`.\n- Initial State: The FSM begins in state `A` upon reset.\n\nState Transition Logic:\n- State `A`: \n  - The FSM remains in state `A` as long as `s = 0`.\n  - Transition from state `A` to state `B` occurs when `s = 1`.\n\n- State `B`: \n  - In state `B`, the FSM examines the value of `w` for three consecutive clock cycles.\n  - A counter mechanism is used to count the occurrences of `w = 1` during these cycles.\n  - After three cycles, if `w` equals 1 in exactly two of these cycles, then `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.\n  - The FSM continues this three-cycle checking process on `w` indefinitely as long as it remains in state `B`.\n\nOperational Details:\n- All transitions and operations are synchronous with the `clk` signal.\n- `z` is updated immediately following the three-cycle analysis of `w`.\n- Reset Logic: On the assertion of `reset`, the FSM moves back to state `A`, and any registers or counters are reset to a defined initial state, typically zero.\n\nSignal Indexing and Conventions:\n- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n- Signal precedence and dependencies are clearly defined in the state transition and output logic.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The FSM handles all inputs synchronously with clock edges.\n- Proper handling of the reset and transition conditions ensures no race conditions or undefined states occur.\n\nInitial Values:\n- Upon reset, all internal registers and counters are initialized to zero or their respective default values as defined in the implementation.\n                    "
