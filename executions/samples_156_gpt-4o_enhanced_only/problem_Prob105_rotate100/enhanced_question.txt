Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input clk: Clock signal (1 bit). Positive edge-triggered.
- input load: Synchronous load control signal (1 bit). Active high.
- input [1:0] ena: Synchronous enable signal to control rotation direction (2 bits).
- input [99:0] data: Input data for loading into the shift register (100 bits).
- output reg [99:0] q: Output data representing the current state of the rotator (100 bits).

Functional Description:
1. The `TopModule` implements a 100-bit rotational shift register with synchronous load and directional control.
2. The rotation operation is distinct from a typical shift operation by retaining the bit shifted out and reintroducing it at the opposite end.

Operation Details:
1. Load (Synchronous): 
   - When `load` is high on the rising edge of `clk`, the register `q` is synchronously loaded with the value from `data[99:0]`.
   - If `load` is low, the register retains its current value unless modified by the rotation operation.

2. Rotation Enable (`ena`):
   - The `ena` signal determines whether and in which direction the rotation occurs:
     - `ena = 2'b01`: Rotate right by 1 bit position. The bit at `q[0]` is rotated to `q[99]`.
     - `ena = 2'b10`: Rotate left by 1 bit position. The bit at `q[99]` is rotated to `q[0]`.
     - `ena = 2'b00` or `ena = 2'b11`: No rotation. The contents of `q` remain unchanged.

3. Output (`q`):
   - `q` reflects the current value of the rotational shift register after the synchronous operations of loading and/or rotating.

Implementation Notes:
- The system is fully synchronous with respect to the `clk` signal.
- All operations occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
- Ensure that `q` is initialized to a known state (e.g., all zeros) on reset if a reset functionality is added.
- If a reset is required, specify whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and its initial state.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- Confirm behavior for all `ena` states to ensure no unintended rotations.
- Ensure proper bit wrapping during rotations to avoid data corruption.
