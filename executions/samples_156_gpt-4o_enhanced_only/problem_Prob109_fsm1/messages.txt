When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named `TopModule` is to be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit wide.\n\n- `input clk` : This is the clock input signal, used for synchronizing the state transitions.\n- `input areset` : This is an asynchronous reset input signal. When high, it resets the state machine to the initial state.\n- `input in` : This is the input signal used for state transitions.\n- `output reg out` : This is the output signal of the Moore machine, driven by the current state.\n\nThe module is a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:\n\n1. **States**: The state machine consists of two states:\n   - State A (Output = 0)\n   - State B (Output = 1)\n\n2. **State Transitions**:\n   - From State B:\n     - On `in = 0`, transition to State A.\n     - On `in = 1`, remain in State B.\n   - From State A:\n     - On `in = 0`, transition to State B.\n     - On `in = 1`, remain in State A.\n\n3. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active high.\n   - When `areset` is high, the state machine transitions immediately to State B, regardless of the clock.\n   - State B is the initial state upon reset.\n\n4. **Output Behavior**:\n   - The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and remains constant throughout each state.\n   - `out = 0` when in State A.\n   - `out = 1` when in State B.\n\n5. **Implementation Notes**:\n   - The state transitions are synchronized with the rising edge of the `clk`.\n   - Ensure that the `out` signal is updated immediately after a state transition to accurately reflect the current state.\n   - Define states using a two-state enumerated type or equivalent, and manage state transitions via a state register updated on each clock cycle, with the reset condition handled asynchronously.\n\nBy adhering to the specification above, the module will function as a Moore state machine with defined behavior, reset conditions, and state-dependent output.\n                    "
