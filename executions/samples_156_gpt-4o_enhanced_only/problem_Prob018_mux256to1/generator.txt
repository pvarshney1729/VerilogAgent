Below is the Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per the specifications outlined:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [255:0] in,
    input logic [7:0] sel,
    output logic out
);

    // Combinational logic to select the appropriate bit from the input vector
    always @(*) begin
        out = in[sel];
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Input Ports**: The `in` is a 256-bit wide input vector, and `sel` is an 8-bit wide selector.
- **Output Port**: The `out` is a 1-bit output.
- **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block ensures that the logic is purely combinational. The `out` is directly assigned the value of the selected bit from the `in` vector using `in[sel]`.
- **Selector**: The `sel` input is used to index into the `in` vector to select which bit should be driven to the `out`.

This implementation is efficient and follows the given coding conventions and guidelines.
