Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as described. The module takes a 100-bit input vector and produces three single-bit outputs, each representing the result of a 100-input AND, OR, and XOR operation, respectively.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [99:0] in,
    output logic        out_and,
    output logic        out_or,
    output logic        out_xor
);

    // Use reduction operators to compute the outputs
    assign out_and = &in;  // Reduction AND
    assign out_or  = |in;  // Reduction OR
    assign out_xor = ^in;  // Reduction XOR

endmodule
[DONE]

In this module:
- The reduction operators `&`, `|`, and `^` are used to perform the AND, OR, and XOR operations across all bits of the input vector `in`.
- `&in` computes a logical AND across all bits, resulting in `out_and`.
- `|in` computes a logical OR across all bits, resulting in `out_or`.
- `^in` computes a logical XOR across all bits, resulting in `out_xor`.

This implementation uses concise and efficient reduction operators to achieve the desired functionality.
