All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in (100 bits)\n - output out_and\n - output out_or\n - output out_xor\n\nThe module should implement a combinational circuit with 100 inputs,\nin[99:0]. There are 3 outputs:\n\n  (1) out_and : output of a 100-input AND gate\n  (2) out_or  : output of a 100-input OR  gate\n  (3) out_xor : output of a 100-input XOR gate\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, is a combinational logic circuit with the following interface specifications. All input and output ports are single-bit signals unless otherwise noted. The input signal is a 100-bit vector, and the module produces three single-bit outputs.\n\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire [99:0] in`: A 100-bit input vector where `in[99]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out_and`: Represents the result of a logical AND operation across all bits of the input vector `in`.\n  - `output wire out_or`: Represents the result of a logical OR operation across all bits of the input vector `in`.\n  - `output wire out_xor`: Represents the result of a logical XOR operation across all bits of the input vector `in`.\n\nDetailed Operation:\n1. `out_and`: This output is high (`1`) if all bits in the input vector `in[99:0]` are high (`1`). It is low (`0`) if any bit in the vector is low (`0`).\n\n2. `out_or`: This output is high (`1`) if at least one bit in the input vector `in[99:0]` is high (`1`). It is low (`0`) only if all bits in the vector are low (`0`).\n\n3. `out_xor`: This output is high (`1`) if there is an odd number of bits set to high (`1`) in the input vector `in[99:0]`. It is low (`0`) if there is an even number of bits set to high (`1`).\n\nNote: The module is purely combinational and does not involve any sequential elements, such as flip-flops or registers. Therefore, no clock signal or reset functionality is required. All operations are performed based on the current values of the input vector `in`.\n                    "
