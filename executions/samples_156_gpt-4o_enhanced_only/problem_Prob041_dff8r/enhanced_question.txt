Module Name: TopModule

Interface Definition:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronization. This is a single-bit input.
  - `input wire reset`: Active high reset signal. This is a single-bit input.
  - `input wire [7:0] d`: 8-bit data input where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Outputs:
  - `output reg [7:0] q`: 8-bit data output with the same bit ordering as the input `d`. 

Behavioral Specification:
- The module consists of 8 D-type flip-flops.
- Each flip-flop corresponds to one bit of the 8-bit `d` input and one bit of the `q` output.
- All flip-flops are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
- The reset signal is synchronous and active high:
  - When `reset` is asserted (logic high) during a clock edge, all bits of `q` should be set to zero.
  - If `reset` is not asserted, the output `q` should capture and hold the value of `d` at each positive edge of `clk`.

Initial Conditions and Edge Cases:
- Upon assertion of the `reset` signal, the output `q` is initialized to zero regardless of the `d` input value.
- Ensure that the reset operation takes precedence over data capturing, meaning `reset` will override `d` when asserted.
- The module does not specify behavior for metastability or setup/hold violations, these should be managed at the system design level.

Note: Ensure that timing constraints are met to avoid race conditions, especially around the clock edge where `reset` and `d` can change.
