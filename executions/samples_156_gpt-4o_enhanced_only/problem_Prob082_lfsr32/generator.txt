Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified tap positions. The module is designed with a synchronous reset and adheres to the coding conventions provided.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [31:0] q
);

    // Internal signal to hold the state of the LFSR
    logic [31:0] lfsr_state;

    // Sequential block handling the clock and synchronous reset
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            lfsr_state <= 32'h1; // Reset state
        end else begin
            // Next state logic for Galois LFSR
            lfsr_state <= {lfsr_state[30:0], feedback_bit};
        end
    end

    // Feedback calculation
    logic feedback_bit;
    assign feedback_bit = lfsr_state[0] ^ lfsr_state[1] ^ lfsr_state[21] ^ lfsr_state[31];

    // Output assignment
    assign q = lfsr_state;

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation:
- **Clock and Reset**: The `always_ff` block is used for synthesizing flip-flops, which operate on the positive edge of `clk` and handle the synchronous reset.
- **LFSR State**: The `lfsr_state` register holds the current state of the LFSR and is updated every clock cycle based on the feedback logic.
- **Feedback Logic**: The feedback bit is computed by XORing the LSB (`lfsr_state[0]`) with the tapped positions (`lfsr_state[1]`, `lfsr_state[21]`, `lfsr_state[31]`).
- **State Shifting**: The LFSR shifts to the right by concatenating the `feedback_bit` to the leftmost position of the state.
- **Output Assignment**: The current state of the LFSR (`lfsr_state`) is continuously assigned to the output `q`. 

This implementation ensures that the LFSR operates correctly with the specified tap positions and handles the synchronous reset appropriately.
