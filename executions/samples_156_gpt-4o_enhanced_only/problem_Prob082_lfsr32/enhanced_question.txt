Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: clk (1-bit)
  - Description: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.
  - Trigger: Positive edge-triggered.
  
- Input: reset (1-bit)
  - Description: Active-high synchronous reset.
  - Behavior: When high, resets output q to its initial state.
  
- Output: q (32-bit)
  - Description: 32-bit output representing the current state of the Galois LFSR.
  - Initial Value: Reset to 32'h1 upon reset assertion.

Operational Details:
- Function: This module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- Operation:
  - The LFSR shifts right on each positive edge of the clk.
  - Taps are located at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0 (using zero-based indexing where bit[0] is the LSB).
  - The next state of a tapped position is determined by XORing its current value with q[0] (the current LSB).

- Reset Behavior:
  - Type: Synchronous
  - When the reset signal is asserted (high), the output q is reset to 32'h1 on the next positive clock edge.

- Sequential Logic:
  - All state changes occur on the rising edge of clk.
  - The shifting and feedback operations are governed by the specified tap positions.

Edge Cases:
- On reset, q is always set to 32'h1 regardless of its previous state.
- Ensure proper handling of the LSB during XOR operation to avoid race conditions.

Implementation Note:
- Ensure the bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] is the most significant bit (MSB).
- The tap positions are applied as follows: XOR the output LSB (q[0]) with bits at positions 31, 21, 1, and 0 to determine their next state.
