Certainly! Let's implement the corrected version of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer module. Here is the Verilog code:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    // Use a combinational assignment to select between a and b based on sel
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- The `out` signal is declared as an 8-bit output to match the width of the inputs `a` and `b`.
- The assignment `assign out = sel ? b : a;` uses a conditional (ternary) operator to choose between `b` and `a`. If `sel` is 1, `b` is selected; otherwise, `a` is selected.
- This approach ensures that the multiplexer correctly selects between the two 8-bit inputs based on the `sel` signal, fixing the bug from the original implementation that incorrectly used bitwise operations.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    // Use a combinational assignment to select between a and b based on sel
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
