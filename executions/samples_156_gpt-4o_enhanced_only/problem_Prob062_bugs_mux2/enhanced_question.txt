Module Specification: 8-bit 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Module Overview:
This specification describes the implementation of a corrected 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer. The multiplexer selects between two 8-bit inputs based on a single-bit select signal and outputs the selected 8-bit value.

Port Definitions:
- `sel` (input, 1 bit): This is the selection control signal. When `sel` is 0, the output will be the value of input `a`. When `sel` is 1, the output will be the value of input `b`.
- `a` (input, 8 bits): An 8-bit input vector. The most significant bit is `a[7]` and the least significant bit is `a[0]`.
- `b` (input, 8 bits): Another 8-bit input vector. The most significant bit is `b[7]` and the least significant bit is `b[0]`.
- `out` (output, 8 bits): The output vector which reflects the selected input based on the `sel` signal. The most significant bit is `out[7]` and the least significant bit is `out[0]`.

Functional Description:
- The multiplexer operates combinationally and outputs the selected 8-bit input vector (`a` or `b`) based on the value of `sel`.
- The expression used to determine the output is: `out = sel ? b : a;`.
- The output `out` reflects changes in `sel`, `a`, or `b` immediately as this is a purely combinational circuit.

Implementation Clarifications:
- Ensure that the logical operation used correctly selects between the two input vectors without bitwise operation errors.
- The module must be implemented to ensure no race conditions or glitches occur during operation.

Boundary Conditions:
- All input combinations of `sel`, `a`, and `b` should be correctly handled by the logic to ensure valid outputs are generated.
- The system assumes that inputs `a` and `b` are stable and valid during operation.

Note: This specification assumes a zero-delay model for combinational logic, as is typical in Verilog simulations, ensuring immediate propagation of changes through the circuit.
