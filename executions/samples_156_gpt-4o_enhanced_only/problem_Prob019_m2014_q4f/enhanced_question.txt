<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Port Descriptions:
- Input: `in1` (1 bit, unsigned)
- Input: `in2` (1 bit, unsigned)
- Output: `out` (1 bit, unsigned)

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The circuit consists of an AND gate with the following characteristics:
  - Input `in1` is directly connected to one input of the AND gate.
  - Input `in2` is inverted (i.e., has a bubble) before connecting to the other input of the AND gate.
- The output of the AND gate is directly connected to the module output `out`.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All ports are 1 bit wide, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit.

Logical Representation:
- `out` = `in1` AND (NOT `in2`)

Edge Case Considerations:
- The module operates purely on a combinational logic basis, with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.
- Input values are treated as binary, with logical operations performed directly on bit[0].
- The circuit does not consider any reset or initial state as it is a combinational logic design.

There are no dependencies on clock edges or reset signals for this module, as it only involves combinational logic.
