Generated Response:

Based on the given truth table and the derived logic expression, let's implement the `TopModule` in Verilog. The expression for `q` is derived as `q = (b & d) | (a & d) | (a & c)`.

Here is the implementation of the module:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic for output q
    always @(*) begin
        q = (b & d) | (a & d) | (a & c);
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This code implements the logic for `q` based on the required combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as specified in the truth table. The use of `always @(*)` ensures that the combinational logic is evaluated whenever any of the inputs change.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic for output q
    always @(*) begin
        q = (b & d) | (a & d) | (a & c);
    end

endmodule
