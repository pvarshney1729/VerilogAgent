<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire b`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire c`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire d`: Single-bit input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire q`: Single-bit output signal.

Circuit Characteristics:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit, meaning that the output `q` is determined solely by the current input values (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) without any memory or feedback.

Bit Indexing:
- Each input and output signal is a single bit, with the least significant bit (LSB) being bit[0].

Functionality:
- The truth table below describes the logic for the output `q` based on inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`:

  | a | b | c | d | q |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- The logic can be described as `q = b & d | a & d | a & c`.

Edge Cases:
- All possible combinations of the input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are covered in the truth table above.
- The output `q` will be stable and valid immediately after any change in input signals, as this is a purely combinational circuit.

Timing:
- As this is a combinational circuit, no clock or timing constraints are applicable. The output `q` changes instantaneously with changes in the inputs.

Reset Conditions:
- Not applicable, as this is a combinational logic circuit with no state-holding elements.
