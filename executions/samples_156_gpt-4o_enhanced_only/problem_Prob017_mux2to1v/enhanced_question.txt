Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `a`: 100-bit wide input vector. Signal indexing is from bit[99] (most significant bit) to bit[0] (least significant bit).
  - `b`: 100-bit wide input vector. Signal indexing is from bit[99] (most significant bit) to bit[0] (least significant bit).
  - `sel`: 1-bit wide input signal used as the select line for the multiplexer. 

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 100-bit wide output vector. Signal indexing is from bit[99] (most significant bit) to bit[0] (least significant bit).

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer with the following behavior:
  - When `sel` is 0, the output `out` should be directly assigned the value of input `a`.
  - When `sel` is 1, the output `out` should be directly assigned the value of input `b`.

- The logic is purely combinational without any clock dependencies, meaning there are no sequential elements or registers involved.

- The inputs `a` and `b` are treated as unsigned vectors for the purpose of this operation.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure proper handling of all 100 bits within the vectors `a` and `b` during multiplexing, with no loss of data or misalignment.
- The module must consistently reflect changes in inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel` in the output `out` without delay, assuming combinational logic.
