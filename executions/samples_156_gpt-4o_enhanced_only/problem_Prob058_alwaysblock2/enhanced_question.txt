Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: `clk` (1 bit) - Clock signal for sequential logic, positive edge triggered.
- Input: `a` (1 bit) - First operand for XOR operation.
- Input: `b` (1 bit) - Second operand for XOR operation.
- Output: `out_assign` (1 bit) - Result of XOR using an assign statement.
- Output: `out_always_comb` (1 bit) - Result of XOR using a combinational always block.
- Output: `out_always_ff` (1 bit) - Result of XOR using a sequential always block, delayed by one clock cycle.

Functional Description:
1. **XOR using `assign` Statement**:
   - The output `out_assign` is directly assigned the bitwise XOR of inputs `a` and `b` using the assign statement.
   - This is a combinational logic implementation.

2. **XOR using Combinational `always` Block**:
   - The output `out_always_comb` is computed within an `always @(*)` block.
   - This block evaluates whenever there is a change in the inputs `a` or `b`, ensuring combinational logic behavior.

3. **XOR using Sequential `always` Block**:
   - The output `out_always_ff` is updated within an `always @(posedge clk)` block.
   - A flip-flop is used, so the XOR result of inputs `a` and `b` is stored in a register and the output is delayed by one clock cycle.
   - Ensure the initial state of the register holding `out_always_ff` is defined as '0' upon reset.

General Guidelines:
- The module assumes all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
- No reset signal is specified; hence, ensure initial conditions are handled appropriately in simulation and synthesis.
- Ensure that no race conditions exist between the combinational and sequential blocks.
- All outputs must be defined for all possible input conditions to avoid latches or undefined behavior.
