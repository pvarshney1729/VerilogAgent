Module Specification: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `a`: Input vector, 5 bits wide (bit[4:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `b`: Input vector, 5 bits wide (bit[4:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `c`: Input vector, 5 bits wide (bit[4:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `d`: Input vector, 5 bits wide (bit[4:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `e`: Input vector, 5 bits wide (bit[4:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `f`: Input vector, 5 bits wide (bit[4:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)

- Outputs:
  - `w`: Output vector, 8 bits wide (bit[7:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `x`: Output vector, 8 bits wide (bit[7:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `y`: Output vector, 8 bits wide (bit[7:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)
  - `z`: Output vector, 8 bits wide (bit[7:0] with bit[0] as the least significant bit)

Functional Description:
- The module concatenates the six 5-bit input vectors, resulting in a 30-bit intermediate vector.
- The two least significant bits of the output vectors should be set to '1'.
- The 32-bit output vector is constructed by appending two '1' bits to the least significant end of the 30-bit concatenated input vector.
- The 32-bit output vector is then divided into four 8-bit output vectors, named `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- The output mapping is as follows:
  - `w` receives bits[31:24] of the 32-bit vector.
  - `x` receives bits[23:16] of the 32-bit vector.
  - `y` receives bits[15:8] of the 32-bit vector.
  - `z` receives bits[7:0] of the 32-bit vector.

Additional Notes:
- The concatenation and mapping are purely combinational logic, with no sequential elements involved.
- No reset or clock signals are necessary as the logic is fully combinational.
- Ensure the correct bit order is maintained during concatenation and splitting to avoid misalignment of data.
