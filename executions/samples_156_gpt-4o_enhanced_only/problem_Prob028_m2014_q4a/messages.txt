When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire d`: 1-bit data input.\n  - `input wire ena`: 1-bit enable signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg q`: 1-bit data output.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a D latch. The D latch is a level-sensitive latch that stores the input data `d` when the enable signal `ena` is active (logic high). The output `q` should reflect the input `d` when `ena` is high. When `ena` is low, the output `q` retains its previous state.\n\nSignal Conventions and Logic:\n- The input `d` and `ena` are 1-bit signals.\n- The output `q` is a 1-bit registered signal.\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n\nLatch Logic:\n- This is a combinational logic block implemented using an `always` block sensitive to changes in `d` or `ena`.\n- If `ena` is high (`ena == 1`), then `q` will be assigned the value of `d`.\n- If `ena` is low (`ena == 0`), `q` retains its previous state.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- The module does not specify behavior for asynchronous reset or set conditions.\n- The initial state of `q` is not explicitly defined and should be considered as unknown until an enable condition occurs.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure there are no race conditions by correctly using the enable signal and managing signal dependencies within the always block.\n                    "
