Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire d`: 1-bit data input.
  - `input wire ena`: 1-bit enable signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg q`: 1-bit data output.

Functional Description:
The module implements a D latch. The D latch is a level-sensitive latch that stores the input data `d` when the enable signal `ena` is active (logic high). The output `q` should reflect the input `d` when `ena` is high. When `ena` is low, the output `q` retains its previous state.

Signal Conventions and Logic:
- The input `d` and `ena` are 1-bit signals.
- The output `q` is a 1-bit registered signal.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.

Latch Logic:
- This is a combinational logic block implemented using an `always` block sensitive to changes in `d` or `ena`.
- If `ena` is high (`ena == 1`), then `q` will be assigned the value of `d`.
- If `ena` is low (`ena == 0`), `q` retains its previous state.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- The module does not specify behavior for asynchronous reset or set conditions.
- The initial state of `q` is not explicitly defined and should be considered as unknown until an enable condition occurs.

Note:
- Ensure there are no race conditions by correctly using the enable signal and managing signal dependencies within the always block.
