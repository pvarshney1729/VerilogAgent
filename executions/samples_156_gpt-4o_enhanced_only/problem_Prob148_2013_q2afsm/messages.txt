        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  resetn\n - input  r (3 bits)\n - output g (3 bits)\n\nThe module should implement the FSM described by the state diagram shown\nbelow:\n\n  A        --r0=0,r1=0,r2=0--> A\n  A        -------r0=1-------> B\n  A        -----r0=0,r1=1----> C\n  A        --r0=0,r1=0,r2=0--> D\n  B (g0=1) -------r0=1-------> B\n  B (g0=1) -------r0=0-------> A\n  C (g1=1) -------r1=1-------> C\n  C (g1=1) -------r1=0-------> A\n\nResetn is an active-low synchronous reset that resets into state A. This\nFSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of\nresource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for\nthe resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either\n_r[0]_, _r[1]_, or _r[2]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and\nrepresents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long\nas there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM\ndecides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to\na state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an\noutput from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 0 has a\nhigher priority than device 1, and device 2 has the lowest priority.\nHence, for example, device 2 will only receive a grant if it is the only\ndevice making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_,\nis given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant\nas long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\nImplement a module that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks\nfor the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures.\nDescribe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment\nstatement(s) or an always block (at your discretion). Assign any state\ncodes that you wish to use. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on\nthe positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.\n- `input wire resetn`: Active-low synchronous reset signal. Upon reset, the FSM enters state A.\n- `input wire [2:0] r`: Request signals from three devices, where `r[0]` is the most significant bit and `r[2]` is the least significant bit. Each bit `r[i]` is a request from device `i`.\n- `output reg [2:0] g`: Grant signals to three devices, where `g[0]` is the most significant bit and `g[2]` is the least significant bit. Each bit `g[i]` is a grant for device `i`.\n\nState Definitions:\n- State A: Initial state, no grants are active.\n- State B: Device 0 is granted access (g0 = 1).\n- State C: Device 1 is granted access (g1 = 1).\n- State D: Device 2 is granted access (g2 = 1).\n\nState Transition and Priority Logic:\n- From State A:\n  - If `r[0] == 1`, transition to State B (highest priority).\n  - Else if `r[1] == 1`, transition to State C.\n  - Else if `r[2] == 1`, transition to State D.\n  - Else remain in State A.\n- From State B:\n  - If `r[0] == 1`, remain in State B.\n  - Else transition back to State A.\n- From State C:\n  - If `r[1] == 1`, remain in State C.\n  - Else transition back to State A.\n- State D is not explicitly defined in the transitions since priority logic prevents entering State D when other higher-priority requests are present.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- `g[0] = 1` when in State B; otherwise, `g[0] = 0`.\n- `g[1] = 1` when in State C; otherwise, `g[1] = 0`.\n- `g[2] = 1` when in State D; otherwise, `g[2] = 0`.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On the assertion of `resetn` (active low), the FSM transitions to State A.\n- All `g[i]` outputs are set to 0 upon reset.\n\nImplementation Guidelines:\n- Use separate always blocks for state transition (state table) and state holding (state flip-flops).\n- Use descriptive state encoding as needed for clarity.\n- Ensure that all state transitions are driven by the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- All sequential elements should have explicitly defined initial values.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If multiple requests are present simultaneously while in State A, the highest priority request (`r[0]`) is granted.\n- State D can only be entered if `r[2] == 1` and `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 0`.\n\nConsider these specifications to maintain clarity and correctness in your implementation of the module.\n                    "
