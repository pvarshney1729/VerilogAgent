Module Name: TopModule

Interface Details:
- Inputs:
  - `input [7:0] a` : 8-bit unsigned integer input.
  - `input [7:0] b` : 8-bit unsigned integer input.
  - `input [7:0] c` : 8-bit unsigned integer input.
  - `input [7:0] d` : 8-bit unsigned integer input.

- Outputs:
  - `output [7:0] min` : 8-bit unsigned integer output, representing the minimum value among the inputs.

Functional Description:
- The module calculates the minimum value among the four 8-bit unsigned input values (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).
- The comparison between inputs should be performed using standard unsigned comparison operators (e.g., `a < b`).
- The module's logic is purely combinational; it does not involve any clocked or sequential elements.
- Ensure that the output `min` accurately reflects the smallest of the input values at all times.

Additional Considerations:
- There are no dependencies on external clock or reset signals, as this module is purely combinational.
- The bit index convention follows: `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `bit[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB).
- Handle all input combinations correctly, including edge cases where all inputs are equal.
