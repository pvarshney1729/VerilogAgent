Certainly! Here's the implementation of the `TopModule` which finds the minimum value among the four 8-bit inputs:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    input  [7:0] c,
    input  [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] min
);

    // Declare internal signals to hold intermediate minimum values
    logic [7:0] min_ab;
    logic [7:0] min_cd;

    // Combinational logic to determine the minimum of a and b
    always @(*) begin
        if (a < b) 
            min_ab = a;
        else 
            min_ab = b;
    end

    // Combinational logic to determine the minimum of c and d
    always @(*) begin
        if (c < d) 
            min_cd = c;
        else 
            min_cd = d;
    end

    // Combinational logic to find the overall minimum of min_ab and min_cd
    always @(*) begin
        if (min_ab < min_cd) 
            min = min_ab;
        else 
            min = min_cd;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses combinational logic to determine the minimum of two pairs of inputs and then finds the overall minimum between the two resulting values. The `always @(*)` blocks ensure that the logic is evaluated whenever the inputs change, making the output `min` always reflect the smallest input value.
