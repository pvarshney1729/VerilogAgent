Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The module "TopModule" is a combinational logic circuit. It takes four single-bit inputs and produces a single-bit output. The output is determined by specific combinations of the input values, as illustrated in the truth table below.

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - input wire a; // Single-bit input
  - input wire b; // Single-bit input
  - input wire c; // Single-bit input
  - input wire d; // Single-bit input

- Output:
  - output wire q; // Single-bit output

Input and Output Conventions:
- All inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) and the output (`q`) are single-bit signals.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Logic Specification:
The circuit is purely combinational, with the output `q` being a direct function of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` according to the following truth table:

|  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  q  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  0  |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |

Edge Cases and Implementation Notes:
- The table specifies all 16 possible combinations of the single-bit inputs.
- Ensure the logic is implemented to handle any changes at the inputs without requiring a clock signal, as this is strictly a combinational logic circuit.
- There are no sequential elements, reset conditions, or initial states required for this module.
- The priority of operations is determined directly by the truth table, and there are no race conditions due to the combinational nature of the circuit.
