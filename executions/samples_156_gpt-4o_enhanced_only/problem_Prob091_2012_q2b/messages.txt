All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  y (6 bits)\n - input  w\n - output Y1\n - output Y3\n\nConsider the following finite-state machine:\n\n  A (0) --1--> B\n  A (0) --0--> A\n  B (0) --1--> C\n  B (0) --0--> D\n  C (0) --1--> E\n  C (0) --0--> D\n  D (0) --1--> F\n  D (0) --0--> A\n  E (1) --1--> E\n  E (1) --0--> D\n  F (1) --1--> C\n  F (1) --0--> D\n\nAssume that a one-hot code is used with the state assignment y[5:0] =\n000001(A), 000010(B), 000100(C), 001000(D), 010000(E), 100000(F)\n\nThe module should implement the state output logic for this finite-state\nmachine. The output signal Y1 should be the input of state flip-flop\ny[1]. The output signal Y3 should be the input of state flip-flop y[3].\nDerive the implementation by inspection assuming the above one-hot\nencoding.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\n- Inputs:\n  - `y`: A 6-bit input vector representing the current state of the finite-state machine using one-hot encoding. Bit index 5 is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit index 0 is the least significant bit (LSB).\n  - `w`: A 1-bit input signal.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `Y1`: A 1-bit output signal representing the next state condition for flip-flop corresponding to state B (`y[1]`).\n  - `Y3`: A 1-bit output signal representing the next state condition for flip-flop corresponding to state D (`y[3]`).\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- States are encoded in one-hot format as follows:\n  - A: `y[5:0] = 000001`\n  - B: `y[5:0] = 000010`\n  - C: `y[5:0] = 000100`\n  - D: `y[5:0] = 001000`\n  - E: `y[5:0] = 010000`\n  - F: `y[5:0] = 100000`\n\n- State Transitions:\n  - From State A (`y[0] = 1`):\n    - On `w = 1`: Transition to State B (`y[1]`).\n    - On `w = 0`: Remain in State A.\n  - From State B (`y[1] = 1`):\n    - On `w = 1`: Transition to State C (`y[2]`).\n    - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D (`y[3]`).\n  - From State C (`y[2] = 1`):\n    - On `w = 1`: Transition to State E (`y[4]`).\n    - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D (`y[3]`).\n  - From State D (`y[3] = 1`):\n    - On `w = 1`: Transition to State F (`y[5]`).\n    - On `w = 0`: Transition to State A (`y[0]`).\n  - From State E (`y[4] = 1`):\n    - On `w = 1`: Remain in State E.\n    - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D (`y[3]`).\n  - From State F (`y[5] = 1`):\n    - On `w = 1`: Transition to State C (`y[2]`).\n    - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D (`y[3]`).\n\nOutput Logic:\n- `Y1` should be high (`1`) if the next state should be B (`y[1]` is to be set).\n- `Y3` should be high (`1`) if the next state should be D (`y[3]` is to be set).\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The FSM follows a one-hot encoding scheme, so only one bit in the `y` vector is high at any time.\n- Ensure that transitions and state outputs are evaluated on each clock cycle.\n- No explicit reset behavior is defined in the original specification; consult with the system architect if a reset condition is required.\n                    "
