Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input  wire clk: Clock signal for the module. It is a single bit.
- input  wire reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal. It is a single bit that resets the state machine to the OFF state.
- input  wire j: Input signal that influences state transitions. It is a single bit.
- input  wire k: Input signal that influences state transitions. It is a single bit.
- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state output. It is a single bit.

State Machine Specifications:
- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- The state machine transitions are determined by inputs j and k as follows:
  - OFF (state): 
    - Output 'out' is 0.
    - Transition to ON when j = 1.
    - Remain in OFF when j = 0.
  - ON (state):
    - Output 'out' is 1.
    - Transition to OFF when k = 1.
    - Remain in ON when k = 0.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is a synchronous reset that occurs on the rising edge of 'clk'.
- When 'reset' is asserted high, the state machine transitions to the OFF state, and 'out' is set to 0.

Clock Cycle and Sequential Logic:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of 'clk'.
- The output 'out' is updated based on the current state at each rising edge of 'clk'.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon initialization, or when reset is activated, the state machine starts in the OFF state with 'out' = 0.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All signals are single-bit width.
- No specific MSB/LSB or bit indexing applies beyond single-bit interpretation.

Edge Cases:
- The state machine does not handle simultaneous assertions of j and k. The behavior is determined by the current state and the active edge of the clock.
- Ensure the clock period accommodates the setup and hold times for the synchronous reset signal.
