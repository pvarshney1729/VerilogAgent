Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` implementing the specified Moore state machine with a synchronous reset.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    input logic j,
    input logic k,
    output logic out
);

    // Define state encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        OFF = 2'b00,
        ON  = 2'b01
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            OFF: begin
                if (j)
                    next_state = ON;
                else
                    next_state = OFF;
            end
            ON: begin
                if (k)
                    next_state = OFF;
                else
                    next_state = ON;
            end
            default: next_state = OFF;
        endcase
    end

    // State register logic with synchronous reset
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= OFF;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Output logic based on the state
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            OFF: out = 1'b0;
            ON:  out = 1'b1;
            default: out = 1'b0;
        endcase
    end

This implementation uses an enumerated type to encode the states, ensuring clarity and maintainability. The state transition logic is managed within a combinational `always` block, while the state register logic, including the synchronous reset, is handled in a sequential `always_ff` block. The output `out` is determined by the current state, consistent with the Moore machine definition.
