Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic a` : Single-bit input signal.
  - `input logic b` : Single-bit input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - `output logic q` : Single-bit output signal.

Operational Characteristics:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The output `q` is determined by the truth table derived from the simulation waveforms.

Truth Table:
- The output `q` is defined by the following conditions based on inputs `a` and `b`:

  | a | b | q |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- The circuit should be designed to meet the truth table without any sequential elements or storage.

Additional Notes:
- All signals are active-high.
- Ensure that the logic is implemented purely combinationally, with no dependencies on clock edges or storage elements.
- The output `q` reflects the direct logical computation from the inputs `a` and `b` with no delays or asynchronous behavior.
