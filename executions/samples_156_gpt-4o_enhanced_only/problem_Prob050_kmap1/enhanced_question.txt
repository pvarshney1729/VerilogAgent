Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input a`: 1-bit signal.
  - `input b`: 1-bit signal.
  - `input c`: 1-bit signal.
- Output Ports:
  - `output out`: 1-bit signal.

Port Naming and Conventions:
- All ports are active high and unsigned.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Circuit Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The output `out` is determined by the Karnaugh map provided.

Karnaugh Map:
- The map is defined with `a` as the column variable and `bc` as the row variables.
- The truth table derived from the Karnaugh map is as follows:

          a
   bc   0   1
   00 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 1 |
   11 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 |

Truth Table:
- Given inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output `out` is determined as follows:
  - When `bc = 00` and `a = 0`, `out` = 0.
  - For all other cases, `out` = 1.

Additional Notes:
- No sequential logic elements or clock signals are involved in this implementation.
- The module does not require a reset signal, as it is purely combinational.
- Ensure no race conditions exist since the logic is combinational.
- The logic should be optimized for minimal gate usage while maintaining the specified behavior.
