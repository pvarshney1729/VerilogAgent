Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal for synchronizing state transitions.
  - `input wire areset` : Active-high asynchronous reset signal.
  - `input wire j` : Input signal that influences state transitions.
  - `input wire k` : Input signal that influences state transitions.
- Output Ports:
  - `output reg out` : Output signal representing the current state output.

Port and Signal Details:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.
- The output `out` is a registered output reflecting the state of the Moore machine.

State Machine Description:
- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: `OFF` and `ON`.
- State `OFF` is represented by the binary state of 0, and state `ON` is represented by the binary state of 1.
- The output `out` is directly associated with the current state: 
  - `OFF` state produces `out = 0`
  - `ON` state produces `out = 1`

State Transition Logic:
- From state `OFF` (out=0):
  - If `j = 0`, remain in `OFF`.
  - If `j = 1`, transition to `ON`.
- From state `ON` (out=1):
  - If `k = 0`, remain in `ON`.
  - If `k = 1`, transition to `OFF`.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal `areset` is an active-high asynchronous reset.
- When `areset` is asserted high, the state machine transitions immediately to the `OFF` state, regardless of the clock signal.
- Upon reset, the output `out` is set to 0.

Clock and Timing:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal, except during an active asynchronous reset.

Initial Conditions:
- The initial state of the state machine is `OFF` with `out = 0` upon power-up or reset.

Signal Dependencies and Precedence:
- The transitions are determined by the inputs `j` and `k`, evaluated on the rising edge of `clk`.
- Asynchronous reset `areset` takes precedence over the clock-driven transitions.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure robustness by defining behavior under all possible input combinations.
- Maintain defined transition logic even during rapid changes in input signals `j` and `k`.
