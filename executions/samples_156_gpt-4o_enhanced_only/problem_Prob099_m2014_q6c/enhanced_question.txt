Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `y`: 6-bit input vector (bit[5] is the most significant bit, bit[0] is the least significant bit)
  - `w`: 1-bit input
- Output Ports:
  - `Y1`: 1-bit output
  - `Y3`: 1-bit output

State Machine Description:
- States: A, B, C, D, E, F
- State encoding (one-hot):
  - State A: y = 000001
  - State B: y = 000010
  - State C: y = 000100
  - State D: y = 001000
  - State E: y = 010000
  - State F: y = 100000

State Transitions:
- From State A:
  - Input w = 0: Transition to State B
  - Input w = 1: Remain in State A
- From State B:
  - Input w = 0: Transition to State C
  - Input w = 1: Transition to State D
- From State C:
  - Input w = 0: Transition to State E
  - Input w = 1: Transition to State D
- From State D:
  - Input w = 0: Transition to State F
  - Input w = 1: Transition to State A
- From State E:
  - Input w = 0: Remain in State E
  - Input w = 1: Transition to State D
- From State F:
  - Input w = 0: Transition to State C
  - Input w = 1: Transition to State D

Reset Behavior:
- The state machine resets asynchronously to State A (y = 000001).

Output Logic:
- `Y1` is derived from the current state and indicates the output associated with that state.
- `Y3` is derived similarly. The specification does not provide explicit logic for these outputs; they depend on the derived logic equations.

Next-State Logic:
- The next-state signals `Y2` and `Y4` correspond to y[1] and y[3] respectively.
- Derive logic equations for `Y2` and `Y4` using inspection based on one-hot encoding and state transitions.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the state machine initializes to State A with y = 000001.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure proper handling of invalid states by resetting or ignoring transitions from undefined states.
- The behavior for `Y1` and `Y3` outputs during invalid states should default to a safe state, typically zero.

Note: This specification assumes that all operations are edge-triggered on the rising edge of a clock signal, which is not explicitly mentioned here. Ensure this in the implementation.
