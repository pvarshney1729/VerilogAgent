Let's implement the `TopModule` with the specified functionality. We'll create a state machine to handle the pattern detection, delay capture, counting process, and acknowledgment. Here's the Verilog code:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    input logic data,
    input logic ack,
    output logic [3:0] count,
    output logic counting,
    output logic done
);

    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        IDLE,
        PATTERN_DETECT,
        CAPTURE_DELAY,
        COUNTDOWN,
        WAIT_ACK
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    logic [3:0] delay, delay_counter;
    logic [9:0] cycle_counter; // To count up to 1000 cycles

    // Sequential logic for state transitions and output logic
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
            delay <= 4'b0;
            delay_counter <= 4'b0;
            cycle_counter <= 10'b0;
            count <= 4'b0;
            counting <= 1'b0;
            done <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;

            case (current_state)
                PATTERN_DETECT: begin
                    // Shift in the delay value once the pattern is detected
                    delay <= {delay[2:0], data};
                end
                CAPTURE_DELAY: begin
                    delay_counter <= delay;
                    cycle_counter <= 10'b0;
                end

                        if (delay_counter != 4'b0) begin
                            delay_counter <= delay_counter - 1;
                        end
                    end else begin
                        cycle_counter <= cycle_counter + 1;
                    end
                    count <= delay_counter;
                end
                WAIT_ACK: begin
                    done <= 1'b1;

            endcase

    always_comb begin
        next_state = current_state;
        counting = 1'b0;
        done = 1'b0;

            IDLE: begin
                if (data == 1'b1) begin
                    next_state = PATTERN_DETECT;
                end
            end
            PATTERN_DETECT: begin
                if (&{delay[2:0], data}) begin // Pattern 1101 detected
                    next_state = CAPTURE_DELAY;
                end
            end
            CAPTURE_DELAY: begin
                next_state = COUNTDOWN;

This code includes:
- A state machine with states for pattern detection, delay capture, counting, and waiting for acknowledgment.
- A synchronous reset to initialize the state and all necessary registers.
- Cycle counting logic to handle the required delay of `(delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000` clock cycles.
- Outputs `count`, `counting`, and `done` are controlled based on the current state and cycle counts.
