Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous active-high reset signal.
  - `input x`: 1-bit input signal to the Mealy FSM.
- Output Ports:
  - `output z`: 1-bit output signal from the Mealy FSM.

Functional Description:
The module implements a Mealy finite-state machine (FSM) that performs a 2's complement operation on the input `x` using one-hot encoding. The FSM consists of two states, A and B, and transitions between these states based on the input `x` as follows:

State Transitions and Output Logic:
- State A:
  - `x=0`: Remain in State A, output `z=0`.
  - `x=1`: Transition to State B, output `z=1`.
- State B:
  - `x=0`: Remain in State B, output `z=1`.
  - `x=1`: Remain in State B, output `z=0`.

Encoding:
- One-hot encoding is used for state representation:
  - State A: (1, 0)
  - State B: (0, 1)

Reset Behavior:
- On an asynchronous active-high reset (`areset`), the FSM initializes to State A, where the output `z` is `0`.

Signal and Logic Details:
- All state transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).
- The reset (`areset`) takes precedence over state transitions and is asynchronous. If `areset` is high, the FSM immediately resets to State A regardless of the clock.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- Ensure that the FSM correctly handles rapid changes in `x` and `areset` signals without causing erroneous state transitions or outputs.
- All state transitions and output assignments are to be evaluated in a single clock cycle, reflecting the Mealy machine's characteristic of output depending on current state and input.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up or reset, the FSM is guaranteed to be in State A with `z` set to `0`.
