When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.\n  - `input areset`: Asynchronous active-high reset signal.\n  - `input x`: 1-bit input signal to the Mealy FSM.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output z`: 1-bit output signal from the Mealy FSM.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Mealy finite-state machine (FSM) that performs a 2's complement operation on the input `x` using one-hot encoding. The FSM consists of two states, A and B, and transitions between these states based on the input `x` as follows:\n\nState Transitions and Output Logic:\n- State A:\n  - `x=0`: Remain in State A, output `z=0`.\n  - `x=1`: Transition to State B, output `z=1`.\n- State B:\n  - `x=0`: Remain in State B, output `z=1`.\n  - `x=1`: Remain in State B, output `z=0`.\n\nEncoding:\n- One-hot encoding is used for state representation:\n  - State A: (1, 0)\n  - State B: (0, 1)\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On an asynchronous active-high reset (`areset`), the FSM initializes to State A, where the output `z` is `0`.\n\nSignal and Logic Details:\n- All state transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n- The reset (`areset`) takes precedence over state transitions and is asynchronous. If `areset` is high, the FSM immediately resets to State A regardless of the clock.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- Ensure that the FSM correctly handles rapid changes in `x` and `areset` signals without causing erroneous state transitions or outputs.\n- All state transitions and output assignments are to be evaluated in a single clock cycle, reflecting the Mealy machine's characteristic of output depending on current state and input.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On power-up or reset, the FSM is guaranteed to be in State A with `z` set to `0`.\n                    "
