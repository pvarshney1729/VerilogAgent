Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements a D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset. The module adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions you provided:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic ar,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge ar) begin
        if (ar) begin
            q <= 1'b0; // Asynchronous reset, set q to 0
        end else begin
            q <= d; // Capture the value of d on the rising edge of clk
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has the specified input and output ports, all declared as `logic`.
- **always_ff Block**: Utilizes an `always_ff` block, which is a SystemVerilog construct that is functionally similar to `always` but explicitly indicates the block is for sequential logic.
- **Sensitivity List**: Includes both `posedge clk` and `posedge ar` to handle the asynchronous reset.
- **Reset Logic**: Checks for the reset condition first (`if (ar)`), ensuring the output `q` is immediately reset to `0` whenever `ar` is asserted.
- **Data Capture**: If the reset is not active, the flip-flop captures the value of `d` on the rising edge of the clock.
