When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, is defined with the following interface. All input and output ports are single-bit signals unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input wire clk`: The clock signal. The `D` flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of this clock signal.\n- `input wire ar`: An asynchronous reset signal. When asserted (`ar = 1`), this signal will reset the flip-flop output `q` to its initial state immediately, regardless of the clock.\n- `input wire d`: The data input for the `D` flip-flop.\n- `output reg q`: The output of the `D` flip-flop, which holds the data.\n\nSpecifications for the behavior and implementation of the `D` flip-flop:\n\n1. **Positive Edge Triggered**: The `D` flip-flop captures the value of the data input `d` on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`), provided the asynchronous reset (`ar`) is not asserted.\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset signal `ar` is active-high. When `ar` is high (`1`), the output `q` is reset to `0` immediately, overriding any clock or data signals. This reset is asynchronous, meaning it does not wait for the clock edge to occur.\n\n3. **Initial State**: On power-up or initialization, the output `q` should be considered undefined until a reset operation occurs or the first clock edge with valid data is captured.\n\n4. **Output Update**: \n   - If `ar` is low (`0`), on the rising edge of `clk`, the output `q` will update to the value of the input `d`.\n   - If `ar` is high (`1`), the output `q` will be set to `0` regardless of the clock or data input.\n\n5. **Signal Dependencies**: The precedence of operations is such that the asynchronous reset `ar` has the highest priority, overriding all other operations.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that any changes in the signal `d` are only captured on the positive edge of `clk` when `ar` is not asserted. Any spurious signals on `d` outside of these conditions should not affect `q`.\n\nThis description ensures that the flip-flop operates correctly under all specified conditions, providing a reliable output based on input signals and reset conditions.\n                    "
