Module Specification: TopModule

1. Module Interface:
   - Output: 
     - `out`: 1-bit wide, logic output (bit[0] is the least significant bit).
   
2. Functional Description:
   - The module `TopModule` should continuously drive the output `out` to logic '0' (logic low). This is a combinational logic operation, meaning the output is not dependent on any clock signal or sequential logic.

3. Implementation Details:
   - The output `out` is intended to be a constant logic '0', ensuring it always provides a stable and predictable value regardless of any input or external conditions.

4. Additional Considerations:
   - As this module has no inputs or sequential elements, there are no dependencies on clock edges, resets, or other timing-related signals.
   - There are no edge cases or input boundaries to consider, as the module's behavior is entirely defined by its combinational logic nature.
