Here is the implementation of the `TopModule` with the specified interface and behavior, including the use of D flip-flops triggered by the positive edge of the clock:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] d,
    output logic [7:0] q
);

    // Sequential logic for D flip-flops
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation
- **Ports Declaration**: The module has been defined with an 8-bit input `d` and an 8-bit output `q`, along with a 1-bit clock input `clk`.
- **Sequential Logic**: The `always_ff` block is used to describe synchronous behavior on the positive edge of `clk`. The `always_ff` construct is preferred for clarity when describing flip-flops.
- **Data Transfer**: On each positive edge of the clock, the data from `d` is transferred to `q`, effectively implementing 8 D flip-flops.
- **Initialization**: The output `q` will automatically be initialized to zero upon simulation start due to the use of `logic` data types, which default to an unknown state ('x') that gets resolved to '0' in zero-time simulation for practical purposes.

This code adheres to the specified guidelines and conventions, ensuring correct operation of the module.
