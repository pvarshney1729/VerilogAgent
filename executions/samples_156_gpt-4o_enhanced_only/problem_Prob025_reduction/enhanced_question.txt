Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `in`: 8-bit wide input vector. Bit `in[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and `in[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `parity`: 1-bit wide output that represents the computed parity bit.

Functional Description:
The purpose of the TopModule is to compute an even parity bit for an 8-bit input vector `in`. The even parity bit is calculated as the XOR of all 8 bits of the input vector. When the XOR of all bits is 0, the output parity bit should be 0, indicating that the number of 1-bits is even. Conversely, if the XOR result is 1, the output parity bit should be 1, indicating that the number of 1-bits is odd.

Operational Details:
- The module is purely combinational. No clock or reset signals are involved as there are no sequential elements or stateful behavior.
- The output `parity` is updated immediately in response to any change in the input vector `in`.

Boundary Conditions:
- The module does not handle cases beyond the 8-bit input size specified and assumes that the input vector `in` is always a valid 8-bit binary number.
