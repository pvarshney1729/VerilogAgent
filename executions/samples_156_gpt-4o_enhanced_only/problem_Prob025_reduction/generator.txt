Generated Response:

Based on the specifications provided, here is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog. This module computes the even parity bit for an 8-bit input vector by using the XOR operation on all the input bits:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [7:0] in,     // 8-bit input vector
    output logic parity       // Output parity bit
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Compute the even parity bit as the XOR of all input bits
        parity = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3] ^ in[4] ^ in[5] ^ in[6] ^ in[7];
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Key Points:
- **Input Declaration**: The input `in` is declared as an 8-bit wide vector using `logic [7:0]`.
- **Output Declaration**: The output `parity` is declared as a single-bit logic.
- **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block is used to handle the combinational logic without specifying the sensitivity list explicitly. This ensures that the block is executed whenever there is a change in any of the input bits.
- **XOR Operation**: The parity bit is calculated by XOR-ing all the bits of the input vector `in`. This results in an even parity bit, where the parity bit is 0 if the number of 1s is even, and 1 if the number of 1s is odd.

);

    always @(*) begin
        // Compute the even parity bit as the XOR of all input bits
        parity = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3] ^ in[4] ^ in[5] ^ in[6] ^ in[7];
