Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` which performs positive edge detection on each bit of the 8-bit input vector `in`. The module captures a positive edge transition from 0 to 1 and reflects it in the output `pedge`.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] pedge
);

    // Internal register to hold the previous state of the input
    logic [7:0] prev_in;

    // Sequential logic to detect positive edges
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        // Iterate over each bit to detect positive edge
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
            // Check for 0 to 1 transition for each bit
            pedge[i] <= ~prev_in[i] & in[i];
        end
        // Update the previous input to the current input
        prev_in <= in;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Internal Register (`prev_in`)**: This register stores the input value from the previous clock cycle. It is used to compare against the current input to detect positive edges.

2. **Positive Edge Detection**: 
   - The module uses a `for` loop to iterate over each bit of the input vector `in`.
   - For each bit, a positive edge is detected by checking if the bit was 0 in the previous cycle (`~prev_in[i]`) and is now 1 in the current cycle (`in[i]`).

3. **Sequential Logic**:
   - The `always_ff @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the edge detection and state updates occur synchronously with the clock.
   - The `<=` operator is used for non-blocking assignments to ensure proper timing behavior.

4. **No Reset Signal**:
   - The implementation does not include a reset signal since it wasn't initially specified in your question. If required, an additional input for `reset` can be added to initialize `prev_in` and `pedge` to zero during reset.

This module meets the functional requirements as specified, ensuring that it detects a positive edge correctly for each bit in the input vector.
