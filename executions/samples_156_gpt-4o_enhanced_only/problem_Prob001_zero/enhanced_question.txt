Module Name: TopModule

Port Description:
- Output:
  - zero: 1-bit output, always driven LOW (logic 0).

Functional Specification:
- The module TopModule is a combinational logic circuit.
- The output port 'zero' is a constant signal that consistently outputs a logic LOW value.
- Since the output does not depend on any input signals, no input ports are required.

Implementation Notes:
- As the module is purely combinational, there are no clock or reset signals involved.
- The output 'zero' should be hardwired to logic 0, ensuring that regardless of any internal or external conditions, the output remains unaffected.
- Ensure that the implementation correctly reflects a permanently LOW signal, with no unintended toggling or race conditions.

Edge Cases:
- Since the output is constant and independent of any input, there are no edge cases or boundaries to consider in this design.
