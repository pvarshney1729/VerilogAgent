Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active-high. Resets the counter.
  - `input train_valid`: Indicates when the training operation is valid.
  - `input train_taken`: Indicates the outcome of the training operation.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `output [1:0] state`: Two-bit output representing the current state of the saturating counter. Bit[1] is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
- This module implements a two-bit saturating counter with the following behavior:
  - The counter value is incremented by 1 (up to a maximum of 2'b11) when both `train_valid` and `train_taken` are asserted ('1').
  - The counter value is decremented by 1 (down to a minimum of 2'b00) when `train_valid` is asserted ('1') and `train_taken` is deasserted ('0').
  - If `train_valid` is deasserted ('0'), the counter retains its current value regardless of `train_taken`.

Reset Behavior:
- `areset` is an asynchronous reset. When asserted ('1'), it immediately resets the counter to the state 2'b01, representing "weakly not-taken," regardless of the clock signal.

Clocking:
- All sequential logic, including the counter updates, is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

Initial State:
- Upon power-up or reset (via `areset`), the counter initializes to the state 2'b01.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- The counter saturates at the boundaries: it does not increment past 2'b11 or decrement below 2'b00.
- Ensure no race conditions occur between the asynchronous reset and the clock-driven logic.

Note:
- The specification assumes that the behavior of the module does not depend on any external conditions beyond the defined input signals.
