<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit input, serves as the clock signal for triggering sequential logic. The positive edge is the active edge.
  - `d`: 1-bit input, the data input to the flip-flop.
- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 1-bit output, represents the state of the flip-flop.

Functionality:
- The module implements a single D flip-flop.
- The flip-flop captures the value of `d` on the rising edge of `clk`.
- The output `q` reflects the value of `d` as captured at the last rising edge of `clk`.

Initial Conditions:
- By default, assume `q` initializes to 0 at reset.

Clock and Reset:
- Reset behavior should be defined as required, though none is specified here. If a reset is to be implemented, specify whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and its effect on `q`.

Bit Conventions:
- All signals are 1-bit wide, with no specific signedness applicable.

Notes:
- Ensure that no race conditions exist between the input `d` and the clock `clk`.

Behavior:
- On each rising edge of `clk`, `q` is updated to reflect `d`.
- If any reset is added, explicitly define its behavior and priority over the clock edge-triggered behavior.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that input `d` is stable around the clock edge to avoid metastability.
