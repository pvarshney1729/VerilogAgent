Based on your requirements, I'll implement the `TopModule` with a single D flip-flop. Since no reset functionality is specified, the module will focus on capturing the input `d` on the rising edge of `clk` and reflecting this on the output `q`.

Here is the Verilog implementation:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);
    // Sequential logic to implement a D flip-flop
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d; // On every positive edge of clock, update q with d
    end
endmodule
[DONE]

This module adheres to the specified interface and performs the basic functionality of a D flip-flop. It uses the `always_ff` block, which is a synthesizable construct that ensures the block is executed only on the rising edge of the clock, making it suitable for flip-flop implementation.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);
    // Sequential logic to implement a D flip-flop
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d; // On every positive edge of clock, update q with d
    end
endmodule
