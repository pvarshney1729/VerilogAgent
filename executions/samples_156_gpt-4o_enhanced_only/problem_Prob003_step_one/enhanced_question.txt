<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Port:
  - Name: one
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Type: Combinational logic output

Functional Specification:
- The output port 'one' should always drive a constant logic high value ('1').

Design Considerations:
- Since this is purely combinational logic, there are no clock or reset signals involved.
- The module does not contain any sequential elements, hence there are no initial values or reset states to define.

Additional Notes:
- Output 'one' is continuously driven by a logical '1', ensuring a constant high signal at all times.
