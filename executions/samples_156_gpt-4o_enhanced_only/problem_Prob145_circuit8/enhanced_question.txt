Module Name: `TopModule`

Port Definitions:
- `input clock`: Clock signal for synchronization. Active on the rising edge.
- `input a`: Data input, 1-bit wide.
- `output reg p`: Output signal `p`, 1-bit wide, changes state based on input `a` and clock.
- `output reg q`: Output signal `q`, 1-bit wide, changes state based on input `a` and clock.

Signal and State Definitions:
- Initial states: 
  - `p` initializes to `0`.
  - `q` initializes to `0`.
- The state of `p` and `q` is updated on the rising edge of `clock`.

Behavioral Description:
1. **Clock Rising Edge**: 
   - If `a` is `1`, set `p` to `1` and leave `q` unchanged.
   - If `a` is `0`, set `p` to `0` and leave `q` unchanged.
   - Note: `p` changes on the rising edge of `clock` based on the current value of `a`.

2. **Clock Falling Edge**:
   - If `a` is `1`, set `q` to the current state of `p`.
   - If `a` is `0`, set `q` to `0`.

Timing Considerations:
- The initial state before any clock edges is `p = x` and `q = x` until the first rising edge of `clock`.
- The outputs `p` and `q` may take on undefined states (`x`) before the first rising edge of `clock` due to lack of initial clock edge events.

Edge Cases:
- At time `0ns`, both `p` and `q` are undefined, represented by `x`.
- The behavior of the circuit is defined for all combinations of `a` and `clock` after the first clock edge.

Reset Condition:
- No explicit reset is defined. Assume the initial state is based on power-up conditions as described above.

Design Assumptions:
- The circuit behavior is fully synchronous, and all transitions occur on clock edges.
- The input `a` is assumed to be stable shortly before the clock edge to avoid race conditions.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that all signals are sampled and updated correctly at the clock edges, respecting the behavior of sequential logic elements.
