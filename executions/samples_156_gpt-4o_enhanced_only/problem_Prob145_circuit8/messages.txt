When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input clock`: Clock signal for synchronization. Active on the rising edge.\n- `input a`: Data input, 1-bit wide.\n- `output reg p`: Output signal `p`, 1-bit wide, changes state based on input `a` and clock.\n- `output reg q`: Output signal `q`, 1-bit wide, changes state based on input `a` and clock.\n\nSignal and State Definitions:\n- Initial states: \n  - `p` initializes to `0`.\n  - `q` initializes to `0`.\n- The state of `p` and `q` is updated on the rising edge of `clock`.\n\nBehavioral Description:\n1. **Clock Rising Edge**: \n   - If `a` is `1`, set `p` to `1` and leave `q` unchanged.\n   - If `a` is `0`, set `p` to `0` and leave `q` unchanged.\n   - Note: `p` changes on the rising edge of `clock` based on the current value of `a`.\n\n2. **Clock Falling Edge**:\n   - If `a` is `1`, set `q` to the current state of `p`.\n   - If `a` is `0`, set `q` to `0`.\n\nTiming Considerations:\n- The initial state before any clock edges is `p = x` and `q = x` until the first rising edge of `clock`.\n- The outputs `p` and `q` may take on undefined states (`x`) before the first rising edge of `clock` due to lack of initial clock edge events.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- At time `0ns`, both `p` and `q` are undefined, represented by `x`.\n- The behavior of the circuit is defined for all combinations of `a` and `clock` after the first clock edge.\n\nReset Condition:\n- No explicit reset is defined. Assume the initial state is based on power-up conditions as described above.\n\nDesign Assumptions:\n- The circuit behavior is fully synchronous, and all transitions occur on clock edges.\n- The input `a` is assumed to be stable shortly before the clock edge to avoid race conditions.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that all signals are sampled and updated correctly at the clock edges, respecting the behavior of sequential logic elements.\n                    "
