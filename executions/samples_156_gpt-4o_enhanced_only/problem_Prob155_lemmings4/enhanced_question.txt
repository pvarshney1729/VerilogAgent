Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input  clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations, positive edge triggered.
- input  areset: Asynchronous reset, active high, resets the Lemming to the initial state.
- input  bump_left: Active high signal indicating an obstacle on the left.
- input  bump_right: Active high signal indicating an obstacle on the right.
- input  ground: Active high signal indicating ground is present under the Lemming.
- input  dig: Active high signal indicating the command to start digging.
- output walk_left: Active high signal indicating the Lemming is walking left.
- output walk_right: Active high signal indicating the Lemming is walking right.
- output aaah: Active high signal indicating the Lemming is falling.
- output digging: Active high signal indicating the Lemming is digging.

State Definitions:
- Walking Left: Lemming is moving left. Output walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0.
- Walking Right: Lemming is moving right. Output walk_right = 1, walk_left = 0.
- Falling: Lemming is falling. Output aaah = 1, walk_left = 0, walk_right = 0.
- Digging: Lemming is digging. Output digging = 1, walk_left = 0, walk_right = 0.

State Transitions:
- On areset: Reset the Lemming to Walking Left state.
- On bump_left = 1: Switch from Walking Left to Walking Right.
- On bump_right = 1: Switch from Walking Right to Walking Left.
- On ground = 0: Transition to Falling state regardless of bumps.
- On ground = 1 after falling: Resume the previous walking direction.
- On dig = 1 and ground = 1: Enter Digging state from Walking states.
- On ground = 0 while digging: Transition to Falling state.
- Falling for more than 20 clock cycles and hitting ground: Enter a terminal state where all outputs are 0.

Precedence of Operations:
1. Falling (ground = 0) has the highest precedence.
2. Digging (dig = 1 and ground = 1) has the second highest precedence.
3. Direction change (bump signals) has the lowest precedence.

Edge Cases:
- Simultaneous bump_left and bump_right: Change direction.
- Bump while falling or digging: No effect.
- Dig command while falling or no ground: Ignored.
- Falling cycle count resets upon hitting ground.

All state transitions and output evaluations occur at the positive edge of the clock.

Reset State:
- On areset: Lemming is in the Walking Left state with walk_left = 1, all other outputs = 0.

Note:
- The falling duration counter should reset upon hitting the ground or on areset.
- The system should ensure no race conditions exist between falling, digging, and direction changes.
