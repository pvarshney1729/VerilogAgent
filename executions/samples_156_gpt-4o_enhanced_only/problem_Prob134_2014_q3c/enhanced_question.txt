Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations (1-bit).
  - input wire x: Control input signal (1-bit).
  - input wire [2:0] y: Present state input signal (3-bit vector, with y[2] as the most significant bit (MSB) and y[0] as the least significant bit (LSB)).

- Output Ports:
  - output wire Y0: Output bit from the next state vector, specifically Y[0] (1-bit).
  - output wire z: Output signal based on the FSM state and transitions (1-bit).

FSM Description:
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following characteristics:
  - The FSM has a synchronous reset and is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal.
  - The present state is represented by a 3-bit vector y[2:0].
  - The next state, denoted as Y[2:0], is determined based on the current state y[2:0] and input x.
  
State Transition Table:
- Present state y[2:0] transitions to the next state Y[2:0] based on input x:
  - When y = 3'b000:
    - If x = 0, next state Y = 3'b000.
    - If x = 1, next state Y = 3'b001.
    - Output z = 0.
  - When y = 3'b001:
    - If x = 0, next state Y = 3'b001.
    - If x = 1, next state Y = 3'b100.
    - Output z = 0.
  - When y = 3'b010:
    - If x = 0, next state Y = 3'b010.
    - If x = 1, next state Y = 3'b001.
    - Output z = 0.
  - When y = 3'b011:
    - If x = 0, next state Y = 3'b001.
    - If x = 1, next state Y = 3'b010.
    - Output z = 1.
  - When y = 3'b100:
    - If x = 0, next state Y = 3'b011.
    - If x = 1, next state Y = 3'b100.
    - Output z = 1.

Outputs:
- The output Y0 is the least significant bit (LSB) of the next state vector Y[0].
- The output z is determined by the current state and is independent of input x, as described in the state transition table.

Initial Conditions:
- All registers and sequential elements should be initialized to a defined state. The initial state should be 3'b000 unless otherwise specified.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- Ensure that all transitions are appropriately defined for each state and input combination.
- Handle any undefined states transition to a safe state, preferably the initial state.

Clock and Reset:
- The module operates on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- Implement a synchronous reset mechanism to initialize the FSM to the defined initial state.
