All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - output ena (3 bits)\n - output q   (16 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a 4-digit BCD (binary-coded decimal) counter.\nEach decimal digit is encoded using 4 bits: q[3:0] is the ones digit,\nq[7:4] is the tens digit, etc. For digits [3:1], also output an enable\nsignal indicating when each of the upper three digits should be\nincremented. Include a synchronous active-high reset. Assume all\nsequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- input wire reset: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n- output reg [2:0] ena: 3-bit output indicating enable status for tens, hundreds, and thousands digits.\n- output reg [15:0] q: 16-bit output representing a 4-digit BCD counter.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 4-digit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) counter.\n- The BCD representation assigns 4 bits to each decimal digit:\n  - q[3:0] corresponds to the ones digit.\n  - q[7:4] corresponds to the tens digit.\n  - q[11:8] corresponds to the hundreds digit.\n  - q[15:12] corresponds to the thousands digit.\n\n- The output enable signal 'ena' indicates when an increment should occur for the tens, hundreds, and thousands digits:\n  - ena[0] aligns with the tens digit (q[7:4]).\n  - ena[1] aligns with the hundreds digit (q[11:8]).\n  - ena[2] aligns with the thousands digit (q[15:12]).\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The synchronous reset initializes all digits in 'q' to 0 when asserted high at the clock's positive edge.\n- The reset also clears the 'ena' signals to zero during the reset condition.\n\nClock and Timing:\n- All sequential elements, including the BCD counter and enable signals, are triggered by the positive edge of 'clk'.\n- The counter increments with each clock cycle unless reset is asserted.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Each BCD digit wraps from 9 (1001 in binary) back to 0 (0000 in binary) upon increment, triggering the next higher digit's enable signal.\n- The counter operates within the BCD range for each digit (0-9).\n\nNote: Ensure that all logic and state transitions adhere to BCD encoding constraints for accurate counting and enable signal generation.\n                    "
