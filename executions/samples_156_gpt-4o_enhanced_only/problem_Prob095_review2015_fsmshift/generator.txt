Let's implement the `TopModule` based on the specification and guidelines provided. This module will be a simple finite state machine (FSM) that counts up to 4 clock cycles after a reset, during which it asserts the `shift_ena` signal.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic shift_ena
);

    // Internal register to keep track of the FSM state/count
    logic [2:0] counter; // 3 bits to count up to 4

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Upon reset, initialize the counter and enable signal
            counter <= 3'd0;
            shift_ena <= 1'b1;
        end else if (shift_ena) begin
            // If shift_ena is asserted, count up
            if (counter == 3'd3) begin
                // After 4 cycles, deassert shift_ena
                shift_ena <= 1'b0;
            end else begin
                // Increment the counter
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation

- **Ports:** The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `shift_ena`, all of which are declared as `logic` for compatibility with SystemVerilog.
  
- **Counter:** A 3-bit counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that `shift_ena` has been asserted. This counter can count from 0 to 7, but we only need it to count to 3 for a total of 4 cycles.

- **Reset Logic:** 
  - When `reset` is asserted (`1`), both the `counter` and `shift_ena` are initialized. The counter is set to `0`, and `shift_ena` is set to `1`.
  
- **Counting Logic:**
  - On each positive edge of `clk`, if `shift_ena` is `1`, the counter increments.
  - If the counter reaches `3`, indicating that `shift_ena` has been asserted for 4 cycles, `shift_ena` is deasserted (`0`).

This implementation ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles following a reset and remains deasserted until the next reset event.
