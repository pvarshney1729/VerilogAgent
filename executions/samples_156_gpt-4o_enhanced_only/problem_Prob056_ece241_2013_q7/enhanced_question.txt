<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. The interface consists of the following ports. All input and output ports are one bit wide:

- `input clk`: Clock signal, used to trigger the positive edge for the flip-flop.
- `input j`: Input signal for the JK flip-flop.
- `input k`: Input signal for the JK flip-flop.
- `output Q`: Output signal representing the current state of the JK flip-flop.

The `TopModule` should implement the behavior of a JK flip-flop, adhering to the following truth table. Note that `Qold` represents the state of the output `Q` before the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).

| J | K | Q     |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | Qold  |
| 0 | 1 | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | ~Qold |

**Specifications:**

1. **Clock and Edge Sensitivity**:
   - The JK flip-flop updates its output `Q` on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

2. **Reset Behavior**:
   - This specification does not define a reset input. Therefore, ensure that the initial state of the flip-flop is defined by the environment or testbench.

3. **Sequential Logic**:
   - The module contains sequential logic elements. The behavior of the output `Q` strictly depends on the inputs `j` and `k` as well as the previous state `Qold`, adhering to the truth table.

4. **Operation Precedence**:
   - The operation of toggling `Q` when both `j` and `k` are high (`1`) should be implemented as an inversion of the previous state `Qold`.

5. **Initial State**:
   - Since no initial reset is specified, the initial state of `Q` is undefined and should be set by the driving environment or simulation.

6. **Edge Cases and Boundaries**:
   - The behavior is fully specified under all combinations of `j` and `k` inputs. There are no additional edge cases beyond the specified truth table.

Ensure that the implementation respects these specifications to achieve the correct functional behavior of the JK flip-flop.
