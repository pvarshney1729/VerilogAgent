When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. The interface consists of the following ports. All input and output ports are one bit wide:\n\n- `input clk`: Clock signal, used to trigger the positive edge for the flip-flop.\n- `input j`: Input signal for the JK flip-flop.\n- `input k`: Input signal for the JK flip-flop.\n- `output Q`: Output signal representing the current state of the JK flip-flop.\n\nThe `TopModule` should implement the behavior of a JK flip-flop, adhering to the following truth table. Note that `Qold` represents the state of the output `Q` before the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`).\n\n| J | K | Q     |\n|---|---|-------|\n| 0 | 0 | Qold  |\n| 0 | 1 | 0     |\n| 1 | 0 | 1     |\n| 1 | 1 | ~Qold |\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Clock and Edge Sensitivity**:\n   - The JK flip-flop updates its output `Q` on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n\n2. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - This specification does not define a reset input. Therefore, ensure that the initial state of the flip-flop is defined by the environment or testbench.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic**:\n   - The module contains sequential logic elements. The behavior of the output `Q` strictly depends on the inputs `j` and `k` as well as the previous state `Qold`, adhering to the truth table.\n\n4. **Operation Precedence**:\n   - The operation of toggling `Q` when both `j` and `k` are high (`1`) should be implemented as an inversion of the previous state `Qold`.\n\n5. **Initial State**:\n   - Since no initial reset is specified, the initial state of `Q` is undefined and should be set by the driving environment or simulation.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundaries**:\n   - The behavior is fully specified under all combinations of `j` and `k` inputs. There are no additional edge cases beyond the specified truth table.\n\nEnsure that the implementation respects these specifications to achieve the correct functional behavior of the JK flip-flop.\n                    "
