Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [3:0] x`: A 4-bit wide input vector where `x[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `x[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
- Output Ports:
  - `output f`: A 1-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic function `f` based on the provided Karnaugh map. The function is determined by the bit values of the input vector `x`.

Karnaugh Map Definition:
- The Karnaugh map is defined using bits `x[3]x[4]` as row selectors and bits `x[1]x[2]` as column selectors.
- Each cell in the Karnaugh map corresponds to the output `f` for a specific combination of `x[3]x[4]x[1]x[2]`.

Karnaugh Map:
```
                x[1]x[2]
  x[3]x[4]   00  01  11  10
        00 | d |  0 | d | d |
        01 | 0 |  d | 1 | 0 |
        11 | 1 |  1 | d | d |
        10 | 1 |  1 | 0 | d |
```
- Here, "d" indicates don't-care conditions where the output `f` can be either 0 or 1, depending on optimization or convenience.

Operational Details:
- The logic function `f` is combinational, meaning it updates immediately based on changes in the input `x`.
- There are no sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops or registers) involved, so no clock or reset signals are necessary.
- Ensure that the logic for `f` is minimized using the don't-care conditions for optimal synthesis.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Since `x` is a 4-bit input, all combinations from `0000` to `1111` must be considered.
- Handle the don't-care conditions to optimize the logic circuit, but ensure the specified outputs (0 or 1) are correctly assigned in the Karnaugh map.

No assumptions are made regarding the initial state or transitions, as the logic is purely combinational and driven by inputs.
