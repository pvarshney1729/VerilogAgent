All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  x\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine with the following\nbehavior. Input x goes to three different two-input gates: an XOR, an\nAND, and a OR gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of\na D flip-flop and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input\nNOR gate, whose output is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding\nflip-flop's output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding\nflip-flop's complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR\nis its corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.\n\nAssume that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the\nmachine begins. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive\nedge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Definition:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronization. All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of this signal.\n  - `input x`: 1-bit input signal for the finite state machine.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output z`: 1-bit output signal representing the result of the finite state machine logic.\n\nSignal and Logic Description:\n1. Input `x` is fed into three two-input gates: XOR, AND, and OR.\n   - XOR Gate: The first input is `x`, and the second input is the output of its corresponding D flip-flop.\n   - AND Gate: The first input is `x`, and the second input is the complement of its corresponding D flip-flop's output.\n   - OR Gate: The first input is `x`, and the second input is the complement of its corresponding D flip-flop's output.\n\n2. Outputs of the XOR, AND, and OR gates are connected to the inputs of their respective D flip-flops.\n\n3. Three D flip-flops are used, each associated with one of the gates (XOR, AND, OR). \n   - All flip-flops are positive edge-triggered by the `clk` signal.\n   - Initial State: All D flip-flops are initialized to '0' on a synchronous reset.\n\n4. The outputs of the D flip-flops are then fed into a three-input NOR gate.\n   - The output `z` is the result of this NOR gate.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- The D flip-flops are initially reset to '0' before the system begins operation. The reset is synchronous with the clock signal.\n\nBit Conventions:\n- The ports `clk`, `x`, and `z` are all 1-bit signals. Bit[0] represents the least significant bit.\n\nBehavioral Note:\n- Ensure no race conditions occur, as all flip-flops are triggered on the same clock edge.\n- The output `z` is determined by the NOR condition of the outputs of the three D flip-flops.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Correct functioning is expected for all valid input combinations of `x`.\n- The system should handle the initial state where all flip-flops are reset to 0.\n\nThis module should be implemented with the above specifications to ensure correct functionality.\n                    "
