All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n  - input  a\n  - input  b\n  - input  c\n  - input  d\n  - output out_sop\n  - output out_pos\n\nThe module should implement a digital system with four inputs (a,b,c,d)\nthat generates a logic-1 when 2, 7, or 15 appears on the inputs, and a\nlogic-0 when 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14 appears. The input\nconditions for the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 never occur in this system.\nFor example, 7 corresponds to a,b,c,d being set to 0,1,1,1, respectively.\nDetermine the output out_sop in minimum sum-of-products form, and the\noutput out_pos in minimum product-of-sums form.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a, // Bit 0 (LSB)\n  - input wire b, // Bit 1\n  - input wire c, // Bit 2\n  - input wire d  // Bit 3 (MSB)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out_sop, // Output determined using minimum sum-of-products form\n  - output wire out_pos  // Output determined using minimum product-of-sums form\n\nFunctional Description:\n- This module is a combinational logic circuit that evaluates its inputs (a, b, c, d) as a 4-bit binary number.\n- The inputs are considered to form a binary number where 'd' is the most significant bit (MSB) and 'a' is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- The outputs are determined by specific input combinations as follows:\n\n  - Outputs:\n    - out_sop (Sum of Products):\n      - out_sop = 1 when the input binary number is 2, 7, or 15.\n      - out_sop = 0 when the input binary number is 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14.\n    \n    - out_pos (Product of Sums):\n      - out_pos = 1 when the input binary number is 2, 7, or 15.\n      - out_pos = 0 when the input binary number is 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14.\n\n- Unused Input Combinations:\n  - The input combinations corresponding to the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 do not occur and hence do not affect the outputs.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- Ensure that the logic for determining out_sop and out_pos adheres strictly to the conditions described above.\n- This is a purely combinational logic design; no clock or reset signals are involved.\n- There are no sequential elements or state dependencies; outputs are solely dependent on the current inputs.\n- Prioritize minimizing logic complexity while adhering to the given conditions for both SOP and POS forms.\n                    "
