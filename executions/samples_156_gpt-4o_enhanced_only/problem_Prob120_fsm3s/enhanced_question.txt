Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input  logic clk  // Clock signal; triggers sequential logic on rising edge
- input  logic reset  // Synchronous active high reset signal; resets FSM to state A
- input  logic in  // Input signal for state transitions
- output logic out  // Output signal reflecting current state output

State Machine Description:
- This module is a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.
- The state transitions and outputs are based on the following table:

  State | Next state (in=0), Next state (in=1) | Output
  --------------------------------------------------------
  A     | A, B                                 | 0
  B     | C, B                                 | 0
  C     | A, D                                 | 0
  D     | C, B                                 | 1

- Upon receiving a synchronous active high reset signal, the FSM will reset to state A.

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- All sequential logic, including state transitions, is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
- The reset is synchronous: the FSM will enter state A on the next rising edge of the clock when reset is high.

State Encoding:
- Each state will be encoded using a minimum number of bits to represent four states. For example, a 2-bit representation may be used, with a specific encoding chosen for each state (e.g., A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10, D = 2'b11).

Output:
- The output 'out' directly corresponds to the current state:
  - 'out' = 0 for states A, B, and C.
  - 'out' = 1 for state D.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon power-up or reset, the FSM will initialize to state A, and the output 'out' will be set to 0.
