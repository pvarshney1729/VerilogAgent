Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: a
  - Type: wire
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Description: First data input for the multiplexer.

- Input: b
  - Type: wire
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Description: Second data input for the multiplexer.

- Input: sel
  - Type: wire
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Description: Select signal for the multiplexer. Determines which input is routed to the output.
  - Note: Logic level '0' selects input 'a', and logic level '1' selects input 'b'.

- Output: out
  - Type: wire
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Description: Output of the multiplexer, reflecting the selected input based on the 'sel' signal.

Operational Description:
- The module functions as a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer.
- The selection logic is purely combinational.
- The output 'out' is determined by the value of 'sel':
  - If sel = 0, 'out' is assigned the value of 'a'.
  - If sel = 1, 'out' is assigned the value of 'b'.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the multiplexer logic is implemented without introducing any race conditions.
- The module is designed to operate with zero propagation delay; hence, it does not incorporate any sequential elements or clock signals.
- All signal transitions are assumed to be ideal with no setup or hold time requirements.

Boundary and Edge Case Considerations:
- Since all inputs are 1 bit wide, no additional edge cases apply beyond the valid logical states (0 and 1) for each input.

Initial Conditions:
- As the module is purely combinational, no initial states or reset conditions are applicable.
