Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` as specified. This module acts as a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer, selecting between inputs `a` and `b` based on the control signal `sel`.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic sel,
    output logic out
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (sel == 1'b0) begin
            out = a;
        end else begin
            out = b;
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This implementation adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The `always @(*)` block ensures that the logic is combinational, and the use of `logic` for port declarations is consistent with modern Verilog practices. The multiplexer uses an `if-else` construct to select between the inputs based on the `sel` signal.
