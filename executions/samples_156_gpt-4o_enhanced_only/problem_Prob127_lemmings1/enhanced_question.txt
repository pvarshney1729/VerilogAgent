Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal. All sequential operations occur on the positive edge of this clock.
- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal. Active high, resets the module to the initial state.
- input wire bump_left: Active high signal indicating an obstacle on the left.
- input wire bump_right: Active high signal indicating an obstacle on the right.
- output reg walk_left: Indicates the Lemming is walking left. A high signal (1) represents walking left.
- output reg walk_right: Indicates the Lemming is walking right. A high signal (1) represents walking right.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states:
  1. State 0 (Walking Left): walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0.
  2. State 1 (Walking Right): walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1.

State Transition Logic:
- Initial State: On areset, the state machine resets to the Walking Left state, regardless of other inputs.
- Transition from Walking Left to Walking Right: Occurs on the next clock edge if bump_left is high.
- Transition from Walking Right to Walking Left: Occurs on the next clock edge if bump_right is high.
- If both bump_left and bump_right are high simultaneously, the Lemming will switch directions.

Reset Behavior:
- The areset signal is asynchronous and resets the state machine to the Walking Left state on its positive edge.
- During reset, walk_left is set to 1 and walk_right to 0.

Signal Conventions:
- bit[0] refers to the least significant bit in any multi-bit signal.
- All state transitions and output updates occur synchronously with the clock, except for the asynchronous reset.

Edge Cases:
- If bump_left and bump_right are both 0, the Lemming continues walking in its current direction.
- Simultaneous high signals on bump_left and bump_right will cause a direction switch.

Ensure that all state transitions and outputs are defined according to the above logic to maintain correct functionality.
