All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  a\n - output q\n\nThis is a sequential circuit. Read the simulation waveforms to determine\nwhat the circuit does, then implement it.\n\n  time  clk a   q\n  0ns   0   x   x\n  5ns   1   0   x\n  10ns  0   0   x\n  15ns  1   0   1\n  20ns  0   0   1\n  25ns  1   0   1\n  30ns  0   0   1\n  35ns  1   1   1\n  40ns  0   1   1\n  45ns  1   1   0\n  50ns  0   1   0\n  55ns  1   1   0\n  60ns  0   1   0\n  65ns  1   1   0\n  70ns  0   1   0\n  75ns  1   1   0\n  80ns  0   1   0\n  85ns  1   1   0\n  90ns  0   1   0\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for TopModule:\n\n1. **Module Name**: TopModule\n\n2. **Interface**:\n   - **Inputs**:\n     - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, active on the positive edge.\n     - `input wire a`: Single-bit input signal.\n   - **Outputs**:\n     - `output reg q`: Single-bit output signal.\n\n3. **Signal Conventions**:\n   - Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n   - All signals are unsigned.\n\n4. **Sequential Logic**:\n   - This circuit is sequential and operates based on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n   - The output `q` is updated on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n5. **Operation Description**:\n   - The output `q` is determined by a combination of the current state of input `a` and the previous state of `q`.\n   - At the initial state (`0ns`), the values of `a` and `q` are undefined (`x`).\n\n6. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - The specification does not describe any reset input or behavior. Assume `q` retains its state unless specified by behavior under clock cycles.\n\n7. **Simulation Waveform Analysis**:\n   - From `15ns` onwards, the output `q` is set based on the following rules:\n     - If `a` is `0` during the rising edge of `clk`, `q` remains `1`.\n     - If `a` is `1` during the rising edge of `clk`, `q` transitions to `0`.\n\n8. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - The initial value of `q` is assumed to be `undefined`. The behavior of the module is derived from the transition of `q` as observed in the simulation waveform starting from `15ns`.\n\n9. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the behavior when transitioning from `0ns` to `15ns` is consistent with the waveform; assume undefined states (`x`) for `q` initially.\n\n10. **Clock and Timing**:\n    - Ensure that all operations related to `q` are synchronized with the positive edge of the `clk`.\n\nThis specification should be followed precisely to ensure the correct implementation of the module's intended functionality.\n                    "
