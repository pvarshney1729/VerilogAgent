Based on the waveform analysis and the specifications provided, here's the implementation for the `TopModule`. The logic for updating `q` is derived from the simulation where `q` transitions to `0` when `a` is `1` at the rising edge of `clk` and remains `1` when `a` is `0`.

Here is the Verilog code for the module:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic a,
    output logic q
);

    // Initial state of q is undefined, but we assume it's initialized to 1
    initial begin
        q = 1'b1;
    end

    // Sequential logic block triggered on the rising edge of clk
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (a == 1'b1) begin
            q <= 1'b0; // Set q to 0 when a is 1
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This code initializes `q` to `1` and specifies that on each rising edge of the clock, if `a` is `1`, then `q` is set to `0`. Otherwise, it retains its current state. This behavior matches the description derived from the simulation waveform.
