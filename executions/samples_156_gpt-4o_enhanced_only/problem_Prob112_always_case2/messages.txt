All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in  (4 bits)\n - output pos (2 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a priority encoder. A priority encoder is a\ncombinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the\nposition of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority\nencoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is\nfirst bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem,\nif none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero.\nNote that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input [3:0] in`: A 4-bit unsigned input vector where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output [1:0] pos`: A 2-bit unsigned output vector representing the position of the first '1' encountered in the input vector, with bit[0] as the LSB and bit[1] as the MSB. If no '1' is present, the output should be zero.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a combinational logic priority encoder.\n- The priority encoder examines the input vector `in` and identifies the position of the first high ('1') bit starting from the most significant bit towards the least significant bit.\n- Specifically, if `in` is `4'b0001`, `pos` should output `2'b00`. If `in` is `4'b0010`, `pos` should output `2'b01`. If `in` is `4'b0100`, `pos` should output `2'b10`. If `in` is `4'b1000`, `pos` should output `2'b11`.\n- In the case where `in` is `4'b0000`, indicating no high bits are present, `pos` should output `2'b00`.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The module utilizes combinational logic only; there is no clock or reset signal involved, as it does not contain sequential elements.\n- Ensure that the logic captures all possible 16 input combinations for a 4-bit input, with specific attention to edge cases where the input is zero.\n                    "
