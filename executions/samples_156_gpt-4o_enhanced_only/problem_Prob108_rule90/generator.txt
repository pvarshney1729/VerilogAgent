Sure, let's implement the `TopModule` according to the specified requirements and guidelines. This module will use a clock signal to update the state of a 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton. Here's the Verilog code:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic load,
    input logic [511:0] data,
    output logic [511:0] q
);

    logic [511:0] next_q;

    // Combinational logic for calculating the next state of the automaton
    always @(*) begin
        // Initialize the next state based on the current state and Rule 90
        next_q[0] = q[1]; // q[-1] is considered 0, so q[0]'s next state is q[1]
        next_q[511] = q[510]; // q[512] is considered 0, so q[511]'s next state is q[510]
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 511; i = i + 1) begin
            next_q[i] = q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];
        end
    end

    // Sequential logic to update the state on the positive edge of the clock
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data; // Load the initial state when load is high
        end else begin
            q <= next_q; // Otherwise, update to the next state
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This code implements a 512-cell Rule 90 cellular automaton, where the cells are updated each clock cycle based on their neighbors' states. The `load` signal allows the state of the automaton to be set initially. The boundaries are assumed to be zero, as specified.
