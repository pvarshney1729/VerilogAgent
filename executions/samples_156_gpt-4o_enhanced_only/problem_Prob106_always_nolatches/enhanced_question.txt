<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, is designed to interpret 16-bit scancodes from a PS/2 keyboard to detect arrow key presses used in a game. The module has the following interface specifications:

- **Inputs:**
  - `scancode`: A 16-bit unsigned input, where `scancode[15]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `scancode[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- **Outputs:**
  - `left`: A 1-bit output that is asserted (logic high) when the left arrow key is pressed.
  - `down`: A 1-bit output that is asserted when the down arrow key is pressed.
  - `right`: A 1-bit output that is asserted when the right arrow key is pressed.
  - `up`: A 1-bit output that is asserted when the up arrow key is pressed.

The module processes the scancode input to determine if any of the arrow keys are pressed. Use a combinational logic approach, such as a case statement or if-else-if ladder, to map the scancode to the corresponding arrow key output. The mapping is as follows:

- `scancode` = 16'hE06B: Assert `left` = 1
- `scancode` = 16'hE072: Assert `down` = 1
- `scancode` = 16'hE074: Assert `right` = 1
- `scancode` = 16'hE075: Assert `up` = 1
- For any other value of `scancode`, all outputs (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) should be deasserted (logic low).

Ensure that the outputs reflect the current state of the scancode input without any clock dependency, as this is a purely combinational circuit. No flip-flops or registers are required, and there is no need for reset logic since the outputs will always reflect the current input state.
