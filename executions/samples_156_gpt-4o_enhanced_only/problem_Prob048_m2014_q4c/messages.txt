All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  d\n - input  r\n - output q\n\nThe module should implement a simple D flip flop with active high\nsynchronous reset (reset output to 0).\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule implements a D flip-flop with an active high synchronous reset. The output 'q' is set to 0 when the reset 'r' is asserted during the rising edge of the clock 'clk'.\n\nInterface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal (1-bit). The state of the flip-flop changes on the rising edge of this clock.\n- input wire d: Data input (1-bit). The data to be captured by the flip-flop at the rising edge of 'clk' if reset 'r' is not asserted.\n- input wire r: Synchronous reset (1-bit). An active high signal that, when asserted, sets the output 'q' to 0 at the next rising edge of 'clk'.\n- output reg q: Output of the flip-flop (1-bit). Holds the value of 'd' unless 'r' is asserted.\n\nBehavior:\n- The flip-flop samples the input 'd' on the rising edge of 'clk'.\n- If 'r' is high during the rising edge of 'clk', the output 'q' is reset to 0.\n- If 'r' is low, the output 'q' will follow the input 'd' on the next rising edge of 'clk'.\n- This is a synchronous reset design, meaning 'r' only affects 'q' at the clock's rising edge.\n\nInitial State:\n- The initial state of output 'q' should be defined by the synthesis tool or reset during simulation, typically starting as 0.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure that 'r' is held high for at least one clock cycle to guarantee a reset of 'q'.\n- There are no asynchronous reset conditions; all operations are synchronous with respect to 'clk'.\n                    "
