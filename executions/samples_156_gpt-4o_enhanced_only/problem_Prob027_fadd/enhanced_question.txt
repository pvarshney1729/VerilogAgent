Module Name: TopModule

Description:
This module implements a one-bit full adder. A full adder takes three input bits, including a carry-in bit, and produces a sum bit and a carry-out bit.

Port Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a`: A single-bit input operand.
  - `input wire b`: A single-bit input operand.
  - `input wire cin`: A single-bit carry-in input.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire cout`: A single-bit carry-out output.
  - `output wire sum`: A single-bit sum output.

Functional Description:
- Inputs:
  - `a`, `b`, and `cin` are the three input bits to the adder.
  - All inputs are considered to be unsigned and are single-bit wide.

- Outputs:
  - `sum` is the least significant bit of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `cin`.
  - `cout` is the carry-out bit resulting from the addition, indicating overflow into the next significant bit in a multi-bit addition context.

Operation:
- The full adder performs the following operations:
  - `sum = a XOR b XOR cin`
  - `cout = (a AND b) OR (b AND cin) OR (cin AND a)`

- The full adder's operation is combinational, with no clock or reset signals involved. It immediately reflects changes in the input signals on the outputs.

Edge Cases:
- The module correctly handles all combinations of `a`, `b`, and `cin` (i.e., all possible input states from 000 to 111).

Indexing Conventions:
- As each input and output is a single bit, specific bit indexing is not applicable beyond the single-bit context.

Timing:
- The module is purely combinational, with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.

Reset Behavior:
- Not applicable, as the module contains no sequential logic.
