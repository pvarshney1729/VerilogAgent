Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk` : Clock signal, used for triggering sequential logic. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `input reset` : Active-high, synchronous reset signal. When high, it resets the counter value to 0 at the next positive clock edge.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `output [3:0] q` : 4-bit output representing the current count, with bit[3] being the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] being the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 4-bit binary counter.
- The counter counts sequentially from 0 to 15 (inclusive), creating a counting period of 16 clock cycles.
- On each positive edge of the clock (`clk`), if `reset` is not asserted, the counter value increments by 1.
- If `reset` is asserted (high) on a positive clock edge, the counter is synchronously reset to 0.

Initial Conditions:
- At power-up or initial start of the module, the counter output `q` should be initialized to 0.

Edge Cases:
- When the counter reaches its maximum value (15), the next increment results in the counter wrapping around to 0.

Requirements:
- Ensure that the reset operation has precedence over the counting operation when `reset` is high during a clock edge.
- The design should be free of race conditions and should handle the synchronous reset and counting operations deterministically.
