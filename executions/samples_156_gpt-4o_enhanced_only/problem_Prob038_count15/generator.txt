Sure! Here's the Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the count value
    logic [3:0] count;

    // Sequential logic block triggered on the positive edge of the clock
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset: Set count to 0 when reset is high
            count <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            // Increment the count by one
            count <= count + 1;
        end
    end

    // Assign the internal count to the output
    assign q = count;

endmodule
[DONE]

This implementation uses an always_ff block to ensure that it is synthesizable and adheres to the synchronous reset requirement. The counting logic is straightforward, incrementing the 4-bit counter at each positive clock edge unless reset is asserted. The counter wraps around naturally due to its 4-bit width.
