<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module 'TopModule' is designed to interface with a serial communication protocol using the following ports:

- `input logic clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential operations, triggered on the positive edge.
- `input logic reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the system resets to its initial state.
- `input logic in`: Serial data input stream.
- `output logic done`: Output signal that indicates successful reception of a complete data byte.

The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process incoming serial data according to the following protocol:

1. **Protocol Overview**:
   - A data transmission consists of one start bit (logic 0), followed by 8 data bits, and concludes with one stop bit (logic 1).
   - The line defaults to logic 1 when idle.
   - Data bits are transmitted starting with the least significant bit (LSB).

2. **FSM Operation**:
   - **Initial State**: The FSM begins in an idle state, continuously monitoring the input stream for a start bit.
   - **Start Bit Detection**: Transition from the idle state occurs upon detection of a logic 0 (start bit).
   - **Data Bit Reception**: After detecting the start bit, the FSM sequentially captures the next 8 bits as data bits.
     - Bit indexing follows: `bit[0]` represents the least significant bit (LSB) of the data, incrementing to `bit[7]` (most significant bit, MSB).
   - **Stop Bit Verification**: After receiving the 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a logic 1 stop bit.
   - **Completion**: If the stop bit is correct, the `done` signal is asserted high for one clock cycle, indicating successful byte reception.
   - **Error Handling**: If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM enters an error state, remaining there until a logic 1 (idle/stop bit) is detected, after which it resets to the initial state to await the next start bit.

3. **Reset Behavior**:
   - The FSM resets to the initial idle state on the assertion of the `reset` signal. All internal state and data registers are cleared.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the `in` signal does not transition to idle (logic 1) after an incorrect stop bit, the FSM remains in the error state until it does.

This specification ensures robust handling of the serial data stream, allowing the FSM to correctly receive and validate data bytes within the constraints of the defined protocol.
