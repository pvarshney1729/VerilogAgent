<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. The ports are defined as:

- Input: `A`, a 2-bit vector, denoted as `A[1:0]`, where `A[1]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `A[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
- Input: `B`, a 2-bit vector, denoted as `B[1:0]`, where `B[1]` is the MSB and `B[0]` is the LSB.
- Output: `z`, a 1-bit signal.

The module should implement combinational logic that compares the two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`. The output `z` should be set to logic high ('1') if and only if the value of vector `A` is equal to the value of vector `B`. Otherwise, the output `z` should be set to logic low ('0').

The comparison is bitwise and does not involve any signed arithmetic; hence, the comparison is straightforward equality between the two vectors.

Considerations:
- There are no clock signals or sequential elements involved in this module, as the logic is purely combinational.
- Inputs `A` and `B` are expected to be valid and stable for the duration of the operation, ensuring that the output `z` reflects the correct comparison result at all times.
- There are no additional conditions or edge cases beyond the specified comparison of the bit vectors.
