Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, used for triggering the D flip-flop on the positive edge.
  - `input wire in`: Single bit input for the XOR gate.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg out`: Single bit output from the D flip-flop, also used as an input to the XOR gate.

Circuit Description:
- The module consists of a D flip-flop and a two-input XOR gate.
- The XOR gate has two inputs:
  1. `in`: External input.
  2. `out`: Feedback from the output of the D flip-flop.
- The XOR gate performs bitwise exclusive OR on these inputs.

Sequential Logic:
- The D flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- No reset mechanism is provided; hence, the initial state of `out` is undefined at power-up.
- The output of the XOR gate is fed as the input to the D flip-flop.

Data Flow:
- On each positive edge of `clk`, the D flip-flop captures the current output of the XOR gate and stores it in `out`.
- `out` is continuously fed back to the XOR gate as one of its inputs, creating a feedback loop.

Note:
- Ensure that the clock signal `clk` is stable and free from glitches to avoid unpredictable behavior in the flip-flop.
- Undefined initial state of `out` may need consideration in the overall system design if a specific startup behavior is required.
