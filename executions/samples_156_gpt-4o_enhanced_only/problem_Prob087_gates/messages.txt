All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - output out_and\n - output out_or\n - output out_xor\n - output out_nand\n - output out_nor\n - output out_xnor\n - output out_anotb\n\nThe module should implement a combinational circuit with two inputs, a\nand b. There are 7 outputs, each with a logic gate driving it:\n\n  (1) out_and: a and b\n  (2) out_or: a or b\n  (3) out_xor: a xor b\n  (4) out_nand: a nand b\n  (5) out_nor: a nor b\n  (6) out_xnor: a xnor b\n  (7) out_anotb: a and-not b\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire a`: One-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire b`: One-bit input signal.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out_and`: One-bit output signal representing the logical AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n  - `output wire out_or`: One-bit output signal representing the logical OR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n  - `output wire out_xor`: One-bit output signal representing the logical XOR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n  - `output wire out_nand`: One-bit output signal representing the logical NAND operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n  - `output wire out_nor`: One-bit output signal representing the logical NOR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n  - `output wire out_xnor`: One-bit output signal representing the logical XNOR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n  - `output wire out_anotb`: One-bit output signal representing the logical AND operation between input `a` and the negation of input `b`.\n\nDesign Requirements:\n- The module is a combinational logic circuit.\n- All input and output signals are single-bit wide, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit.\n- There is no clock or reset signal required as the module is purely combinational.\n- The logic operations are defined as follows:\n  1. `out_and`: Output is high (1) if both `a` and `b` are high (1); otherwise, low (0).\n  2. `out_or`: Output is high (1) if either `a` or `b` or both are high (1); otherwise, low (0).\n  3. `out_xor`: Output is high (1) if `a` and `b` are different; otherwise, low (0).\n  4. `out_nand`: Output is low (0) if both `a` and `b` are high (1); otherwise, high (1).\n  5. `out_nor`: Output is low (0) if either `a` or `b` or both are high (1); otherwise, high (1).\n  6. `out_xnor`: Output is high (1) if `a` and `b` are the same; otherwise, low (0).\n  7. `out_anotb`: Output is high (1) if `a` is high (1) and `b` is low (0); otherwise, low (0).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The outputs are deterministic and depend solely on the current values of inputs `a` and `b`.\n- No undefined behavior or race conditions are expected as the design is fully combinational without any sequential elements.\n                    "
