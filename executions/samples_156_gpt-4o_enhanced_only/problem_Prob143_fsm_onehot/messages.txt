All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in\n - input  state (10 bits)\n - output next_state (10 bits)\n - output out1\n - output out2\n\nGiven the follow state machine with 1 input and 2 outputs (the outputs\nare given as \"(out1, out2)\"):\n\n  S0 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S0 (0, 0) --1--> S1\n  S1 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S1 (0, 0) --1--> S2\n  S2 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S2 (0, 0) --1--> S3\n  S3 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S3 (0, 0) --1--> S4\n  S4 (0, 0) --0--> S0\n  S4 (0, 0) --1--> S5\n  S5 (0, 0) --0--> S8\n  S5 (0, 0) --1--> S6\n  S6 (0, 0) --0--> S9\n  S6 (0, 0) --1--> S7\n  S7 (0, 1) --0--> S0\n  S7 (0, 1) --1--> S7\n  S8 (1, 0) --0--> S0\n  S8 (1, 0) --1--> S1\n  S9 (1, 1) --0--> S0\n  S9 (1, 1) --1--> S1\n\nSuppose this state machine uses one-hot encoding, where state[0] through\nstate[9] correspond to the states S0 though S9, respectively. The outputs\nare zero unless otherwise specified. The next_state[0] through next_state[9] \ncorrespond to the transition to next states S0 though S9. For example, The \nnext_state[1] is set to 1 when the next state is S1 , otherwise, it is set to 0.\n\nHere, the input state[9:0] can be a combinational of multiple states, and \nthe TopModule is expected to response.\nFor example: \nWhen the state[9:0] = 10'b0000010100, state[4] == 1, and state[2] == 1, the \nstates includes S4, and S2 states.\n\nThe module should implement the state transition logic and output logic\nportions of the state machine (but not the state flip-flops). You are\ngiven the current state in state[9:0] and must implement next_state[9:0] \nand the two outputs.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire in`: A 1-bit input signal used to determine state transitions.\n  - `input wire [9:0] state`: A 10-bit input vector representing the current state using one-hot encoding. Each bit corresponds to a state S0 to S9, where `state[0]` represents S0 and `state[9]` represents S9.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [9:0] next_state`: A 10-bit output vector representing the next state using one-hot encoding. Each bit corresponds to a state S0 to S9, where `next_state[0]` represents S0 and `next_state[9]` represents S9.\n  - `output reg out1`: A 1-bit output signal determined by the current state.\n  - `output reg out2`: A 1-bit output signal determined by the current state.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- This state machine employs one-hot encoding with states S0 through S9.\n- Transitions between states are determined by the 1-bit input `in`.\n- The state machine's outputs `(out1, out2)` are defined for each state.\n\nState Transition Table:\n- S0: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S1 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).\n- S1: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S2 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).\n- S2: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S3 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).\n- S3: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S4 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).\n- S4: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S5 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).\n- S5: Transitions to S8 on `in == 0`, to S6 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).\n- S6: Transitions to S9 on `in == 0`, to S7 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).\n- S7: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, remains in S7 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 1).\n- S8: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S1 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (1, 0).\n- S9: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S1 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (1, 1).\n\nState Encoding:\n- Each state is represented by a single high bit in a 10-bit vector.\n- Example: `state[3]` high indicates the machine is in S3.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- Outputs `out1` and `out2` are determined by the current state as per the state transition table.\n\nOperational Notes:\n- The module assumes the current state is provided by the `state` input.\n- The next state is determined by evaluating the input `in` against the current state and setting `next_state` accordingly.\n- The outputs `out1` and `out2` are updated based on the current state.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle cases where more than one bit in `state` is high by evaluating all active states and determining the correct transitions as per the state table.\n- All unspecified transitions should default to output (0, 0) and transition to S0 unless otherwise stated.\n                    "
