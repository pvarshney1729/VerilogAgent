Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in`: A 1-bit input signal used to determine state transitions.
  - `input wire [9:0] state`: A 10-bit input vector representing the current state using one-hot encoding. Each bit corresponds to a state S0 to S9, where `state[0]` represents S0 and `state[9]` represents S9.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [9:0] next_state`: A 10-bit output vector representing the next state using one-hot encoding. Each bit corresponds to a state S0 to S9, where `next_state[0]` represents S0 and `next_state[9]` represents S9.
  - `output reg out1`: A 1-bit output signal determined by the current state.
  - `output reg out2`: A 1-bit output signal determined by the current state.

State Machine Description:
- This state machine employs one-hot encoding with states S0 through S9.
- Transitions between states are determined by the 1-bit input `in`.
- The state machine's outputs `(out1, out2)` are defined for each state.

State Transition Table:
- S0: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S1 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).
- S1: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S2 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).
- S2: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S3 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).
- S3: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S4 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).
- S4: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S5 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).
- S5: Transitions to S8 on `in == 0`, to S6 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).
- S6: Transitions to S9 on `in == 0`, to S7 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 0).
- S7: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, remains in S7 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (0, 1).
- S8: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S1 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (1, 0).
- S9: Transitions to S0 on `in == 0`, to S1 on `in == 1`. Outputs are (1, 1).

State Encoding:
- Each state is represented by a single high bit in a 10-bit vector.
- Example: `state[3]` high indicates the machine is in S3.

Output Logic:
- Outputs `out1` and `out2` are determined by the current state as per the state transition table.

Operational Notes:
- The module assumes the current state is provided by the `state` input.
- The next state is determined by evaluating the input `in` against the current state and setting `next_state` accordingly.
- The outputs `out1` and `out2` are updated based on the current state.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle cases where more than one bit in `state` is high by evaluating all active states and determining the correct transitions as per the state table.
- All unspecified transitions should default to output (0, 0) and transition to S0 unless otherwise stated.
