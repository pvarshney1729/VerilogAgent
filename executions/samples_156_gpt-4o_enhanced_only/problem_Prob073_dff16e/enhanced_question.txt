Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, used to trigger all D flip-flops on its rising edge.
  - `resetn`: 1-bit synchronous, active-low reset signal. When asserted low, all registers are reset to a predefined initial value.
  - `byteena`: 2-bit signal, where `byteena[1]` controls writing to the upper byte `d[15:8]` and `byteena[0]` controls writing to the lower byte `d[7:0]`.
  - `d`: 16-bit data input, with `d[15]` representing the most significant bit (MSB) and `d[0]` the least significant bit (LSB).

- Outputs:
  - `q`: 16-bit data output, reflecting the current state of the flip-flops.

Design Details:
- The module contains 16 D flip-flops, each corresponding to a bit in `q`.
- Flip-flop operation is synchronous with the clock (`clk`) and reset (`resetn`).
- On the rising edge of `clk`: 
  - If `resetn` is low, all flip-flops are set to 0.
  - If `resetn` is high, write operations to the flip-flops are controlled by `byteena`.
    - If `byteena[1]` is high, `d[15:8]` is written to `q[15:8]`.
    - If `byteena[0]` is high, `d[7:0]` is written to `q[7:0]`.
    - If `byteena` bits are low, the respective bytes of `q` retain their previous values.

- Initial State:
  - Upon reset (`resetn` asserted low), all `q` bits are initialized to 0.

- Edge Cases:
  - Ensure correct operation when `byteena` transitions between states, especially around clock edges, to prevent unintended writes.
  - Handle simultaneous reset and write conditions by prioritizing reset when `resetn` is low.

- Bit Indexing:
  - All bit indexing is zero-based, with `d[0]` indicating the least significant bit of the data input and `d[15]` the most significant bit.

This specification ensures that the module is correctly implemented with a clear understanding of input/output relationships and operational conditions.
