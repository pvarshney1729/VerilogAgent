All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  resetn\n - input  byteena ( 2 bits)\n - input  d       (16 bits)\n - output q       (16 bits)\n\nThe module should include 16 D flip-flops. It's sometimes useful to only\nmodify parts of a group of flip-flops. The byte-enable inputs control\nwhether each byte of the 16 registers should be written to on that cycle.\nbyteena[1] controls the upper byte d[15:8], while byteena[0] controls the\nlower byte d[7:0]. resetn is a synchronous, active-low reset. All DFFs\nshould be triggered by the positive edge of clk.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, used to trigger all D flip-flops on its rising edge.\n  - `resetn`: 1-bit synchronous, active-low reset signal. When asserted low, all registers are reset to a predefined initial value.\n  - `byteena`: 2-bit signal, where `byteena[1]` controls writing to the upper byte `d[15:8]` and `byteena[0]` controls writing to the lower byte `d[7:0]`.\n  - `d`: 16-bit data input, with `d[15]` representing the most significant bit (MSB) and `d[0]` the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `q`: 16-bit data output, reflecting the current state of the flip-flops.\n\nDesign Details:\n- The module contains 16 D flip-flops, each corresponding to a bit in `q`.\n- Flip-flop operation is synchronous with the clock (`clk`) and reset (`resetn`).\n- On the rising edge of `clk`: \n  - If `resetn` is low, all flip-flops are set to 0.\n  - If `resetn` is high, write operations to the flip-flops are controlled by `byteena`.\n    - If `byteena[1]` is high, `d[15:8]` is written to `q[15:8]`.\n    - If `byteena[0]` is high, `d[7:0]` is written to `q[7:0]`.\n    - If `byteena` bits are low, the respective bytes of `q` retain their previous values.\n\n- Initial State:\n  - Upon reset (`resetn` asserted low), all `q` bits are initialized to 0.\n\n- Edge Cases:\n  - Ensure correct operation when `byteena` transitions between states, especially around clock edges, to prevent unintended writes.\n  - Handle simultaneous reset and write conditions by prioritizing reset when `resetn` is low.\n\n- Bit Indexing:\n  - All bit indexing is zero-based, with `d[0]` indicating the least significant bit of the data input and `d[15]` the most significant bit.\n\nThis specification ensures that the module is correctly implemented with a clear understanding of input/output relationships and operational conditions.\n                    "
