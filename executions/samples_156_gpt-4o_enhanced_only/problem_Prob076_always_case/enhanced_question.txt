Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - sel: 3-bit unsigned input vector, where bit[2] is the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - data0: 4-bit unsigned input vector, with bit[3] as the MSB and bit[0] as the LSB.
  - data1: 4-bit unsigned input vector, with bit[3] as the MSB and bit[0] as the LSB.
  - data2: 4-bit unsigned input vector, with bit[3] as the MSB and bit[0] as the LSB.
  - data3: 4-bit unsigned input vector, with bit[3] as the MSB and bit[0] as the LSB.
  - data4: 4-bit unsigned input vector, with bit[3] as the MSB and bit[0] as the LSB.
  - data5: 4-bit unsigned input vector, with bit[3] as the MSB and bit[0] as the LSB.

- Outputs:
  - out: 4-bit unsigned output vector, with bit[3] as the MSB and bit[0] as the LSB.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 6-to-1 combinational multiplexer.
- The multiplexer selects one of the six 4-bit data inputs based on the 3-bit 'sel' input value:
  - If sel = 3'b000, then out = data0.
  - If sel = 3'b001, then out = data1.
  - If sel = 3'b010, then out = data2.
  - If sel = 3'b011, then out = data3.
  - If sel = 3'b100, then out = data4.
  - If sel = 3'b101, then out = data5.
- For any other value of sel (i.e., when sel is 3'b110 or 3'b111), the output 'out' should be set to 4'b0000, effectively zeroing the output.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the selection logic correctly interprets all 8 possible values of the 3-bit 'sel' input, including the unselected states (sel = 3'b110 and sel = 3'b111).
- The module assumes that all data inputs are stable and valid during operation, with no additional synchronization or error checking needed for this simple multiplexer design.
