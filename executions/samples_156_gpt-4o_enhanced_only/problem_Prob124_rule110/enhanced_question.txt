Module Name: TopModule

Interface Definition:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `load`: 1-bit synchronous, active-high signal. When high, the system loads new data.
  - `data`: 512-bit input vector. Represents initial states of the cellular automaton cells when `load` is asserted.

- Outputs:
  - `q`: 512-bit output vector. Represents the current states of the cellular automaton cells.

Functional Description:
- The module implements Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular automaton. 
- The automaton consists of 512 cells, with each cell having a state represented by a single bit (either on '1' or off '0').
- The next state of each cell is determined by itself and its two adjacent neighbors according to the following truth table:

  | Left (i+1) | Center (i) | Right (i-1) | Center's Next State |
  |------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
  | 1          | 1          | 1           | 0                   |
  | 1          | 1          | 0           | 1                   |
  | 1          | 0          | 1           | 1                   |
  | 1          | 0          | 0           | 0                   |
  | 0          | 1          | 1           | 1                   |
  | 0          | 1          | 0           | 1                   |
  | 0          | 0          | 1           | 1                   |
  | 0          | 0          | 0           | 0                   |

- Boundary Conditions:
  - The left boundary (virtual q[-1]) and the right boundary (virtual q[512]) are assumed to be always '0'.

Operational Details:
- On the positive edge of `clk`, if `load` is high, `q` is updated to the value of `data`.
- If `load` is low, `q` will update based on the Rule 110 logic applied to each cell and its neighbors.
- Indexing convention: q[0] refers to the least significant cell, and q[511] refers to the most significant cell.

Reset Behavior:
- This specification assumes there is no explicit reset signal. The `load` signal should be used to initialize or reinitialize the system.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure correct handling of the boundary cells where the leftmost and rightmost cells have only one neighbor, using virtual boundaries set to '0'.
