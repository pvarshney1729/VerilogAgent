All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  aresetn\n - input  x\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement a Mealy-type finite state machine that\nrecognizes the sequence \"101\" on an input signal named x. Your FSM should\nhave an output signal, z, that is asserted to logic-1 when the \"101\"\nsequence is detected. Your FSM should also have a negative edge triggered\nasynchronous reset. You may only have 3 states in your state machine.\nYour FSM should recognize overlapping sequences. Assume all sequential\nlogic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: \n  - `clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `aresetn`: Asynchronous reset signal, active low. It resets the FSM to its initial state on the negative edge.\n  - `x`: Input signal, 1-bit, representing the data stream to be evaluated.\n\n- Output:\n  - `z`: Output signal, 1-bit, asserted to logic-1 when the sequence \"101\" is detected.\n\nFSM Description:\n- Type: Mealy finite state machine.\n- Number of States: 3\n  - State 0 (S0): Initial state, also reset state. In this state, the FSM has not yet detected the \"101\" sequence.\n  - State 1 (S1): Intermediate state, where the FSM has detected the first '1' in the \"101\" sequence.\n  - State 2 (S2): Intermediate state, where the FSM has detected \"10\" of \"101\".\n\n- State Transitions and Output Logic:\n  - From S0:\n    - If `x` == 1, transition to S1. Output `z` = 0.\n    - If `x` == 0, remain in S0. Output `z` = 0.\n  - From S1:\n    - If `x` == 0, transition to S2. Output `z` = 0.\n    - If `x` == 1, remain in S1. Output `z` = 0.\n  - From S2:\n    - If `x` == 1, transition to S1. Output `z` = 1 (sequence \"101\" detected).\n    - If `x` == 0, transition to S0. Output `z` = 0.\n\n- Overlapping Sequences: The FSM should support overlapping sequence detection. For example, in the input \"10101\", the first \"101\" will be detected at the first occurrence, and the FSM should continue to recognize the next \"101\" without resetting.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Asynchronous Reset: The FSM should reset to state S0 on the negative edge of `aresetn`, regardless of the clock.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All state registers should be initialized to State S0 upon reset.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Input and output signals are 1-bit wide, no indexing is required.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure z is only asserted when the complete \"101\" sequence is detected. Partial sequences should not assert z.\n\nEnsure that all sequential elements and flip-flops are properly initialized and describe the behavior under all potential input conditions, respecting the reset conditions.\n                    "
