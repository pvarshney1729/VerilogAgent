Module Specification: TopModule

1. Module Interface:
   - Input Ports:
     - `input logic x;` // 1-bit input
     - `input logic y;` // 1-bit input
   - Output Ports:
     - `output logic z;` // 1-bit output

2. Boolean Functionality:
   - The module computes the output `z` using the boolean function: 
     `z = (x XOR y) AND x;`
   - The operation uses bitwise XOR and AND operations:
     - XOR (`^`): Outputs 1 if the number of 1's in the inputs is odd.
     - AND (`&`): Outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1.

3. Signal Details:
   - The inputs `x` and `y` are treated as unsigned 1-bit values.
   - The output `z` is an unsigned 1-bit value representing the result of the boolean expression.
   - All operations are combinational and have no sequential dependencies.

4. Bit Indexing and Conventions:
   - As inputs and outputs are single-bit, bit indexing is not applicable. 
   - No MSB/LSB conventions are necessary for this module.

5. Timing and Synchronization:
   - This module is purely combinational logic and does not involve any clock signals, resets, or state-holding elements.

6. Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
   - Since the inputs and outputs are single-bit, all possible input combinations are handled.
   - The module is designed to correctly handle all combinations of `x` and `y` without additional constraints.

This specification ensures a clear understanding of the module's requirements and its combinational nature, enabling correct and efficient implementation.
