Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: 
  - `input logic a`, a 1-bit logic input signal.
  - `input logic b`, a 1-bit logic input signal.

- Output:
  - `output logic out`, a 1-bit logic output signal.

Functionality:
- The module implements an XNOR gate. The output `out` should be high (logic 1) if and only if the inputs `a` and `b` are equal. Otherwise, `out` should be low (logic 0).

Logical Expression:
- The output `out` is defined by the logical expression: 
  - `out = ~(a ^ b);`
  - This expression uses the bitwise XOR operator `^` and the bitwise NOT operator `~`.

Signal Behavior:
- All signals are combinational, with the output `out` being immediately responsive to changes in inputs `a` and `b`.

Edge Case Handling:
- This module does not include sequential elements, and thus, no reset behavior is required.
- Ensure both inputs `a` and `b` are stable before sampling the output to avoid glitches.

Bit Indexing:
- Each bit signal is treated as a single entity due to their 1-bit width, hence no specific bit indexing is required.
