All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement an XNOR gate.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: \n  - `input logic a`, a 1-bit logic input signal.\n  - `input logic b`, a 1-bit logic input signal.\n\n- Output:\n  - `output logic out`, a 1-bit logic output signal.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements an XNOR gate. The output `out` should be high (logic 1) if and only if the inputs `a` and `b` are equal. Otherwise, `out` should be low (logic 0).\n\nLogical Expression:\n- The output `out` is defined by the logical expression: \n  - `out = ~(a ^ b);`\n  - This expression uses the bitwise XOR operator `^` and the bitwise NOT operator `~`.\n\nSignal Behavior:\n- All signals are combinational, with the output `out` being immediately responsive to changes in inputs `a` and `b`.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- This module does not include sequential elements, and thus, no reset behavior is required.\n- Ensure both inputs `a` and `b` are stable before sampling the output to avoid glitches.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Each bit signal is treated as a single entity due to their 1-bit width, hence no specific bit indexing is required.\n                    "
