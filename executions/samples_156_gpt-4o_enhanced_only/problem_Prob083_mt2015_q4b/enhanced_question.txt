Module Name: TopModule

Port Definition:
- input wire x: 1-bit input signal. 
- input wire y: 1-bit input signal. 
- output wire z: 1-bit output signal.

Signal Description:
- All signals (x, y, z) are 1-bit wide.
- The output z is determined based on the inputs x and y according to the specified waveform.

Waveform Interpretation:
- The output z is a combinational logic output based on the current values of inputs x and y.
- The output z can be derived from the following conditions:
  - When x = 0 and y = 0, z = 1.
  - When x = 1 and y = 0, z = 0.
  - When x = 0 and y = 1, z = 0.
  - When x = 1 and y = 1, z = 1.

Implementation Notes:
- This module is purely combinational; there are no sequential elements, registers, or flip-flops involved.
- There is no clock signal, as the operation of this module does not depend on time or sequential behavior.

Edge Case Considerations:
- Inputs are always assumed to be valid 1-bit binary signals (either 0 or 1).
- The specified behavior for all combinations of inputs is complete and covers all possible input states.

MSB/LSB Conventions:
- Since all signals are 1-bit, there is no need for MSB/LSB indexing.

The module should be implemented to directly reflect the described input-output relationship as derived from the waveform.
