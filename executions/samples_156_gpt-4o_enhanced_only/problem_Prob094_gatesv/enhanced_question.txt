Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `in`: A 4-bit wide input vector where `in[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `out_both`: A 4-bit wide output vector. Only `out_both[2:0]` are relevant, as described below.
  - `out_any`: A 4-bit wide output vector. Only `out_any[3:1]` are relevant, as described below.
  - `out_different`: A 4-bit wide output vector. All bits are relevant, with a wrapping neighbor relationship, as described below.

Functional Description:
- `out_both`: This output vector indicates pairs of bits where both the current bit and the neighbor to its left (higher index) are '1'. Specifically:
  - `out_both[2]` = 1 if both `in[2]` and `in[3]` are '1'.
  - `out_both[1]` = 1 if both `in[1]` and `in[2]` are '1'.
  - `out_both[0]` = 1 if both `in[0]` and `in[1]` are '1'.
  - `out_both[3]` is not used.

- `out_any`: This output vector indicates pairs of bits where either the current bit or the neighbor to its right (lower index) is '1'. Specifically:
  - `out_any[3]` = 1 if either `in[3]` or `in[2]` is '1'.
  - `out_any[2]` = 1 if either `in[2]` or `in[1]` is '1'.
  - `out_any[1]` = 1 if either `in[1]` or `in[0]` is '1'.
  - `out_any[0]` is not used.

- `out_different`: This output vector indicates if the current bit is different from its neighbor to the left, wrapping around the vector. Specifically:
  - `out_different[3]` = 1 if `in[3]` is different from `in[0]`.
  - `out_different[2]` = 1 if `in[2]` is different from `in[3]`.
  - `out_different[1]` = 1 if `in[1]` is different from `in[2]`.
  - `out_different[0]` = 1 if `in[0]` is different from `in[1]`.

Signal Characteristics:
- All operations are purely combinational; no clock or reset signals are involved.

- Each bit operation should be evaluated based solely on the current state of the input vector `in`.

- Ensure that the output vectors are correctly initialized to represent the required logical conditions without any ambiguity or race conditions.

Edge Case Considerations:
- The output vectors should correctly handle all possible values of the input vector `in` (ranging from 4'b0000 to 4'b1111).
  
- The wrap-around behavior for `out_different` should be explicitly implemented as described.
