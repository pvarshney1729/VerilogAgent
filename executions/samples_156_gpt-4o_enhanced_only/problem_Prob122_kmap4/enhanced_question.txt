Module Specification: TopModule

Interface Definition:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic a;` // 1-bit input
  - `input logic b;` // 1-bit input
  - `input logic c;` // 1-bit input
  - `input logic d;` // 1-bit input
- Output Ports:
  - `output logic out;` // 1-bit output

Circuit Functionality:
- The module implements the logic derived from the following Karnaugh map, with 'ab' as the column selectors and 'cd' as the row selectors:

```
      ab
 cd   00  01  11  10
 00 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |
 01 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
 11 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |
 10 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
```

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are 1-bit signals.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit in any multi-bit signals; however, all signals in this specification are single-bit.

Operational Description:
- The output `out` is determined by evaluating the combination of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` according to the Karnaugh map provided. 
- The conditions for setting `out` to high ('1') are:
  - (c == 0 && d == 1 && a == 0 && b == 0) || (c == 0 && d == 0 && a == 0 && b == 1) || 
  - (c == 1 && d == 0 && a == 0 && b == 0) || (c == 1 && d == 1 && a == 0 && b == 1)

- The conditions for setting `out` to low ('0') are the inverse of the above conditions.

Additional Considerations:
- The logic is purely combinational with no sequential elements.
- The design assumes ideal conditions without consideration for propagation delays or race conditions typical in logic simulation.
- Edge cases for invalid states are inherently handled as all possible states are defined within the Karnaugh map.

Reset Behavior:
- Not applicable, as there are no sequential elements or stateful logic in this module.
