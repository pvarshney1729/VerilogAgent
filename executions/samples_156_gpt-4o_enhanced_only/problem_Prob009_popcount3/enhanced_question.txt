<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [2:0] in`: A 3-bit unsigned vector where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `output [1:0] out`: A 2-bit unsigned vector representing the population count of '1's in the input vector.

Functional Description:
- The module computes the population count (also known as the Hamming weight) of the 3-bit input vector `in`.
- The population count is defined as the number of bits set to '1' within the input vector.
- The result of this count is provided on the 2-bit output vector `out`. The output range is from 0 to 3, corresponding to the valid number of '1's that can exist in a 3-bit vector.

Operational Details:
- This module performs combinational logic; there is no clock or sequential elements involved.
- There is no need for reset logic as there are no state elements within this module.
- The output `out` is directly dependent on the current value of the input `in` and will reflect any changes to `in` immediately.

Edge Cases:
- As the input is a fixed 3-bit vector, all possible values are inherently within expected operational bounds. No additional handling for edge cases is required beyond the standard 3-bit input range.
