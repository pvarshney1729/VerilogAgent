All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - input  sel_b1\n - input  sel_b2\n - output out_assign\n - output out_always\n\nThe module should implement a 2-to-1 mux that chooses between a and b.\nChoose b if both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are true. Otherwise, choose a. Do the\nsame twice, once using assign statements and once using a procedural if\nstatement.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a: 1-bit input signal.\n  - input wire b: 1-bit input signal.\n  - input wire sel_b1: 1-bit input selection signal.\n  - input wire sel_b2: 1-bit input selection signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out_assign: 1-bit output signal, implemented using continuous assignment.\n  - output reg out_always: 1-bit output signal, implemented using procedural logic.\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. The module functions as a 2-to-1 multiplexer with inputs a and b.\n2. Selection Logic:\n   - The output should select input 'b' when both sel_b1 and sel_b2 are asserted (high).\n   - Otherwise, the output should select input 'a'.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- Continuous Assignment:\n  - Use an 'assign' statement to drive the 'out_assign' output based on the selection logic.\n- Procedural Logic:\n  - Use an 'always' block with an 'if' statement to drive the 'out_always' output based on the selection logic.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- All inputs and outputs are active high.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit of any multi-bit signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that if sel_b1 or sel_b2 is not asserted (low), the output defaults to selecting input 'a'.\n\nReset and Initialization:\n- This module does not include any state-holding elements requiring reset behavior.\n\nDependencies and Timing:\n- The design is purely combinational and does not depend on any clock or reset signals.\n\nConstraints:\n- The module should be implemented to avoid any timing violations or race conditions.\n                    "
