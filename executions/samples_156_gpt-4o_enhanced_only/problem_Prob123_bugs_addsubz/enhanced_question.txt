Consider the following adder-subtractor with a zero flag:

The module is written in Verilog 2001 standard and is designed to perform addition or subtraction on two 8-bit unsigned inputs, `a` and `b`. It outputs the result of the operation and a flag indicating if the result is zero.

Module Name: `TopModule`

Ports:
- `input wire do_sub`: A 1-bit control signal. When `do_sub` is 0, the module performs addition; when `do_sub` is 1, it performs subtraction.
- `input wire [7:0] a`: An 8-bit unsigned operand.
- `input wire [7:0] b`: An 8-bit unsigned operand.
- `output reg [7:0] out`: An 8-bit register that holds the result of the operation.
- `output reg result_is_zero`: A 1-bit register that indicates if the result `out` is zero.

Operational Details:
- The addition and subtraction operations are combinational and are executed based on the value of `do_sub`.
- The result of addition is computed as `out = a + b` when `do_sub` is 0.
- The result of subtraction is computed as `out = a - b` when `do_sub` is 1.
- The zero flag `result_is_zero` is set to 1 if the output `out` is zero after the operation. Otherwise, it is set to 0. This check is performed using a bitwise NOT operation: `if (~|out) result_is_zero = 1'b1; else result_is_zero = 1'b0;`.
- Ensure that all operations are performed considering the most significant bit (MSB) as bit[7] and the least significant bit (LSB) as bit[0].

Edge Cases:
- Handle potential overflow and underflow conditions gracefully since the design assumes unsigned arithmetic.
- Ensure that the `result_is_zero` flag is correctly updated for both addition and subtraction operations.

Reset Conditions:
- As this is a purely combinational module, there are no defined reset conditions for registers since no sequential logic elements are used.

This specification provides a clear and precise description of the intended behavior of the adder-subtractor module, ensuring correct implementation in Verilog.
