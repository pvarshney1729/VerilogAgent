Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset.
  - `input wire in`: Serial data input.
  
- Outputs:
  - `output reg disc`: Asserted for one cycle when a bit needs to be discarded.
  - `output reg flag`: Asserted for one cycle when a flag sequence is detected.
  - `output reg err`: Asserted for one cycle when an error condition is detected.
  
Port Widths:
- All inputs and outputs are 1-bit wide.

Bit Indexing:
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.

Operation Description:
- The module implements a synchronous HDLC framing protocol to decode a serial data stream and detect specific bit patterns using a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM).

Finite State Machine (FSM) States:
- Initial State: The FSM starts in the initial state upon reset, as if the previous input was '0'.
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.

Pattern Recognition:
1. Bit pattern `0111110`: Recognize as a discard sequence. Assert `disc` for one cycle following the detection.
2. Bit pattern `01111110`: Recognize as a flag sequence indicating frame boundaries. Assert `flag` for one cycle following the detection.
3. Bit pattern `01111111...`: Recognize as an error condition (7 or more consecutive '1's). Assert `err` for one cycle following the detection.

Reset Behavior:
- The FSM should reset to the initial state when `reset` is asserted high during a clock cycle. All outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are deasserted during reset.

Output Timing:
- Outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be asserted for a full clock cycle, starting on the cycle immediately after the condition is detected.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM must handle transitions between patterns without missing any valid sequences, ensuring that outputs are correctly asserted for boundary conditions and transitions.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.

Special Considerations:
- Ensure no race conditions occur by strictly adhering to synchronous design principles.
- Properly handle input sequences that include transitions from one pattern to another without intermediate reset.

Note: The FSM design will require careful state management to ensure precise pattern recognition and response timing.
