Module Specification: TopModule

**Port Definitions:**
- Input: `in` (1-bit, unsigned)
- Input: `state` (2-bit, unsigned)
- Output: `next_state` (2-bit, unsigned)
- Output: `out` (1-bit, unsigned)

**State Encoding:**
- State A: 2'b00
- State B: 2'b01
- State C: 2'b10
- State D: 2'b11

**Combinational Logic:**
This module implements a Moore state machine with four states and one input. The logic computes the `next_state` and `out` based on the current `state` and the input `in`. The state transitions and output are governed by the following table:

| Current State | Next State (in = 0) | Next State (in = 1) | Output |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| A (2'b00)     | A (2'b00)           | B (2'b01)           | 0      |
| B (2'b01)     | C (2'b10)           | B (2'b01)           | 0      |
| C (2'b10)     | A (2'b00)           | D (2'b11)           | 0      |
| D (2'b11)     | C (2'b10)           | B (2'b01)           | 1      |

**Implementation Notes:**
- The logic for `next_state` should be derived from the current `state` and input `in` following the transition table.
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current `state` and should not depend on `in`.
- All operations and transitions should be considered purely combinational and must not store state information across clock cycles within this module.
- Ensure that the design is free from race conditions by clearly defining the precedence of logic operations.

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Any unspecified behavior for inputs outside the defined states should default to a safe state transition, preferably to state A (2'b00), with `out` as 0.
- Unused state encodings should not affect the operation of the defined state transitions and outputs.
