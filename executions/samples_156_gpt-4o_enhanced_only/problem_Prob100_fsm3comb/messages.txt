All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in\n - input  state (2 bits)\n - output next_state (2 bits)\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement the following is the state transition table\nfor a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states.\nUse the following state encoding: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10,\nD=2'b11.Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the\ncombinational logic portion) for this state machine. Given the current\nstate (state), compute the next_state and output (out) based on the state\ntransition table.\n\n  State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output\n  A     | A, B                             | 0\n  B     | C, B                             | 0\n  C     | A, D                             | 0\n  D     | C, B                             | 1\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification: TopModule\n\n**Port Definitions:**\n- Input: `in` (1-bit, unsigned)\n- Input: `state` (2-bit, unsigned)\n- Output: `next_state` (2-bit, unsigned)\n- Output: `out` (1-bit, unsigned)\n\n**State Encoding:**\n- State A: 2'b00\n- State B: 2'b01\n- State C: 2'b10\n- State D: 2'b11\n\n**Combinational Logic:**\nThis module implements a Moore state machine with four states and one input. The logic computes the `next_state` and `out` based on the current `state` and the input `in`. The state transitions and output are governed by the following table:\n\n| Current State | Next State (in = 0) | Next State (in = 1) | Output |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|\n| A (2'b00)     | A (2'b00)           | B (2'b01)           | 0      |\n| B (2'b01)     | C (2'b10)           | B (2'b01)           | 0      |\n| C (2'b10)     | A (2'b00)           | D (2'b11)           | 0      |\n| D (2'b11)     | C (2'b10)           | B (2'b01)           | 1      |\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- The logic for `next_state` should be derived from the current `state` and input `in` following the transition table.\n- The output `out` is determined solely by the current `state` and should not depend on `in`.\n- All operations and transitions should be considered purely combinational and must not store state information across clock cycles within this module.\n- Ensure that the design is free from race conditions by clearly defining the precedence of logic operations.\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n- Any unspecified behavior for inputs outside the defined states should default to a safe state transition, preferably to state A (2'b00), with `out` as 0.\n- Unused state encodings should not affect the operation of the defined state transitions and outputs.\n                    "
