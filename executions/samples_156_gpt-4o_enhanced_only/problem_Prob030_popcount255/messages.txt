All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in  (255 bits)\n - output out (  8 bits)\n\nA \"population count\" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input\nvector. The module should implement a population count circuit for a\n255-bit input vector.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire [254:0] in` : A 255-bit wide input vector where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[254]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [7:0] out` : An 8-bit wide output vector representing the population count of '1's in the input vector `in`.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a \"population count\" circuit that counts the number of '1's present in the 255-bit input vector `in`.\n- The result of this count is provided on the 8-bit output port `out`.\n\nDesign Considerations:\n- Combinational Logic: The population count should be implemented using purely combinational logic, ensuring that the output `out` reflects the count immediately based on the current state of the input `in`.\n  \n- Edge Cases:\n  - If the input vector `in` contains all zeros (`255'b0`), the output `out` should be `8'b00000000`.\n  - If the input vector `in` contains all ones (`255'b1`), the output `out` should be `8'b11111111` (since 255 is the maximum count representable by the 8-bit output).\n\n- Input and Output Naming Conventions:\n  - All ports use lowercase with underscores if needed; vectors are defined with explicit width and bit indexing.\n\n- There are no clock, reset, or sequential elements in this design as the circuit is fully combinational.\n                    "
