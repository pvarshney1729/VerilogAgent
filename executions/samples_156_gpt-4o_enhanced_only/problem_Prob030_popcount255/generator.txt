Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` that performs a population count on a 255-bit input vector and outputs the count in an 8-bit output.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [254:0] in,
    output logic [7:0]   out
);

    always @(*) begin
        integer i;
        out = 8'b0; // Initialize the output to zero
        for (i = 0; i < 255; i = i + 1) begin
            out = out + in[i]; // Count the number of '1's
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation

1. **Module Definition**: The module is named `TopModule` with a 255-bit input `in` and an 8-bit output `out`.

2. **Combinational Logic**: The combinational logic is implemented using an `always @(*)` block to ensure that the logic is evaluated whenever there is a change in the input vector `in`.

3. **Bit Counting**: 
   - An integer `i` is used to iterate over each bit of the input vector `in`.
   - The output `out` is initialized to zero at the beginning of the logic block.
   - For each bit in the input vector, the count is incremented by the value of the bit (`in[i]`), which will be either '0' or '1'.

This implementation ensures that the output `out` always contains the correct population count of '1's in the input vector `in`.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input  logic [254:0] in,
    output logic [7:0]   out
);

    always @(*) begin
        integer i;
        out = 8'b0; // Initialize the output to zero
        for (i = 0; i < 255; i = i + 1) begin
            out = out + in[i]; // Count the number of '1's
        end
    end
