All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  y (3 bits)\n - input  w\n - output Y1\n\nThe module should implement the state machine shown below:\n\n  A (0) --0--> B\n  A (0) --1--> A\n  B (0) --0--> C\n  B (0) --1--> D\n  C (0) --0--> E\n  C (0) --1--> D\n  D (0) --0--> F\n  D (0) --1--> A\n  E (1) --0--> E\n  E (1) --1--> D\n  F (1) --0--> C\n  F (1) --1--> D\n\nThe FSM should be implemented using three flip-flops and state codes\ny = 000, 001, ..., 101 for states A, B, ..., F, respectively. Implement\njust the next-state logic for y[1]. The output Y1 is y[1].\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the following interface details. The module will model a finite state machine (FSM) with specified transitions and outputs. All input and output ports should conform to the specified bit widths and characteristics.\n\n### Port Specification\n- `input wire [2:0] y`: A 3-bit input representing the current state of the FSM. Bit indexing is MSB-first, with `y[2]` being the most significant bit and `y[0]` the least significant bit.\n- `input wire w`: A 1-bit input controlling state transitions.\n- `output wire Y1`: A 1-bit output representing the state of `y[1]` at any given time.\n\n### FSM Design\nThe FSM consists of six states, labeled A through F, encoded as follows:\n- State A: `y = 3'b000`\n- State B: `y = 3'b001`\n- State C: `y = 3'b010`\n- State D: `y = 3'b011`\n- State E: `y = 3'b100`\n- State F: `y = 3'b101`\n\n### State Transition Table\nThe state transitions based on the current state (`y`) and the input (`w`) are described below:\n\n- **State A (y = 000):**\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State B\n  - `w = 1`: Remain in State A\n- **State B (y = 001):**\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State C\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State D\n- **State C (y = 010):**\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State E\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State D\n- **State D (y = 011):**\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State F\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State A\n- **State E (y = 100):**\n  - `w = 0`: Remain in State E\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State D\n- **State F (y = 101):**\n  - `w = 0`: Transition to State C\n  - `w = 1`: Transition to State D\n\n### Output Logic\n- `Y1` is directly the value of `y[1]`. Thus, `Y1 = y[1]`.\n\n### Implementation Notes\n- The FSM should be implemented using three flip-flops to represent the state `y`.\n- The flip-flops should be initialized to represent State A (`y = 000`) on reset.\n- All state transitions should occur synchronously on the rising edge of a clock signal.\n- The design assumes the reset to be synchronous and active high, initializing the state to A (`y = 000`).\n- Implement only the next-state logic for `y[1]` within this specification. The complete state transitions will be handled using the entire `y` vector.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions in the state transitions by proper sequencing and clock management.\n                    "
