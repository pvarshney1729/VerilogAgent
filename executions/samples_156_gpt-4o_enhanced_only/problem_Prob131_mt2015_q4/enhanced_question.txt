<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module A Specification:
- Implements the boolean function z = (x ^ y) & x, where '^' denotes bitwise XOR and '&' denotes bitwise AND.
- Inputs:
  - x: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - y: 1-bit input, unsigned.
- Output:
  - z: 1-bit output, unsigned.

Module B Specification:
- Described by the following simulation waveform. The behavior follows a specific time-dependent sequence:
  - Inputs and output are 1-bit, unsigned.
  - Initial state at time 0ns:
    - x = 0, y = 0, z = 1.
  - Transition logic based on simulation waveform:
    - When x and y are both 0, z remains 1.
    - When x is 1 and y is 0, z becomes 0.
    - When x is 0 and y is 1, z becomes 0.
    - When x and y are both 1, z becomes 1.

Top-Level Module Specification:
- Inputs:
  - x: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - y: 1-bit input, unsigned.
- Output:
  - z: 1-bit output, unsigned.

- Structural Composition:
  - Contains four submodules: two instances of Module A and two instances of Module B.
  - The first input of all submodules is connected to input 'x'.
  - The second input of all submodules is connected to input 'y'.
  - The output of the first Module A instance and the first Module B instance are connected to a 2-input OR gate.
  - The output of the second Module A instance and the second Module B instance are connected to a 2-input AND gate.
  - The outputs of the OR and AND gates are connected to a 2-input XOR gate.
  - The final output 'z' is the result of the XOR gate.

- Logic Operations and Precedence:
  - Ensure that OR and AND operations precede the XOR operation.
  - All operations are combinational and must adhere to the precedence and associativity of bitwise operations.

- General Specifications:
  - All logic operations and connections are combinational with no clock dependency.
  - No resets are involved, as all operations are purely combinational logic.
  - Ensure propagation delay considerations are addressed in actual implementation, but not specified here.
