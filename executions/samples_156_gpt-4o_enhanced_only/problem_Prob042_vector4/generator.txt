Generated Response:

Certainly! I'll implement the `TopModule` according to the given specifications. The module will perform sign extension of an 8-bit signed input to a 32-bit signed output by replicating the sign bit 24 times.

Here is the Verilog code for the module:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = {{24{in[7]}}, in};
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

**Explanation:**
- The module is named `TopModule` and it has an 8-bit input `in` and a 32-bit output `out`.
- The sign extension is performed using the replication operator. We replicate the most significant bit `in[7]` 24 times and then concatenate it with the original 8-bit input `in`.
- The `always @(*)` block ensures that the logic is combinational and updates `out` whenever `in` changes.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = {{24{in[7]}}, in};
    end

endmodule
