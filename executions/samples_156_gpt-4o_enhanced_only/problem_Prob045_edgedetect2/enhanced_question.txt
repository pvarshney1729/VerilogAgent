<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock input, used to trigger all sequential logic on the positive edge.
  - in: 8-bit input vector (bit[7:0]), where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - anyedge: 8-bit output vector (bit[7:0]), where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Functionality:
- The module detects any transition (rising or falling edge) of each bit in the 8-bit input vector 'in' from one clock cycle to the next.
- For each bit in 'in', if a transition from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 is detected, the corresponding bit in the 'anyedge' output vector should be set to 1 in the next clock cycle.
- The detection of transitions and the setting of the 'anyedge' bits are synchronous to the clock signal.

Reset and Initialization:
- The specification does not mention a reset signal; hence, no reset behavior is defined for this module.
- All initial values of internal logic or state are assumed to be zero unless otherwise specified.

Operational Details:
- Signal changes are captured on the positive edge of the 'clk'.
- The 'anyedge' output reflects the detected transition in the cycle immediately following the detected change in 'in'.
- Ensure no race conditions occur by ensuring operations are synchronized with the clock edge.

Edge Case Handling:
- At initialization or power-up, the detection mechanism should assume that the previous state of 'in' is zero for all bits unless specified otherwise.
- The module should correctly handle rapid input changes and still produce a stable and accurate 'anyedge' output synchronized to the clock.

Note: This specification assumes there is no need for an explicit reset, and all transitions are detected based on the positive edge of the clock.
