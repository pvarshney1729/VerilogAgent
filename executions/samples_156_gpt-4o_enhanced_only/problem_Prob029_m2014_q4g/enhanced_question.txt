Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: 
  - `in1`: A 1-bit input signal.
  - `in2`: A 1-bit input signal.
  - `in3`: A 1-bit input signal.
- Output:
  - `out`: A 1-bit output signal.

Circuit Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The circuit consists of the following components and connections:

  1. A two-input XNOR gate:
     - Inputs: `in1` and `in2`.
     - Output: `xnor_out` (intermediate signal, not an external port).

  2. A two-input XOR gate:
     - First Input: `xnor_out`.
     - Second Input: `in3`.
     - Output: `out` (connected directly to the module's output port).

Signal Description:
- `xnor_out` is the result of the XNOR operation between `in1` and `in2`.
- `out` is the result of the XOR operation between `xnor_out` and `in3`.

Operational Details:
- The inputs `in1`, `in2`, and `in3` are treated as binary values (0 or 1).
- The XNOR gate performs a bitwise operation such that its output is 1 when both inputs are equal and 0 otherwise.
- The XOR gate performs a bitwise operation such that its output is 1 when the inputs are different and 0 otherwise.

Note:
- This module does not contain any sequential logic; it operates purely combinationally.
- There are no asynchronous or synchronous resets, as there are no flip-flops or registers used in this design.
- Ensure the signal propagation from `in1`, `in2`, and `in3` through the gates is handled in accordance with combinational logic timing.
