All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in1\n - input  in2\n - input  in3\n - output out\n\nThe module should impement the following circuit: A two-input XNOR\n(connected to 'in1' and 'in2) has an output connected to the input of a\ntwo-input XOR. The second input of the XOR is 'in3.' The output of the\nXOR is 'out'.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: \n  - `in1`: A 1-bit input signal.\n  - `in2`: A 1-bit input signal.\n  - `in3`: A 1-bit input signal.\n- Output:\n  - `out`: A 1-bit output signal.\n\nCircuit Description:\n- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.\n- The circuit consists of the following components and connections:\n\n  1. A two-input XNOR gate:\n     - Inputs: `in1` and `in2`.\n     - Output: `xnor_out` (intermediate signal, not an external port).\n\n  2. A two-input XOR gate:\n     - First Input: `xnor_out`.\n     - Second Input: `in3`.\n     - Output: `out` (connected directly to the module's output port).\n\nSignal Description:\n- `xnor_out` is the result of the XNOR operation between `in1` and `in2`.\n- `out` is the result of the XOR operation between `xnor_out` and `in3`.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The inputs `in1`, `in2`, and `in3` are treated as binary values (0 or 1).\n- The XNOR gate performs a bitwise operation such that its output is 1 when both inputs are equal and 0 otherwise.\n- The XOR gate performs a bitwise operation such that its output is 1 when the inputs are different and 0 otherwise.\n\nNote:\n- This module does not contain any sequential logic; it operates purely combinationally.\n- There are no asynchronous or synchronous resets, as there are no flip-flops or registers used in this design.\n- Ensure the signal propagation from `in1`, `in2`, and `in3` through the gates is handled in accordance with combinational logic timing.\n                    "
