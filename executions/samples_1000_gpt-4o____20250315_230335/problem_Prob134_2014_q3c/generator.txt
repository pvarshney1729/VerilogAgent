<REASONING>
To implement the FSM as described, we need to create a module `TopModule` with the specified inputs and outputs. The FSM transitions between states based on the current state `y` and input `x`. The next state logic is determined by the table provided, and the output `z` is also specified for each state.

1. **State Encoding**: The current state `y` and next state `Y` are both 3-bit wide signals. We will use a register to hold the current state and update it on the rising edge of the clock.

2. **Next State Logic**: We will use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `x`. This logic will follow the table provided.

3. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined by the current state, and `Y0` is the least significant bit of the next state `Y`.

4. **Synchronous Logic**: The state register will be updated on the rising edge of the clock, implementing a synchronous FSM.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will declare all ports and signals as `logic`, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensure all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

Let's implement the module following these steps.
