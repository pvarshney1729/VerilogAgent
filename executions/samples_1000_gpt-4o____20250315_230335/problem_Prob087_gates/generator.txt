<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a module with two 1-bit inputs, `a` and `b`, and seven 1-bit outputs. Each output corresponds to a specific logic operation between `a` and `b`. The operations are straightforward and can be implemented using Verilog's built-in operators for bitwise logic operations. Since this is a purely combinational circuit, we will use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) to directly map the logic operations to the outputs. This approach ensures that the outputs are always updated in response to changes in the inputs, without the need for an always block.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out_and,
    output logic out_or,
    output logic out_xor,
    output logic out_nand,
    output logic out_nor,
    output logic out_xnor,
    output logic out_anotb
);

    // Assign logic operations to outputs
    assign out_and = a & b;
    assign out_or = a | b;
    assign out_xor = a ^ b;
    assign out_nand = ~(a & b);
    assign out_nor = ~(a | b);
    assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);
    assign out_anotb = a & ~b;
