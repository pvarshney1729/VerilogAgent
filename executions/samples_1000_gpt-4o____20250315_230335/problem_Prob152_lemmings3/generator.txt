To implement the Lemmings behavior using a Moore state machine, we need to define the states and transitions based on the problem description. The states are:

1. WALK_LEFT: The Lemming is walking left.
2. WALK_RIGHT: The Lemming is walking right.
3. FALL_LEFT: The Lemming is falling while originally walking left.
4. FALL_RIGHT: The Lemming is falling while originally walking right.
5. DIG_LEFT: The Lemming is digging while originally walking left.
6. DIG_RIGHT: The Lemming is digging while originally walking right.

The transitions between these states are governed by the inputs: `bump_left`, `bump_right`, `ground`, and `dig`. The priority of actions is:
1. Falling (when `ground` is 0).
2. Digging (when `dig` is 1 and `ground` is 1).
3. Switching directions (when bumped).

The `areset` input is used for asynchronous reset to the WALK_LEFT state.

The outputs are determined by the current state:
- `walk_left` is 1 in WALK_LEFT state.
- `walk_right` is 1 in WALK_RIGHT state.
- `aaah` is 1 in FALL_LEFT and FALL_RIGHT states.
- `digging` is 1 in DIG_LEFT and DIG_RIGHT states.

The implementation will use a state register to hold the current state and a next state logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs. The outputs are directly derived from the state.
