<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as described, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `j` and `k`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, making it a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: We can use a single bit to represent the two states:
   - OFF: 0
   - ON: 1

2. **State Transition Logic**:
   - From OFF (state = 0):
     - If `j` is 0, stay in OFF.
     - If `j` is 1, transition to ON.
   - From ON (state = 1):
     - If `k` is 0, stay in ON.
     - If `k` is 1, transition to OFF.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - When in OFF state, `out` is 0.
   - When in ON state, `out` is 1.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is active-high and synchronous, meaning it will only affect the state on the rising edge of the clock. When reset is high, the state should be set to OFF.

5. **Implementation**: We'll use an always block sensitive to the clock for state transitions and synchronous reset. The output will be assigned based on the current state.

By following these steps, we can implement the desired behavior in Verilog.
