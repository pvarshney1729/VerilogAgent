To implement the Mealy-type FSM that recognizes the sequence "101", we need to define three states. Let's name them as follows:
- `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the first '1' in the sequence.
- `S1`: Indicates that the first '1' has been detected.
- `S10`: Indicates that the sequence '10' has been detected.

The FSM transitions are as follows:
- From `IDLE`, if '1' is detected, move to `S1`. If '0' is detected, stay in `IDLE`.
- From `S1`, if '0' is detected, move to `S10`. If '1' is detected, stay in `S1`.
- From `S10`, if '1' is detected, move to `S1` and assert output 'z' to '1'. If '0' is detected, move back to `IDLE`.

The output 'z' is asserted when the FSM is in state `S10` and the input 'x' is '1'.

The FSM is implemented with a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, which means the reset signal is active low and will reset the state machine to `IDLE` on the negative edge of `aresetn`.

We will use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock for state transitions and output logic. The reset logic will be handled within this block, ensuring the FSM resets to the `IDLE` state when `aresetn` is low.

The FSM will be implemented using a case statement to handle state transitions and output logic.
