<REASONING>
To implement the 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer, we need to select one of the nine 16-bit inputs based on the 4-bit selection input `sel`. The inputs are `a` through `i`, and the output is `out`. The selection is straightforward: if `sel` is 0, `out` should be `a`; if `sel` is 1, `out` should be `b`, and so on up to `sel` being 8, which selects `i`. For `sel` values from 9 to 15, the output should be all ones (16'b1111_1111_1111_1111).

We will use an `always @(*)` block to implement the combinational logic for the multiplexer. This block will use a `case` statement to handle the selection logic based on the `sel` input. The `always @(*)` block ensures that the logic is combinational and will be sensitive to any changes in the inputs.

We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions. The `case` statement will cover all possible values of `sel`, including the default case for when `sel` is between 9 and 15.

No synchronous reset or clock is needed for this purely combinational logic.
