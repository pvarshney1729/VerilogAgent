To implement the state machine, we need to define the states and transitions as per the given state diagram. We will use an enumerated type to represent the states for better readability. The state machine will have six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The output `z` is determined by the current state, where states E and F produce an output of 1, and all other states produce an output of 0.

We will use two always blocks: one for the state transition logic (state table) and another for the state register (state flip-flops). The state transition logic will determine the next state based on the current state and input `w`. The state register will update the current state on the positive edge of the clock, considering the synchronous reset.

The output logic will be implemented using a continuous assignment statement, which will assign the value of `z` based on the current state.
