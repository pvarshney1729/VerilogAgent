<Question>
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  j
 - input  k
 - output out

The module should implement a Moore state machine with two states, two
inputs, and one output according to diagram described below. Reset is an
active-high asynchronous reset to state OFF.

  OFF (out=0) --j=0--> OFF
  OFF (out=0) --j=1--> ON
  ON  (out=1) --k=0--> ON
  ON  (out=1) --k=1--> OFF
</Question>

<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.
</Coding Conventions>

<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. We will use a logic signal to represent the current state. The state transitions are based on the inputs j and k, and the output is determined by the current state. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, which means it will immediately set the state to OFF when areset is high, regardless of the clock. The state transitions will occur on the rising edge of the clock. We will use an always block to handle the state transitions and another always block to determine the output based on the current state.
</REASONING>

        OFF = 1'b0,
        ON  = 1'b1
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= OFF;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            OFF: next_state = (j == 1'b1) ? ON : OFF;
            ON:  next_state = (k == 1'b1) ? OFF : ON;
            default: next_state = OFF;
        endcase
