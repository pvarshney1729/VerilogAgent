<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a state machine that controls the flow rate based on the water level indicated by the sensors. The sensors provide a 3-bit input `s`, where each bit represents the state of a sensor. The outputs `fr2`, `fr1`, `fr0`, and `dfr` control the flow rate valves.

1. **State Representation**: The water level is represented by the sensors:
   - Above `s[2]`: All sensors are asserted (`s[2:0] = 3'b111`).
   - Between `s[2]` and `s[1]`: Only `s[0]` and `s[1]` are asserted (`s[2:0] = 3'b011`).
   - Between `s[1]` and `s[0]`: Only `s[0]` is asserted (`s[2:0] = 3'b001`).
   - Below `s[0]`: No sensors are asserted (`s[2:0] = 3'b000`).

2. **Flow Rate Control**:
   - Above `s[2]`: No flow (`fr2`, `fr1`, `fr0`, `dfr` are deasserted).
   - Between `s[2]` and `s[1]`: Nominal flow (`fr0` asserted).
   - Between `s[1]` and `s[0]`: Increased nominal flow (`fr0`, `fr1` asserted).
   - Below `s[0]`: Maximum flow (`fr0`, `fr1`, `fr2` asserted).

3. **Supplemental Flow Valve (`dfr`)**: This is asserted if the previous water level was lower than the current level, indicating an increase in water level.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: On reset, the system should behave as if the water level is below `s[0]`, asserting all outputs.

5. **Implementation**: Use a sequential always block for state updates and a combinational always block for output logic. The state machine will track the previous water level to determine if `dfr` should be asserted.
