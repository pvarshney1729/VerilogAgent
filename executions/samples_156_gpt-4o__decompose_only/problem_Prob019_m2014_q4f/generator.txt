Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation based on the subtasks and guidelines provided:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Implement the AND gate with in2 input inverted
    assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
[DONE]

This module defines the `TopModule` with two inputs, `in1` and `in2`, and one output, `out`. The output is the result of an AND operation between `in1` and the inverted `in2`, as specified. The use of `logic` for port declarations adheres to the coding conventions provided.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Implement the AND gate with in2 input inverted
    assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
