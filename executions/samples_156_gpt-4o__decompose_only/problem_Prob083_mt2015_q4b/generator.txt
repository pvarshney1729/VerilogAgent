Generated Response:

Based on the waveform provided, we can deduce the logic for the output `z`. The output `z` is `1` when both `x` and `y` are `0` or when both `x` and `y` are `1`. This can be expressed using the logical expression `z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y)`. Let's implement this in a Verilog module:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic x,
    input  logic y,
    output logic z
);

    // Combinational logic to determine the output z
    always @(*) begin
        z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y);
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses combinational logic to compute the output `z` based on the inputs `x` and `y`, following the logic derived from the waveform. The use of `always @(*)` ensures that the logic is evaluated whenever there is a change in the inputs.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input  logic x,
    input  logic y,
    output logic z
);

    // Combinational logic to determine the output z
    always @(*) begin
        z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y);
    end

endmodule
