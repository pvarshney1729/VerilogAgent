Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for `TopModule` based on the provided specifications and guidelines:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic w,
    input  logic R,
    input  logic E,
    input  logic L,
    output logic Q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (L)
            Q <= R;
        else if (E)
            Q <= w;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `w`, `R`, `E`, `L`, and output `Q`.
- **Port Types**: All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.
- **Sequential Logic**: An `always` block is used, triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
- **Load Logic**: If `L` is asserted, `Q` is loaded with `R`.
- **Shift Logic**: If `E` is asserted and `L` is not, `Q` is updated with `w`.
- **Output**: `Q` is declared as `reg` to hold its value across clock cycles, which is necessary for sequential logic.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves as a single stage in an n-bit shift register, with the ability to load a value or shift based on the control signals.

module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic w,
    input  logic R,
    input  logic E,
    input  logic L,
    output logic Q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (L)
            Q <= R;
        else if (E)
            Q <= w;
    end
