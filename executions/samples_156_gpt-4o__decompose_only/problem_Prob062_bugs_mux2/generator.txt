Certainly! Let's implement the corrected version of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer. The original issue was with the output being declared as a single bit instead of 8 bits. Here's the corrected module:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    // Use the select signal to choose between inputs a and b
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
[DONE]

This implementation correctly uses the `sel` signal to choose between the 8-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and outputs the selected 8-bit value on `out`.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    // Use the select signal to choose between inputs a and b
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
