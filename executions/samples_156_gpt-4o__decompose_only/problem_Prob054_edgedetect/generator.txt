Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` that detects positive edges on each bit of an 8-bit input vector and outputs the result in an 8-bit vector.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] pedge
);

    // Register to hold the previous state of the input
    logic [7:0] prev_in;

    // Sequential logic to update the previous state and detect positive edges
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        pedge <= ~prev_in & in; // Detect positive edge: 0 to 1 transition
        prev_in <= in;          // Update previous state
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses a register `prev_in` to store the previous state of the input vector `in`. On each positive edge of the clock, it updates `prev_in` and calculates the positive edge detection by performing a bitwise AND between the negated `prev_in` and the current `in`. The result is stored in the output `pedge`.

    logic [7:0] prev_in;

    // Sequential logic to update the previous state and detect positive edges
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        pedge <= ~prev_in & in; // Detect positive edge: 0 to 1 transition
        prev_in <= in;          // Update previous state
    end
