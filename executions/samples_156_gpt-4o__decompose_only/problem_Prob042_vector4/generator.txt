Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that sign-extends an 8-bit input to a 32-bit output by replicating the sign bit:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    // Sign-extend the 8-bit input to 32 bits
    assign out = {{24{in[7]}}, in};

endmodule
[DONE]

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with an 8-bit input `in` and a 32-bit output `out`. The output is generated by replicating the most significant bit (sign bit) of the input 24 times and concatenating it with the original 8-bit input. This ensures that the sign of the original 8-bit number is preserved in the 32-bit output.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    // Sign-extend the 8-bit input to 32 bits
    assign out = {{24{in[7]}}, in};

endmodule
