Generated Response:

Certainly! Based on the analysis of the simulation waveforms, the output `q` is determined by the expression `(b & c) | (b & d) | (a & d)`. This expression is derived from the truth table provided. Here is the complete Verilog module implementation:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    input  logic c,
    input  logic d,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic to determine the output q
    always @(*) begin
        q = (b & c) | (b & d) | (a & d);
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses an `always @(*)` block to implement the combinational logic for `q`, ensuring that it updates whenever any of the inputs change. The logic expression is derived from the truth table, ensuring that the output matches the specified behavior.

    always @(*) begin
        q = (b & c) | (b & d) | (a & d);
    end
