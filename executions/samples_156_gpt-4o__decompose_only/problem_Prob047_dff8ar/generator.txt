Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for `TopModule` that includes 8 D flip-flops with an active high asynchronous reset. The flip-flops are triggered by the positive edge of the clock, and the output is reset to zero when the asynchronous reset is active.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic areset,
    input logic [7:0] d,
    output logic [7:0] q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 8'b0; // Reset all flip-flops to 0
        end else begin
            q <= d; // Capture input d on the rising edge of clk
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses the `always_ff` block, which is a SystemVerilog construct that ensures the block is used for sequential logic. The asynchronous reset is handled by including `areset` in the sensitivity list, and the reset condition is checked first to ensure that `q` is set to zero when `areset` is high. Otherwise, the value of `d` is captured on the rising edge of `clk`.
