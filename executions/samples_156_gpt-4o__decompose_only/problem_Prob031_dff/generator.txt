Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements a D flip-flop. The module captures the value of the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock `clk` and assigns it to the output `q`.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This code defines a module named `TopModule` with the specified inputs and output. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring that the D flip-flop behavior is correctly implemented. The output `q` is updated with the value of `d` at each positive clock edge.
