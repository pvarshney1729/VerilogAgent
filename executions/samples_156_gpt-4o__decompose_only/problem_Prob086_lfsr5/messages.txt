All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - output q (5 bits)\n\nA linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few\nXOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR\nis one particular arrangement that shifts right, where a bit position with\na \"tap\" is XORed with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value,\nwhile bit positions without a tap shift right unchanged.  If the taps positions\nare carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be \"maximum-length\". A maximum-length\nLFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is\nnever reached).\n\nThe module should implement a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps\nat bit positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset\nthe LFSR output to 1. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the\npositive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
