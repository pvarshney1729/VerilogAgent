All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  d\n - input  done_counting\n - input  ack\n - input  state (10 bits)\n - output B3_next\n - output S_next\n - output S1_next\n - output Count_next\n - output Wait_next\n - output done\n - output counting\n - output shift_ena\n\nThe module should implement the following Moore state machine with 3\ninput (d, done_counting, ack) and 3 outputs (shift_ena, counting, done).\nUnless otherwise stated in the diagram below, assume outputs are 0 and\ninputs are don't cares.\n\nstate   (output)      --input--> next state\n-------------------------------------------\n  S     ()            --d=0--> S\n  S     ()            --d=1--> S1\n  S1    ()            --d=0--> S\n  S1    ()            --d=1--> S11\n  S11   ()            --d=0--> S110\n  S11   ()            --d=1--> S11\n  S110  ()            --d=0--> S\n  S110  ()            --d=1--> B0\n  B0    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> B1\n  B1    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> B2\n  B2    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> B3\n  B3    (shift_ena=1) --(always go to next cycle)--> Count\n  Count (counting=1)  --done_counting=0--> Count\n  Count (counting=1)  --done_counting=1--> Wait\n  Wait  (done=1)      --ack=0--> Wait\n  Wait  (done=1)      --ack=1--> S\n\nAt reset, the state machine starts in state \"S\". Derive next-state logic\nequations and output logic equations by inspection assuming the following\none-hot encoding is used: (S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, Wait)\n= (10'b0000000001, 10'b0000000010, 10'b0000000100, ... , 10'b1000000000)\n\nDerive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming\na one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output\nlogic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine.\n\nWrite code that generates the following signals:\n\n - B3_next -- Assert when next-state is B3 state\n - S_next -- Assert when next-state is S state\n - S1_next -- Assert when next-state is S1 state\n - Count_next -- Assert when next-state is Count state\n - Wait_next -- Assert when next-state is Wait state\n - done -- output logic\n - counting -- output logic\n - shift_ena -- output logic\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
