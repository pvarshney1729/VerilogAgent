Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module `TopModule` implementing the specified Moore state machine using one-hot encoding. The module includes the next-state logic and output logic as per the given state transitions and outputs.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic d,
    input logic done_counting,
    input logic ack,
    input logic [9:0] state,
    output logic B3_next,
    output logic S_next,
    output logic S1_next,
    output logic Count_next,
    output logic Wait_next,
    output logic done,
    output logic counting,
    output logic shift_ena
);

    // State encoding
    localparam S     = 10'b0000000001;
    localparam S1    = 10'b0000000010;
    localparam S11   = 10'b0000000100;

    localparam Wait  = 10'b1000000000;

    // Next state logic

    assign B3_next    = (state == B2);
    assign Count_next = (state == B3);
    assign Wait_next  = (state == Count && done_counting == 1);

    // Output logic
    assign done       = (state == Wait);
    assign counting   = (state == Count);
    assign shift_ena  = (state == B0) || (state == B1) || (state == B2) || (state == B3);

### Explanation:
- **State Encoding**: Each state is represented by a unique bit in a 10-bit vector, following the one-hot encoding scheme.
- **Next-State Logic**: The logic for determining the next state is based on the current state and inputs (`d`, `done_counting`, `ack`).
- **Output Logic**: The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are determined based on the current state.

This module adheres to the specified interface and implements the state machine as described in the problem statement.
