        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  enable\n - input  S\n - input  A\n - input  B\n - input  C\n - output Z\n\nThe module should implement a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to\nthe memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is \"random\naccess\", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a\n3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8\nD-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The\nshift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0]\n(MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high\nand controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional\ninputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit's behaviour should be as\nfollows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on.\nYour circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and\nmultiplexers. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive\nedge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
