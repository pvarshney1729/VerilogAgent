        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  data\n - output count (4 bits)\n - output counting\n - output done\n - input  ack\n\nThe module should implement a timer with one input that:\n\n  (1) is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,\n  (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,\n  (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and\n  (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.\n\nThe serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101\nis received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits,\nmost-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the\ntimer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine\nasserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and\ndelay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input\nuntil it resumes searching after everything else is done.\n\nThe state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock\ncycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count\n6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal\nto delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until\nit is 0 for 1000 cycles.\n\nWhen the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care\n(whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the\ncircuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and\nwaits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next\noccurrence of the start sequence (1101).\n\nThe circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the\ninput sequence 1101. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume\nall sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
