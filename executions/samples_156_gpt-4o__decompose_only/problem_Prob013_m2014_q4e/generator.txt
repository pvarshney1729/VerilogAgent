Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for a 2-input NOR gate, following the guidelines and conventions provided:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Implementing the NOR gate logic
    assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses the `assign` statement to directly implement the NOR gate logic, which is the negation of the OR operation between `in1` and `in2`. The use of `logic` for the port declarations ensures compatibility with both synthesis and simulation tools.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Implementing the NOR gate logic
    assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
