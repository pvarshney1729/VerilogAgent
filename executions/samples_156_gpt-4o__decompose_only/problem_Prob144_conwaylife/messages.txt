        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  load\n - input  data (256 bits)\n - output q (256 bits)\n\nThe module should implemement a \"game\" played on a two-dimensional grid\nof cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time\nstep, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:\n\n  (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.\n  (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.\n  (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.\n  (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.\n\nThe game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use\na 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16\ntoroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For\nexample, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15),\n(0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by\na length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a\nsub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc.\n\n  (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial\n       state. Active high synchronous.\n  (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.\n\nThe game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle. Assume\nall sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
