Generated Response:

Certainly! Based on the analysis of the simulation waveforms, the output `q` is `1` only when both inputs `a` and `b` are `1`. This behavior can be implemented using an AND gate. Below is the complete Verilog module implementation:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic: q is 1 only when both a and b are 1
    assign q = a & b;

endmodule

    // Combinational logic: q is 1 only when both a and b are 1
    assign q = a & b;

endmodule
