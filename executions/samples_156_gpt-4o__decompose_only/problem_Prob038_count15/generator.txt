Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the 4-bit binary counter as specified:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the current count value
    logic [3:0] count_reg;

    // Sequential logic for the counter with synchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count_reg <= 4'b0000; // Reset the counter to 0
        end else begin
            count_reg <= count_reg + 1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end

    // Assign the current count value to the output port q
    assign q = count_reg;

endmodule

This module implements a 4-bit binary counter with a synchronous reset. The counter increments on each positive edge of the clock and resets to 0 when the reset signal is high. The current count value is output through the 4-bit port `q`.
