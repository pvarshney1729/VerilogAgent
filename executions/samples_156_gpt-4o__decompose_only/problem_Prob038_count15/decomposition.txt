Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (4 bits)

The module should implement a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0
through 15, inclusive, with a period of 16. Assume all sequential logic
is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The reset input is active
high synchronous, and should reset the counter to 0.
