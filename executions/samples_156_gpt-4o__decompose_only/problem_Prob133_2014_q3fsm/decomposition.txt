Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  s
 - input  w
 - output z

The module should implement a finite state machine with inputs s and w.
Assume that the FSM begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below.
The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when
s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the
next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles,
then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle.
Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three
clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s
input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.
Assume reset is active high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
