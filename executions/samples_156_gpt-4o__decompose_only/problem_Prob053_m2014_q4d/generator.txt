Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` as per your requirements:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic in,
    output logic out
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= in ^ out;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk` and `in`, and output `out`.
- **Data Types**: All ports are declared using `logic` as per the coding conventions.
- **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation is performed between `in` and `out`.
- **D Flip-Flop**: The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, updating `out` with the result of the XOR operation.
- **No Reset**: As specified, there is no reset signal in this design. The flip-flop simply updates its state based on the XOR result at each clock edge.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic in,
    output logic out
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= in ^ out;
    end

endmodule
