        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  areset\n - input  predict_valid\n - input  predict_taken\n - input  train_mispredicted\n - input  train_taken\n - input  train_history   (32 bits)\n - output predict_history (32 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a 32-bit global history shift register,\nincluding support for rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush\ncaused by a branch misprediction. When a branch prediction is made\n(predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update\nthe branch history for the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the\ndirection of the youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs\n(train_mispredicted = 1), load the branch history register with the\nhistory after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the\nhistory before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with\nthe actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and\nmisprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence,\nbecause the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is\ncurrently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch\nhistory register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset\nthat resets the history counter to zero. Assume all sequential logic is\ntriggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
