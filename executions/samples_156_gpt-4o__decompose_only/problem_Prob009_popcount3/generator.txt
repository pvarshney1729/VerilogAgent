Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the "population count" circuit as per your requirements:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [2:0] in,
    output logic [1:0] out
);

    // Combinational logic to count the number of '1's in the input vector
    always @(*) begin
        out = in[0] + in[1] + in[2];
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses an always block with an implicit sensitivity list (always @(*)) to ensure that the output is updated whenever any of the input bits change. The logic simply adds the three bits of the input vector to produce a 2-bit output that represents the count of '1's in the input.

module TopModule(
    input  logic [2:0] in,
    output logic [1:0] out
);

    // Combinational logic to count the number of '1's in the input vector
    always @(*) begin
        out = in[0] + in[1] + in[2];
    end
