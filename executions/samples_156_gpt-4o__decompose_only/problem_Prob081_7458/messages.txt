        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  p1a\n - input  p1b\n - input  p1c\n - input  p1d\n - input  p1e\n - input  p1f\n - input  p2a\n - input  p2b\n - input  p2c\n - input  p2d\n - output p1y\n - output p2y\n\nThe 7458 is a chip with four AND gates and two OR gates. Implement a\nmodule with the same functionality as the 7458 chip. It has 10 inputs and\n2 outputs. You may choose to use an `assign` statement to drive each of\nthe output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as\nintermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of\none of the AND gates.\n\nIn this circuit, p1y should be the OR of two 3-input AND gates: one that\nANDs p1a, p1b, and p1c, and the second that ANDs p1d, p1e, and p1f. The\noutput p2y is the OR of two 2-input AND gates: one that ANDs p2a and p2b,\nand the second that ANDs p2c and p2d.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
