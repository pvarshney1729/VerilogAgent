Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` that computes the even parity bit for an 8-bit input.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  [7:0] in,
    output parity
);

    // Compute the even parity by XORing all bits of the input
    assign parity = ^in;

endmodule
[DONE]

This module takes an 8-bit input `in` and computes the parity bit by XORing all the bits of `in`. The result is assigned to the output `parity`, ensuring that the parity is even. The use of the reduction XOR operator (`^`) efficiently computes the parity in a single line.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input  [7:0] in,
    output parity
);

    // Compute the even parity by XORing all bits of the input
    assign parity = ^in;

endmodule
