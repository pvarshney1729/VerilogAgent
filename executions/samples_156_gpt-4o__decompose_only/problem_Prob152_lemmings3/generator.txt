Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementing the specified behavior using a finite state machine. The module is designed to handle walking, falling, and digging states for a Lemming, with appropriate transitions based on the inputs.

This module uses a state machine to manage the Lemming's behavior, transitioning between walking, falling, and digging states based on the inputs. The outputs are determined by the current state, ensuring the correct behavior as specified.
