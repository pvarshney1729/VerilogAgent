Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for `TopModule` that adheres to the specified requirements and guidelines:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    input logic [31:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    logic [31:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            out <= 32'b0;
            prev_in <= 32'b0;
        end else begin
            out <= out | (prev_in & ~in);
            prev_in <= in;
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `reset`, and `in` (32 bits), and output `out` (32 bits).
- **Registers**: `prev_in` is used to store the previous state of the input vector `in`.
- **Always Block**: 
  - **Synchronous Reset**: When `reset` is high, both `out` and `prev_in` are reset to zero.
  - **Change Detection**: On each positive edge of `clk`, the module checks for a transition from 1 to 0 in `in` by using the expression `(prev_in & ~in)`. If such a transition is detected, the corresponding bit in `out` is set to 1.
  - **State Update**: `prev_in` is updated with the current value of `in` at each clock cycle.
- **Output Logic**: The `out` register captures and holds the detected transitions until reset.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves as specified, capturing transitions from 1 to 0 and maintaining the output until a reset occurs.
