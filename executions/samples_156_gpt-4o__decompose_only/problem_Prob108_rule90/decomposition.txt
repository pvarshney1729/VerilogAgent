Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk,
 - input  load,
 - input  data (512 bits)
 - output q    (512 bits)

The module should implement Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton
with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a
one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next
state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:

  Left | Center | Right | Center's next state
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1
  1    | 0      | 1     | 0
  1    | 0      | 0     | 1
  0    | 1      | 1     | 1
  0    | 1      | 0     | 0
  0    | 0      | 1     | 1
  0    | 0      | 0     | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one
time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the
system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1]
and q[512]) are both zero (off). Assume all sequential logic is triggered
on the positive edge of the clock.
