Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` that satisfies the given specifications:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic d,
    input logic r,
    output logic q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (r) 
            q <= 1'b0;
        else 
            q <= d;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `d`, `r`, and output `q`.
- **Port Types**: All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.
- **Sequential Logic**: An `always` block is used with `@(posedge clk)` to ensure the logic is triggered on the rising edge of the clock.
- **Synchronous Reset**: The reset `r` is checked inside the `always` block. If `r` is high, `q` is set to `0`. Otherwise, `q` captures the value of `d`.
- **Output Initialization**: The output `q` is initialized to zero in simulation by default due to the use of `logic`.

This implementation ensures that the D flip-flop operates with a synchronous reset, as specified.
