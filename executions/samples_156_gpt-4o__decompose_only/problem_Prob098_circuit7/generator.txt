Certainly! Based on the analysis of the simulation waveforms and the subtasks, the module can be implemented as follows:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic a,
    output logic q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (a == 1'b1) begin
            q <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            q <= 1'b1;
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This implementation uses a simple flip-flop that toggles the output `q` based on the input `a`. When `a` is `1`, `q` is reset to `0`. When `a` is `0`, `q` is set to `1`. This behavior matches the waveform provided, where `q` is initially unknown and then set to `1` when `a` is `0`, and reset to `0` when `a` is `1`.
