Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` that adheres to the given specifications and guidelines:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic reset,
    input  logic j,
    input  logic k,
    output logic out
);

    // State encoding
    localparam logic OFF = 1'b0;
    localparam logic ON  = 1'b1;

    // State register
    logic state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= OFF;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            OFF: begin
                if (j)
                    next_state = ON;
                else
                    next_state = OFF;
            end
            ON: begin
                if (k)
                    next_state = OFF;
                else
                    next_state = ON;
            end
            default: next_state = OFF;
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            OFF: out = 1'b0;
            ON:  out = 1'b1;
            default: out = 1'b0;
        endcase
    end

This module implements a Moore state machine with two states, OFF and ON, and transitions between these states based on the inputs `j` and `k`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as specified. The synchronous reset ensures that the state is set to OFF when `reset` is high.
