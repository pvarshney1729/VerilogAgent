Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for `TopModule` that includes 8 D flip-flops, each triggered by the positive edge of the clock. The module adheres to the specified interface and coding conventions.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] d,
    output logic [7:0] q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk` and `d` (8 bits), and output `q` (8 bits).
- **Data Types**: All ports are declared using `logic` as per the coding conventions.
- **Sequential Logic**: An `always_ff` block is used to describe the behavior of the 8 D flip-flops. The `always_ff` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, and it assigns the value of `d` to `q`.
- **Initialization**: In simulation, the flip-flops will be initialized to zero by default, as per the guidelines.

This implementation ensures that the module functions correctly by capturing the input `d` on the rising edge of `clk` and outputting it as `q`.
