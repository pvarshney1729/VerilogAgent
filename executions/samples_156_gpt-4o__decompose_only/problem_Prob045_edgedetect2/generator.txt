Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` that detects any edge (0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) for each bit in an 8-bit input vector and outputs the result in the next clock cycle.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] anyedge
);

    logic [7:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        anyedge <= in ^ prev_in; // Detect any edge by XORing current and previous input
        prev_in <= in;           // Update previous input with current input
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses a register `prev_in` to store the previous state of the input vector `in`. On each positive edge of the clock, it updates `prev_in` with the current state of `in` and calculates `anyedge` by XORing `in` with `prev_in`. This XOR operation effectively detects any change in each bit of the input vector, setting the corresponding bit in `anyedge` to 1 if a transition occurred.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] anyedge
);

    logic [7:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        anyedge <= in ^ prev_in; // Detect any edge by XORing current and previous input
        prev_in <= in;           // Update previous input with current input
    end
