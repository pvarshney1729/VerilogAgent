Generated Response:

Based on the simulation waveforms provided, the output `q` is `1` when either `b` or `c` is `1`. This can be expressed as a logical OR operation between `b` and `c`. Let's implement the module using this logic.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    input  logic c,
    input  logic d,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic to determine the output q
    assign q = b | c;

endmodule
[DONE]

This implementation uses the logical OR operation to set `q` to `1` when either `b` or `c` is `1`, which matches the behavior observed in the simulation waveforms.
