Certainly! Based on the subtasks and the requirements, here is the complete Verilog module implementation:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic out
);

    // Assign a constant logic low (0) to the output 'out'
    assign out = 1'b0;

endmodule
[DONE]

This module, `TopModule`, has a single output `out` which is always driven to logic low (0). The use of `logic` for the output port is in line with the coding conventions provided. The `assign` statement is used to ensure that the output is continuously driven to 0, as there are no input signals to read or process.

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    output logic out
);

    // Assign a constant logic low (0) to the output 'out'
    assign out = 1'b0;

endmodule
