Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops, one for each clock edge, and a multiplexer to select the appropriate output based on the clock signal.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    logic q_pos, q_neg;

    // Positive edge triggered flip-flop
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_pos <= d;
    end

    // Negative edge triggered flip-flop
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    // Multiplexer to select the output based on the clock edge
    always @(*) begin
        q = clk ? q_pos : q_neg;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses two separate always blocks to capture the input `d` on both the positive and negative edges of the clock. The output `q` is then determined by a combinational logic block that selects between `q_pos` and `q_neg` based on the current state of the clock. This approach effectively simulates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard Verilog constructs.

        q_pos <= d;
    end

    // Negative edge triggered flip-flop
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q_neg <= d;
    end

    // Multiplexer to select the output based on the clock edge
    always @(*) begin
        q = clk ? q_pos : q_neg;
    end
