Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects signed overflow.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [7:0] a,
    input  logic [7:0] b,
    output logic [7:0] s,
    output logic overflow
);

    // Perform the addition and detect overflow
    always @(*) begin
        s = a + b;
        overflow = (a[7] & b[7] & ~s[7]) | (~a[7] & ~b[7] & s[7]);
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses an `always @(*)` block to ensure that the addition and overflow detection are performed combinationally. The overflow detection logic checks for conditions where the sign bit of the result `s` does not match the expected sign based on the inputs `a` and `b`.
