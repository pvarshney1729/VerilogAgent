Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation that addresses the issues identified in the original code. The module ensures that both `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` are properly reset when their respective conditions are not met.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        else
            shut_off_computer = 0; // Reset when not overheated
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived)
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
        else
            keep_driving = 0; // Reset when arrived
    end

endmodule
[DONE]

This implementation ensures that both outputs are correctly set based on the input conditions and are reset when those conditions are not met. This resolves the potential issue of leaving outputs in an undefined state when the conditions change.
