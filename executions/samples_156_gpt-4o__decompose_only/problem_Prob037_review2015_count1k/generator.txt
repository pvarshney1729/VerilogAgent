Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module implementation for the `TopModule` that satisfies the given specifications:

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [9:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the current count value
    logic [9:0] count_reg;

    // Sequential logic for the counter with synchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count_reg <= 10'b0; // Reset the counter to 0
        end else if (count_reg == 10'd999) begin
            count_reg <= 10'b0; // Wrap around to 0 after reaching 999
        end else begin
            count_reg <= count_reg + 1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end

    // Assign the current count value to the output port q
    assign q = count_reg;

endmodule
[DONE]

This module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive, with a synchronous reset. The counter resets to 0 when the `reset` signal is high on the positive edge of the clock. The counter increments on each positive edge of the clock and wraps back to 0 after reaching 999. The current count value is output through the 10-bit port `q`.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [9:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the current count value
    logic [9:0] count_reg;

    // Sequential logic for the counter with synchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count_reg <= 10'b0; // Reset the counter to 0
        end else if (count_reg == 10'd999) begin
            count_reg <= 10'b0; // Wrap around to 0 after reaching 999
        end else begin
            count_reg <= count_reg + 1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end

    // Assign the current count value to the output port q
    assign q = count_reg;
