        "content": "<Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  resetn\n - input  x\n - input  y\n - output f\n - output g\n\nConsider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of\nmotor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and\nproduces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock\ninput called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called\nresetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is\nasserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the\nreset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has\nto set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to\nmonitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three\nsuccessive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock\ncycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y\nhas the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should\nmaintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not\nbecome 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0\npermanently (until reset). Assume all sequential logic is triggered on\nthe positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
