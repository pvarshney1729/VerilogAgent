Generated Response:

Certainly! Below is the complete Verilog module for a half adder named `TopModule`, which takes two 1-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and produces a 1-bit `sum` and a 1-bit `cout` as outputs.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    output logic sum,
    output logic cout
);

    // XOR operation for sum
    assign sum = a ^ b;

    // AND operation for carry-out
    assign cout = a & b;

endmodule
[DONE]

This module uses the XOR operation to calculate the sum of the two input bits and the AND operation to calculate the carry-out. The use of `logic` for port declarations is in line with modern Verilog conventions, and the `assign` statements are used for combinational logic, ensuring that the module is both syntactically and functionally correct.

);

    // XOR operation for sum
    assign sum = a ^ b;

    // AND operation for carry-out
    assign cout = a & b;
