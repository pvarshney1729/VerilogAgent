Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  x   (4 bits)
 - input  y   (4 bits)
 - output sum (5 bits)

Implement a 4-bit adder with full adders. The output sum should include
the overflow bit.
