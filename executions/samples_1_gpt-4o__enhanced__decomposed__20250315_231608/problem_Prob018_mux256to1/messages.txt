        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, is specified with the following interface. All input and output ports are to be considered as follows:\n\n- Input Port:\n  - `in`: A 256-bit wide input vector, with each bit representing a separate input for the multiplexer. The least significant bit (LSB), `in[0]`, represents the first input, and the most significant bit (MSB), `in[255]`, represents the last input.\n  - `sel`: An 8-bit wide input vector, representing the select signal for the multiplexer. This signal determines which bit of the `in` vector is routed to the output.\n\n- Output Port:\n  - `out`: A 1-bit output representing the selected bit from the `in` vector based on the `sel` signal.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module functions as a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.\n- The input vector `in` contains 256 individual data inputs. The selection of which input bit to route to the output `out` is determined by the `sel` input.\n- The `sel` input specifies the index of the `in` vector to be forwarded to the `out` port. When `sel = 0`, the output `out` should be equal to `in[0]`. Similarly, when `sel = 1`, the output should be `in[1]`, and so forth, up to `sel = 255` which selects `in[255]`.\n\nBoundary and Edge Case Behavior:\n- The `sel` input must always be within the range of 0 to 255. Behavior is undefined for values outside this range.\n\nThe design is combinational, meaning that changes to the input signals should be reflected immediately in the output without any clock cycle delay. There are no sequential elements, resets, or initial conditions specified in this module, as it relies purely on combinational logic to achieve the desired functionality.\n                    "
