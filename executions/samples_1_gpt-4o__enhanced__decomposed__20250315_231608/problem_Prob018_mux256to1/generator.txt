<REASONING>
The task is to implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog. The multiplexer will select one bit from a 256-bit input vector based on an 8-bit select signal. The output is a single bit corresponding to the selected input bit. Since this is a purely combinational logic task, we will use an assign statement to directly map the selected input bit to the output. This approach is efficient and straightforward for this type of multiplexer.

The guidelines and coding conventions provided suggest using `logic` for signal declarations and using an `assign` statement for combinational logic. Since there is no need for a clock or reset signal in this purely combinational design, we will not include any sequential logic or reset handling.

The `sel` input is 8 bits wide, which is sufficient to address all 256 bits of the `in` vector, as 2^8 = 256. The `assign` statement will use the `sel` input to index into the `in` vector and assign the selected bit to the `out` output.

The module will strictly adhere to the specified interface and signal names.
