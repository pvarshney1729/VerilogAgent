Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal for the FSM. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
- input wire resetn: Active-low, synchronous reset signal. When asserted low, the FSM enters the reset state.
- input wire x: Input signal from the motor.
- input wire y: Input signal from the motor.
- output reg f: Output control signal for the motor. This is a registered output.
- output reg g: Output control signal for the motor. This is a registered output.

Port Widths and Conventions:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit when discussing multi-bit values.

Reset Behavior:
- The resetn signal is synchronous and active-low. When resetn is asserted (low), the FSM enters the initial state, State A.

State Machine Description:
- The FSM begins in State A when reset is asserted.
- When resetn is de-asserted (goes high), the FSM transitions from State A to a state where output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle after the next positive clock edge.
- The FSM then monitors the input x. If the sequence 1, 0, 1 is detected on successive clock cycles, the output g is set to 1 on the clock cycle immediately following this sequence.

Output g Behavior:
- Once g is set to 1, the FSM monitors input y.
- If y becomes 1 within the next two clock cycles after g is set to 1, then g remains 1 permanently until reset.
- If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently until reset.

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and output updates are based on the positive edge of the clock signal.
- Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have defined initial values upon reset. State A is the default state after reset.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure that the FSM handles all possible sequences of x and y correctly.
- Verify behavior when inputs are held constant or change rapidly, especially during boundary conditions of state transitions.
