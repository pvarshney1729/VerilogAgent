        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal for the FSM. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n- input wire resetn: Active-low, synchronous reset signal. When asserted low, the FSM enters the reset state.\n- input wire x: Input signal from the motor.\n- input wire y: Input signal from the motor.\n- output reg f: Output control signal for the motor. This is a registered output.\n- output reg g: Output control signal for the motor. This is a registered output.\n\nPort Widths and Conventions:\n- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit when discussing multi-bit values.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The resetn signal is synchronous and active-low. When resetn is asserted (low), the FSM enters the initial state, State A.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The FSM begins in State A when reset is asserted.\n- When resetn is de-asserted (goes high), the FSM transitions from State A to a state where output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle after the next positive clock edge.\n- The FSM then monitors the input x. If the sequence 1, 0, 1 is detected on successive clock cycles, the output g is set to 1 on the clock cycle immediately following this sequence.\n\nOutput g Behavior:\n- Once g is set to 1, the FSM monitors input y.\n- If y becomes 1 within the next two clock cycles after g is set to 1, then g remains 1 permanently until reset.\n- If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently until reset.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions and output updates are based on the positive edge of the clock signal.\n- Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have defined initial values upon reset. State A is the default state after reset.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure that the FSM handles all possible sequences of x and y correctly.\n- Verify behavior when inputs are held constant or change rapidly, especially during boundary conditions of state transitions.\n                    "
