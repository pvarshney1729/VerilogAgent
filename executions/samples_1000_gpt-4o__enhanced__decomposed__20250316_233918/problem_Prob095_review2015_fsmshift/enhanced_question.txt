Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk` (1-bit): Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input reset` (1-bit): Active-high synchronous reset signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output shift_ena` (1-bit): Control signal to enable the shift register.

Module Description:
- This module functions as part of a Finite State Machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.
- The primary function is to enable the shift register for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles upon detecting a specific bit pattern.

Reset Behavior:
- Upon detection of a reset (`reset = 1`), the `shift_ena` output must be asserted (set to 1) for 4 consecutive clock cycles.
- After these 4 cycles, `shift_ena` will be deasserted (set to 0) indefinitely until the next reset condition occurs.

Clock and Reset Specifications:
- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning it affects the state of the FSM on the rising edge of `clk` if `reset` is high.
- Upon reset, all state-holding elements should be initialized to their respective starting states to ensure consistent operation.

Output Behavior:
- The `shift_ena` signal should have a defined logic level at every clock edge, ensuring no undefined or metastable states are present.

Operational Details:
- Ensure that the FSM logic is robust to handle correct operation upon reaching the edge cases, such as immediate repeated resets.
- Proper precedence of operations and state transitions should be defined to avoid race conditions within the FSM.

Indexing and Bit Conventions:
- All signals are assumed to be 1-bit wide unless specified otherwise.
- Ensure all bit operations and signal assignments are clearly defined following the LSB/MSB conventions.

Edge Cases:
- The system should handle consecutive resets correctly, ensuring `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 cycles each time.
- Ensure graceful handling and operation when the bit pattern for enabling the shift register is detected concurrently with a reset.

By adhering to these specifications, the module will ensure predictable and reliable operation within the larger system.
