Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk` (1-bit): Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input reset` (1-bit): Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output shift_ena` (1-bit): Control signal to enable the shift register.\n\nModule Description:\n- This module functions as part of a Finite State Machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.\n- The primary function is to enable the shift register for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles upon detecting a specific bit pattern.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon detection of a reset (`reset = 1`), the `shift_ena` output must be asserted (set to 1) for 4 consecutive clock cycles.\n- After these 4 cycles, `shift_ena` will be deasserted (set to 0) indefinitely until the next reset condition occurs.\n\nClock and Reset Specifications:\n- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning it affects the state of the FSM on the rising edge of `clk` if `reset` is high.\n- Upon reset, all state-holding elements should be initialized to their respective starting states to ensure consistent operation.\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- The `shift_ena` signal should have a defined logic level at every clock edge, ensuring no undefined or metastable states are present.\n\nOperational Details:\n- Ensure that the FSM logic is robust to handle correct operation upon reaching the edge cases, such as immediate repeated resets.\n- Proper precedence of operations and state transitions should be defined to avoid race conditions within the FSM.\n\nIndexing and Bit Conventions:\n- All signals are assumed to be 1-bit wide unless specified otherwise.\n- Ensure all bit operations and signal assignments are clearly defined following the LSB/MSB conventions.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The system should handle consecutive resets correctly, ensuring `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 cycles each time.\n- Ensure graceful handling and operation when the bit pattern for enabling the shift register is detected concurrently with a reset.\n\nBy adhering to these specifications, the module will ensure predictable and reliable operation within the larger system.\n                    "
