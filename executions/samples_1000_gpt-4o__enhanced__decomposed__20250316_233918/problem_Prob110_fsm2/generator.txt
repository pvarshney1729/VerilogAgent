<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `j` and `k`. The module should have an asynchronous reset (`areset`) that sets the state to OFF. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, making it a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: Use local parameters to define the states OFF and ON. OFF is encoded as `0` and ON as `1`.

2. **State Register**: Use a register to hold the current state. Implement an always block with asynchronous reset logic to update the state on the rising edge of the clock or reset it when `areset` is high.

3. **Next State Logic**: Use combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. If the state is OFF, `out` is `0`. If the state is ON, `out` is `1`.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and use `always @(*)` for combinational logic. Ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we can ensure the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions.
