Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named `TopModule` should be implemented with the following interface, where all input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing the state transitions.\n- `input areset`: Asynchronous active-high reset signal, which resets the state to OFF when asserted.\n- `input j`: Input signal used to control state transitions.\n- `input k`: Input signal used to control state transitions.\n- `output out`: Output signal representing the current state.\n\nThe module shall implement a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:\n\n1. **State Definitions:**\n   - State OFF: \n     - Output (`out`) is `0`.\n     - Transitions:\n       - If `j` is `0`, remain in state OFF.\n       - If `j` is `1`, transition to state ON.\n\n   - State ON:\n     - Output (`out`) is `1`.\n     - Transitions:\n       - If `k` is `0`, remain in state ON.\n       - If `k` is `1`, transition to state OFF.\n\n2. **State Encoding:**\n   - State OFF: Encoded as `0`.\n   - State ON: Encoded as `1`.\n\n3. **Reset Behavior:**\n   - The `areset` input is an active-high, asynchronous reset signal.\n   - When `areset` is asserted (`areset = 1`), the state is immediately reset to OFF regardless of the clock.\n   - When `areset` is deasserted (`areset = 0`), normal operation resumes based on the clock.\n\n4. **Clock and Sequential Logic:**\n   - State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - Ensure no race conditions by correctly synchronizing the state transitions with the clock.\n\n5. **Initial State:**\n   - On power-up or after reset, the module should initialize to the OFF state.\n\n6. **Bit Indexing:**\n   - Not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n\n7. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Ensure that asynchronous reset (`areset`) consistently sets the state to OFF from any current state, independent of inputs `j` and `k`.\n\nEnsure all signals and state transitions are clearly and correctly implemented following the specified behavior for the Moore state machine.\n                    "
