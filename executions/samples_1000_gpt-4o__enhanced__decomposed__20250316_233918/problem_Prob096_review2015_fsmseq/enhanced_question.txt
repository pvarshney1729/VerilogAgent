Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, rising edge triggered.
  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset. Ensures all sequential elements revert to their initial state when asserted.
  - `input data`: Input data stream, single-bit width.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg start_shifting`: Single-bit output. Set to 1 upon detecting the sequence "1101" in the input data stream. Remains 1 until the module is reset.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- The FSM searches for the bit sequence "1101" in the input bit stream `data`.
- The FSM must have at least the following states:
  1. IDLE: Initial state. Waits for the first '1'.
  2. S1: Detected the first '1'.
  3. S11: Detected the sequence "11".
  4. S110: Detected the sequence "110".
  5. S1101: Detected the full sequence "1101". Transition to this state triggers `start_shifting`.
  
- State Transitions:
  - IDLE -> S1 on detecting '1'.
  - S1 -> S11 on detecting another '1'.
  - S11 -> S110 on detecting '0'.
  - S110 -> S1101 on detecting '1'.
  - Any mismatch in the expected sequence should reset the FSM to the appropriate state or back to IDLE.

- Output Behavior:
  - Upon reaching state S1101, set `start_shifting` to 1.
  - `start_shifting` remains 1 until the reset is asserted, at which point it should be cleared to 0.

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- All sequential elements are edge-triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The `reset` is synchronous, affecting all FSM states and outputs on the rising edge of `clk` when asserted.
- Initial State: The FSM should start in the IDLE state after reset, with `start_shifting` initialized to 0.

Additional Considerations:
- Ensure there are no race conditions by clearly defining state transitions.
- During synchronous reset, all internal state variables and outputs must revert to their initial values.
- All bit indices follow the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Edge Case Handling:
- The FSM should handle back-to-back sequences of "1101" without requiring a reset in between.
- If `reset` is asserted, the FSM and `start_shifting` should immediately revert to their initial states on the next rising edge of `clk`.
