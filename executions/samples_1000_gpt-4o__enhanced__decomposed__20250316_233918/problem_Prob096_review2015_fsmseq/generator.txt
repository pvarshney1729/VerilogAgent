<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence "1101" in the input bit stream `data`. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
2. **S1**: Detected the first '1'.
3. **S11**: Detected the sequence "11".
4. **S110**: Detected the sequence "110".
5. **S1101**: Detected the full sequence "1101". This state sets `start_shifting` to 1.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. Once the sequence "1101" is detected, the FSM will remain in the `S1101` state, keeping `start_shifting` high until a reset occurs. The reset is synchronous, meaning it will only affect the FSM on the rising edge of the clock.

The implementation will use the following guidelines:
- Use `logic` for all ports and internal signals.
- Use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.
- Use `always @(posedge clk)` for sequential logic with synchronous reset.
- Initialize all states and outputs to zero in simulation.

The FSM will be implemented using a state register for the current state and a combinational block for the next state logic. The output logic will be based on the current state.
