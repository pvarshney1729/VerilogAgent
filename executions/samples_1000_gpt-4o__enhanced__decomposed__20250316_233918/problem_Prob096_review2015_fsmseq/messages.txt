        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, rising edge triggered.\n  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset. Ensures all sequential elements revert to their initial state when asserted.\n  - `input data`: Input data stream, single-bit width.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg start_shifting`: Single-bit output. Set to 1 upon detecting the sequence \"1101\" in the input data stream. Remains 1 until the module is reset.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- The FSM searches for the bit sequence \"1101\" in the input bit stream `data`.\n- The FSM must have at least the following states:\n  1. IDLE: Initial state. Waits for the first '1'.\n  2. S1: Detected the first '1'.\n  3. S11: Detected the sequence \"11\".\n  4. S110: Detected the sequence \"110\".\n  5. S1101: Detected the full sequence \"1101\". Transition to this state triggers `start_shifting`.\n  \n- State Transitions:\n  - IDLE -> S1 on detecting '1'.\n  - S1 -> S11 on detecting another '1'.\n  - S11 -> S110 on detecting '0'.\n  - S110 -> S1101 on detecting '1'.\n  - Any mismatch in the expected sequence should reset the FSM to the appropriate state or back to IDLE.\n\n- Output Behavior:\n  - Upon reaching state S1101, set `start_shifting` to 1.\n  - `start_shifting` remains 1 until the reset is asserted, at which point it should be cleared to 0.\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- All sequential elements are edge-triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The `reset` is synchronous, affecting all FSM states and outputs on the rising edge of `clk` when asserted.\n- Initial State: The FSM should start in the IDLE state after reset, with `start_shifting` initialized to 0.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- Ensure there are no race conditions by clearly defining state transitions.\n- During synchronous reset, all internal state variables and outputs must revert to their initial values.\n- All bit indices follow the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The FSM should handle back-to-back sequences of \"1101\" without requiring a reset in between.\n- If `reset` is asserted, the FSM and `start_shifting` should immediately revert to their initial states on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n                    "
