Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal (positive edge-triggered).
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
  - `in`: 1-bit input data stream.

- Output Ports:
  - `disc`: 1-bit signal, asserted high for one clock cycle to indicate a bit needs to be discarded.
  - `flag`: 1-bit signal, asserted high for one clock cycle to indicate the detection of a frame boundary.
  - `err`: 1-bit signal, asserted high for one clock cycle to indicate an error condition due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.

Operational Details:
- The module implements a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to decode a continuous bit stream and recognize specific bit patterns.
  
Pattern Recognition:
1. **Discard Pattern (0111110):** 
   - This pattern signals that the next bit should be discarded.
   - The `disc` output is asserted high for one clock cycle following the detection of this pattern.

2. **Flag Pattern (01111110):**
   - This pattern indicates the start or end of a data frame.
   - The `flag` output is asserted high for one clock cycle following the detection of this pattern.

3. **Error Pattern (01111111...):**
   - This pattern indicates an error condition due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.
   - The `err` output is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately following the detection of this condition.

Reset Behavior:
- Upon activation of the `reset` signal, the FSM transitions to an initial state, treating the previous input as if it were 0.
- Reset is synchronous with the clock and takes effect on the rising edge.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- The least significant bit is referred to as bit[0].
- The FSM should account for edge cases where input patterns cross boundaries between consecutive clock cycles.

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and output signal assertions are synchronized with the positive edge of the clock.

Output Timing:
- Output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted on the clock cycle following the cycle in which the pattern is detected, ensuring one full cycle of assertion.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM must handle cases where the input patterns overlap or span across clock cycles, maintaining robustness against race conditions.

The implementation should ensure that all outputs are properly de-asserted in states not matching these conditions and that the FSM remains responsive to new input patterns.
