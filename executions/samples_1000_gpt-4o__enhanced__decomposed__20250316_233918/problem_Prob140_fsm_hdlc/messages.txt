Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal (positive edge-triggered).\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n  - `in`: 1-bit input data stream.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `disc`: 1-bit signal, asserted high for one clock cycle to indicate a bit needs to be discarded.\n  - `flag`: 1-bit signal, asserted high for one clock cycle to indicate the detection of a frame boundary.\n  - `err`: 1-bit signal, asserted high for one clock cycle to indicate an error condition due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The module implements a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to decode a continuous bit stream and recognize specific bit patterns.\n  \nPattern Recognition:\n1. **Discard Pattern (0111110):** \n   - This pattern signals that the next bit should be discarded.\n   - The `disc` output is asserted high for one clock cycle following the detection of this pattern.\n\n2. **Flag Pattern (01111110):**\n   - This pattern indicates the start or end of a data frame.\n   - The `flag` output is asserted high for one clock cycle following the detection of this pattern.\n\n3. **Error Pattern (01111111...):**\n   - This pattern indicates an error condition due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.\n   - The `err` output is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately following the detection of this condition.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon activation of the `reset` signal, the FSM transitions to an initial state, treating the previous input as if it were 0.\n- Reset is synchronous with the clock and takes effect on the rising edge.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- The least significant bit is referred to as bit[0].\n- The FSM should account for edge cases where input patterns cross boundaries between consecutive clock cycles.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions and output signal assertions are synchronized with the positive edge of the clock.\n\nOutput Timing:\n- Output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted on the clock cycle following the cycle in which the pattern is detected, ensuring one full cycle of assertion.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM must handle cases where the input patterns overlap or span across clock cycles, maintaining robustness against race conditions.\n\nThe implementation should ensure that all outputs are properly de-asserted in states not matching these conditions and that the FSM remains responsive to new input patterns.\n                    "
