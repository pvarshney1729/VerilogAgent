Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input logic clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing state transitions. \n- `input logic reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- `input logic in`: Input signal for the state machine.\n- `output logic out`: Output signal determined by the current state.\n\nModule Functionality:\nThis module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B. The state transitions and output behavior are defined as follows:\n\nState Definitions:\n- State B: Output `out` is `1`.\n- State A: Output `out` is `0`.\n\nState Transitions:\n- From state B:\n  - If `in` is `0`, transition to state A.\n  - If `in` is `1`, remain in state B.\n- From state A:\n  - If `in` is `0`, transition to state B.\n  - If `in` is `1`, remain in state A.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is active-high and operates synchronously with the clock.\n- Upon receiving a high reset signal, the state machine transitions to state B on the next rising edge of the clock.\n\nInitial State:\n- The state machine initializes to state B when the module is reset.\n\nBit and Signal Conventions:\n- All signals are one bit wide.\n- The most significant bit (MSB) and least significant bit (LSB) are not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n- The state machine output `out` directly reflects the current state output as described above.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Ensure that all transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock.\n- Avoid potential race conditions by ensuring that `reset` is only sampled on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\nThis specification ensures a clear and correct implementation of the required state machine functionality with explicit definitions of input/output behavior, state transitions, and reset conditions.\n                    "
