Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input logic clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing state transitions. 
- `input logic reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- `input logic in`: Input signal for the state machine.
- `output logic out`: Output signal determined by the current state.

Module Functionality:
This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B. The state transitions and output behavior are defined as follows:

State Definitions:
- State B: Output `out` is `1`.
- State A: Output `out` is `0`.

State Transitions:
- From state B:
  - If `in` is `0`, transition to state A.
  - If `in` is `1`, remain in state B.
- From state A:
  - If `in` is `0`, transition to state B.
  - If `in` is `1`, remain in state A.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is active-high and operates synchronously with the clock.
- Upon receiving a high reset signal, the state machine transitions to state B on the next rising edge of the clock.

Initial State:
- The state machine initializes to state B when the module is reset.

Bit and Signal Conventions:
- All signals are one bit wide.
- The most significant bit (MSB) and least significant bit (LSB) are not applicable as all signals are single-bit.
- The state machine output `out` directly reflects the current state output as described above.

Edge Case Handling:
- Ensure that all transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock.
- Avoid potential race conditions by ensuring that `reset` is only sampled on the rising edge of `clk`.

This specification ensures a clear and correct implementation of the required state machine functionality with explicit definitions of input/output behavior, state transitions, and reset conditions.
