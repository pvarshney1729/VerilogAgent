        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit). All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: Active high synchronous reset signal (1 bit). On reset, the FSM enters state A.\n  - `s`: Control input (1 bit) used in state A to determine state transitions.\n  - `w`: Data input (1 bit) used in state B for evaluating conditions over three clock cycles.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `z`: Output signal (1 bit) indicating the result of the FSM evaluation.\n\nFSM Description:\n- The FSM consists of two primary states: A (initial/reset state) and B.\n\n- State A:\n  - Initial state after reset.\n  - The FSM remains in state A as long as `s` is 0.\n  - Transition to state B occurs when `s` is 1.\n\n- State B:\n  - In state B, the FSM monitors the input `w` over the next three clock cycles.\n  - The FSM counts the occurrences where `w` is 1 within these three cycles.\n  - If `w` is 1 in exactly two out of the three cycles, the output `z` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle.\n  - If the condition is not met, output `z` is set to 0.\n  - This evaluation is repeated every three clock cycles in state B.\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - The reset is synchronous, meaning the FSM transitions to state A on the next positive clock edge when `reset` is high.\n  - All sequential elements (e.g., state registers, counters) are initialized to their default states upon reset.\n\nState and Signal Conventions:\n- All states and transitions are controlled by the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- Output `z` is updated in the clock cycle following the evaluation of the three-cycle condition.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- Ensure any state transitions or signal evaluations are free from race conditions by properly synchronizing all signals to the clock.\n- In cases where `s` transitions from 0 to 1 in the middle of a three-cycle evaluation in state B, the FSM should complete the current evaluation cycle before transitioning back to state A.\n- Use minimal states to efficiently implement the specified behavior while maintaining clarity in state transitions and conditions.\n                    "
