To implement the FSM as specified, we need to manage two main states: A and B. In state A, the FSM waits for the input `s` to become 1. Once `s` is 1, the FSM transitions to state B. In state B, the FSM monitors the input `w` over three clock cycles. We need to count how many times `w` is 1 during these cycles. If `w` is 1 exactly twice, we set the output `z` to 1 in the following cycle; otherwise, `z` is set to 0. The FSM then continues to monitor `w` in subsequent three-cycle windows.

The implementation involves:
1. Defining the states using local parameters.
2. Using a state register to track the current state.
3. Implementing a counter to track the number of cycles in state B and another counter to track the number of times `w` is 1.
4. Using synchronous logic to transition between states and update the counters.
5. Generating the output `z` based on the count of `w` values being 1.

The synchronous reset ensures that the FSM starts in state A, and all counters are reset appropriately. The logic is implemented using an always block for the state transitions and another for the output logic.
