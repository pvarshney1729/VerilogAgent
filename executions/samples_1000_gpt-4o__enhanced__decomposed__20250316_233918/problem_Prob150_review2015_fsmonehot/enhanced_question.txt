Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire d`: 1-bit input, represents a binary condition.
  - `input wire done_counting`: 1-bit input, indicates completion of a counting operation.
  - `input wire ack`: 1-bit input, acknowledges the completion of a process.
  - `input wire [9:0] state`: 10-bit input, represents the current state using a one-hot encoding.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire B3_next`: 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is B3.
  - `output wire S_next`: 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is S.
  - `output wire S1_next`: 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is S1.
  - `output wire Count_next`: 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is Count.
  - `output wire Wait_next`: 1-bit output, asserted when the next state is Wait.
  - `output wire done`: 1-bit output, indicates the done condition.
  - `output wire counting`: 1-bit output, indicates the counting condition.
  - `output wire shift_ena`: 1-bit output, indicates when shifting is enabled.

State Encoding:
- One-hot encoding for states is assumed as follows:
  - S = 10'b0000000001
  - S1 = 10'b0000000010
  - S11 = 10'b0000000100
  - S110 = 10'b0000001000
  - B0 = 10'b0000010000
  - B1 = 10'b0000100000
  - B2 = 10'b0001000000
  - B3 = 10'b0010000000
  - Count = 10'b0100000000
  - Wait = 10'b1000000000

State Machine:
- Initial State on Reset: The state machine starts in state "S" (10'b0000000001). Reset is synchronous.
- The state transitions are based on inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack` with outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` as described below:

1. S (current state):
   - `d=0`: Remain in S
   - `d=1`: Transition to S1

2. S1 (current state):
   - `d=0`: Transition to S
   - `d=1`: Transition to S11

3. S11 (current state):
   - `d=0`: Transition to S110
   - `d=1`: Remain in S11

4. S110 (current state):
   - `d=0`: Transition to S
   - `d=1`: Transition to B0

5. B0 (current state):
   - Always transition to B1, `shift_ena=1`

6. B1 (current state):
   - Always transition to B2, `shift_ena=1`

7. B2 (current state):
   - Always transition to B3, `shift_ena=1`

8. B3 (current state):
   - Always transition to Count, `shift_ena=1`

9. Count (current state):
   - `done_counting=0`: Remain in Count, `counting=1`
   - `done_counting=1`: Transition to Wait, `counting=1`

10. Wait (current state):
    - `ack=0`: Remain in Wait, `done=1`
    - `ack=1`: Transition to S, `done=1`

Output Logic:
- `shift_ena` is asserted in states B0, B1, B2, and B3.
- `counting` is asserted in state Count.
- `done` is asserted in state Wait.

Next-State Logic:
- Generate the next-state signals (`B3_next`, `S_next`, `S1_next`, `Count_next`, `Wait_next`) based on the current state and inputs as per the transitions described above.

Note: Ensure that the implementation handles edge cases and input boundaries as per the state machine design.
