To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Interface**: Define the module with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is `q`, which is 5 bits wide.

2. **Internal State**: Use a 5-bit register to hold the current state of the LFSR. This register will be updated on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the LFSR state to `00001` when `reset` is high. This ensures that the LFSR starts from a known state.

4. **Feedback Logic**: Implement the feedback logic for the Galois LFSR. The feedback is applied to the MSB (`q[4]`) by XORing the LSB (`q[0]`) with the bit at the tap position (`q[2]`).

5. **Shift Logic**: Implement the right shift logic for the LFSR. Each bit in the LFSR is shifted to the right, except for the MSB, which is determined by the feedback logic.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the coding conventions provided, such as using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the LFSR is implemented correctly and adheres to the given specifications and coding conventions.
