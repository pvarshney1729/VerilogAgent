<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

### Port Definitions
- **input** `clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential operations.
- **input** `reset`: Active-high, synchronous reset signal.
- **output** `q`: A 5-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR. Bit indexing is such that `q[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and `q[4]` is the most significant bit (MSB).

### Module Functionality
The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The LFSR is designed to cycle through `2^5 - 1 = 31` states, avoiding the all-zero state.

#### LFSR Characteristics:
- **Taps**: The LFSR has taps at bit positions 5 (`q[4]`) and 3 (`q[2]`).
- **Shift Direction**: The LFSR shifts right.
- **Tap XOR Operation**: The bit at position `q[2]` is XORed with the LSB (`q[0]`) to determine the next value of `q[4]`.
- **Non-Tap Shift**: Bit positions without a tap shift right unchanged, except for `q[0]`, which is determined by the XOR operation.

### Clocking and Reset Behavior
- **Clock Edge**: All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- **Reset Behavior**: The `reset` signal is synchronous and active-high. When asserted, the LFSR output `q` is set to a binary value of `00001` (decimal 1).
- **Initial State**: Upon reset, the LFSR starts from the state representing the binary value `00001`.

### Signal Dependencies
- The next state of each bit in the LFSR depends on its current state and the result of the XOR operation for the tapped positions.
- Ensure the precedence of the XOR operation is maintained to avoid race conditions and ensure deterministic behavior.

### Edge Cases and Input Boundaries
- The all-zero state should never be reached. If encountered, the LFSR should not remain in this state and must be appropriately designed to cycle back to a valid non-zero state on each positive clock edge after reset.

This specification should be adhered to strictly to ensure the correct and intended functionality of the `TopModule`.
