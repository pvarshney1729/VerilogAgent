Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: clk (1 bit) - Clock signal, positive edge triggered
- Input: reset (1 bit) - Active high, synchronous reset
- Input: in (8 bits) - Data input bus, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit
- Output: done (1 bit) - Indicates completion of message reception

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to detect message boundaries within a continuous PS/2 mouse protocol byte stream. Each message consists of three consecutive bytes, where the first byte is identified by in[3] being set to 1. The FSM will:
1. Continuously monitor the input stream in[7:0].
2. Discard bytes until a byte with in[3]=1 is detected, marking the start of a message.
3. Continue to process the next two bytes sequentially as part of the message.
4. Assert the 'done' output high for exactly one clock cycle immediately after receiving the third byte of a message.

FSM State Transitions:
- Initial State: Wait for a byte with in[3]=1.
- Message Start State: Upon detecting in[3]=1, transition to the next state expecting the second byte.
- Second Byte State: Transition to the final state upon receiving the second byte.
- Third Byte State: Once the third byte is received, assert 'done' for one cycle and return to the initial state.

Reset Behavior:
- On reset (active high), all internal states and outputs are reset to their initial state, with 'done' set to 0.

Clock Relationship:
- All state transitions and outputs are synchronized to the positive edge of the clk signal.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- If reset is asserted during any state, the FSM will return to the initial state.
- The 'done' signal will not be asserted if a reset occurs before the third byte is processed even if the first two bytes have been detected.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon power-up or reset, the FSM starts in the initial state, and the 'done' output is 0.
