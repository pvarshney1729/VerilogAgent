        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: clk (1 bit) - Clock signal, positive edge triggered\n- Input: reset (1 bit) - Active high, synchronous reset\n- Input: in (8 bits) - Data input bus, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit\n- Output: done (1 bit) - Indicates completion of message reception\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to detect message boundaries within a continuous PS/2 mouse protocol byte stream. Each message consists of three consecutive bytes, where the first byte is identified by in[3] being set to 1. The FSM will:\n1. Continuously monitor the input stream in[7:0].\n2. Discard bytes until a byte with in[3]=1 is detected, marking the start of a message.\n3. Continue to process the next two bytes sequentially as part of the message.\n4. Assert the 'done' output high for exactly one clock cycle immediately after receiving the third byte of a message.\n\nFSM State Transitions:\n- Initial State: Wait for a byte with in[3]=1.\n- Message Start State: Upon detecting in[3]=1, transition to the next state expecting the second byte.\n- Second Byte State: Transition to the final state upon receiving the second byte.\n- Third Byte State: Once the third byte is received, assert 'done' for one cycle and return to the initial state.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On reset (active high), all internal states and outputs are reset to their initial state, with 'done' set to 0.\n\nClock Relationship:\n- All state transitions and outputs are synchronized to the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- If reset is asserted during any state, the FSM will return to the initial state.\n- The 'done' signal will not be asserted if a reset occurs before the third byte is processed even if the first two bytes have been detected.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up or reset, the FSM starts in the initial state, and the 'done' output is 0.\n                    "
