Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input, positive edge triggered.
  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous active high reset input.
  - `in`: 1-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output signal.

Module Functionality:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.
- The state transitions and output behavior are defined by the following state transition table:

  | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
  |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
  | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |
  | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |
  | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |
  | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |

- The state machine is initialized to state A when the `reset` signal is high at the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The state machine transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` when the `reset` signal is low.
- The `out` signal is driven directly by the current state, independent of the `in` signal.

Additional Specifications:
- All state transitions and output logic are performed in a synchronous manner with respect to the `clk`.
- Bit Indexing: All inputs and outputs are single-bit, hence bit indexing is not applicable.
- Reset State: Upon the assertion of the `reset` signal, the state machine transitions to state A on the next positive edge of the `clk`.
- All sequential elements (flip-flops) are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- Edge Cases: The behavior of the module is defined for every combination of state and input as per the state transition table.
