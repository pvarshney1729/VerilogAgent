        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit, clock signal (positive edge-triggered)\n  - `resetn`: 1-bit, active-low synchronous reset\n  - `r`: 3-bit vector, request signals from devices (bit[0] = device 0, bit[1] = device 1, bit[2] = device 2)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `g`: 3-bit vector, grant signals to devices (bit[0] = device 0, bit[1] = device 1, bit[2] = device 2)\n\nFSM Description:\n1. States:\n   - State A: Initial state, no grants are active.\n   - State B: Grant for device 0 active (`g[0] = 1`).\n   - State C: Grant for device 1 active (`g[1] = 1`).\n   - State D: Grant for device 2 active (`g[2] = 1`).\n\n2. Reset Behavior:\n   - On the rising edge of `clk`, if `resetn` is low (active), the FSM transitions to state A.\n\n3. State Transitions:\n   - From State A:\n     - If `r[0] = 1`, transition to State B.\n     - Else if `r[0] = 0` and `r[1] = 1`, transition to State C.\n     - Else if `r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, and `r[2] = 1`, transition to State D.\n     - Otherwise, remain in State A.\n   - From State B:\n     - If `r[0] = 1`, remain in State B.\n     - Otherwise, transition to State A.\n   - From State C:\n     - If `r[1] = 1`, remain in State C.\n     - Otherwise, transition to State A.\n   - From State D:\n     - Transition directly to State A (since D is not explicitly mentioned, assuming immediate return to A).\n\n4. Signal Precedence:\n   - Priority is given to device 0 over device 1, and device 1 over device 2.\n\n5. Output Logic:\n   - The output grants `g[i]` are determined by the current state:\n     - In State B, `g[0] = 1`, all other `g[i] = 0`.\n     - In State C, `g[1] = 1`, all other `g[i] = 0`.\n     - In State D, `g[2] = 1`, all other `g[i] = 0`.\n\n6. Implementation Notes:\n   - Use separate always blocks for the state transitions (state table) and the state register (flip-flops).\n   - The outputs `g[i]` can be described using continuous assignment or an always block.\n\n7. Edge Cases:\n   - If multiple request signals are high simultaneously while in State A, follow the priority order: `r[0]`, `r[1]`, `r[2]`.\n\nAssumptions:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n- The initial state after reset is State A.\n                    "
