To implement the 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is `q`, which is 32 bits wide.

2. **State Register**: Use a 32-bit register to hold the current state of the LFSR. This register will be updated on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset mechanism. When `reset` is high, the LFSR state should be set to `32'h1`, ensuring that the LFSR does not enter an all-zero state.

4. **Feedback Logic**: Implement the feedback logic using XOR operations. The taps are at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. In a Galois LFSR, the feedback is applied to the LSB, and the tapped positions are XORed with the LSB to determine their next state.

5. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to update the LFSR state. The feedback logic is applied within this block.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the specified coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and using `always @(*)` for combinational logic.

By following these steps, we ensure that the LFSR operates correctly and adheres to the specified behavior.
