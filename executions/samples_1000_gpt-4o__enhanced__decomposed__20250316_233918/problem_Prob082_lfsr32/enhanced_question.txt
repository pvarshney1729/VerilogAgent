Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit input, serves as the clock signal. All sequential logic operations are triggered on the rising edge of this clock.
  - `reset`: 1-bit input, active-high, synchronous reset. When asserted, it resets the LFSR output `q` to a predefined state.

- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 32-bit output representing the state of the LFSR. Bit indexing follows the convention where `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `q[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB).

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- On each clock cycle triggered by the rising edge of `clk`, the LFSR shifts its contents to the right.
- The taps are located at bit positions 31 (MSB), 21, 1, and 0 (LSB), where bit position 31 is considered the MSB based on zero-based indexing.
- Each bit position with a tap computes its next value by XORing its current value with the LSB output bit `q[0]`.
- Bit positions without a tap simply shift right and retain the value of the bit to their left.
- On assertion of the synchronous reset (`reset` = 1), the LFSR output `q` is reset to the hexadecimal value 32'h1, which implies that only `q[0]` is set to 1 and all other bits are set to 0.

Timing and Initialization:
- All sequential elements are initialized to their reset state on module instantiation or when reset is asserted.
- Ensure correct timing by adhering to the positive edge trigger of the `clk` signal for all state transitions.
- Sequential logic is designed to be free from race conditions.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- Ensure that the LFSR does not enter a state of all zeros since this is a non-functional state for a standard LFSR and could lead to a locked state with no further state transitions.
- The module is expected to cycle through a pseudo-random sequence of states, maximizing the length of the sequence before repetition as determined by the tap positions.

The implementation should thoroughly ensure correct functionality and edge case handling based on the provided specifications.
