        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: \n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input. When asserted, all state-holding elements reset to their initial states.\n  - `in`: 1-bit serial data input.\n\n- Output:\n  - `done`: 1-bit output that indicates a byte has been correctly received.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) for byte detection in a serial communication protocol.\n2. The protocol format includes:\n   - 1 start bit (logic 0)\n   - 8 data bits, sent least significant bit (LSB) first\n   - 1 stop bit (logic 1)\n   - The line is idle at logic 1 when not transmitting data.\n\n3. FSM Operation:\n   - Initially, the FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0).\n   - Upon detecting a start bit, the FSM transitions to capturing the 8 data bits.\n   - Once 8 data bits are captured, the FSM expects a stop bit (logic 1).\n   - If the stop bit is correctly received, the `done` output is asserted high for one clock cycle.\n   - If the stop bit is not as expected, the FSM continues to search for a stop bit before restarting the byte reception process.\n   - The `done` signal is asserted only if a complete byte is correctly received, including the correct stop bit.\n\n4. Reset Behavior:\n   - The `reset` input, when asserted high, synchronously resets the FSM to its initial state.\n   - All internal state registers and outputs are reset to their defined initial conditions on the next positive clock edge when `reset` is high.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n   - Any deviation from the start or stop bit conventions will cause the FSM to return to an idle state and wait for the next valid start bit.\n   - Proper handling ensures no race conditions, as all state transitions and outputs are synchronized to the clock.\n\nThis specification ensures a clear implementation of the FSM for receiving serial data bytes with the defined protocol format.\n                    "
