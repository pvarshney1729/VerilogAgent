Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: 
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input. When asserted, all state-holding elements reset to their initial states.
  - `in`: 1-bit serial data input.

- Output:
  - `done`: 1-bit output that indicates a byte has been correctly received.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) for byte detection in a serial communication protocol.
2. The protocol format includes:
   - 1 start bit (logic 0)
   - 8 data bits, sent least significant bit (LSB) first
   - 1 stop bit (logic 1)
   - The line is idle at logic 1 when not transmitting data.

3. FSM Operation:
   - Initially, the FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0).
   - Upon detecting a start bit, the FSM transitions to capturing the 8 data bits.
   - Once 8 data bits are captured, the FSM expects a stop bit (logic 1).
   - If the stop bit is correctly received, the `done` output is asserted high for one clock cycle.
   - If the stop bit is not as expected, the FSM continues to search for a stop bit before restarting the byte reception process.
   - The `done` signal is asserted only if a complete byte is correctly received, including the correct stop bit.

4. Reset Behavior:
   - The `reset` input, when asserted high, synchronously resets the FSM to its initial state.
   - All internal state registers and outputs are reset to their defined initial conditions on the next positive clock edge when `reset` is high.

5. Edge Cases:
   - Any deviation from the start or stop bit conventions will cause the FSM to return to an idle state and wait for the next valid start bit.
   - Proper handling ensures no race conditions, as all state transitions and outputs are synchronized to the clock.

This specification ensures a clear implementation of the FSM for receiving serial data bytes with the defined protocol format.
