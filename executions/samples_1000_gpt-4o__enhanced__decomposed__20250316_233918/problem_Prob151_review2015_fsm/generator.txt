<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that detects a specific pattern (1101) on the `data` input and then performs a series of operations based on the detected pattern. The FSM will have several states to manage the detection of the pattern, shifting additional bits, waiting for a counting operation to complete, and notifying the user when done.

1. **State Encoding**: We will define states for each step in the process: IDLE, DETECT_1, DETECT_11, DETECT_110, DETECT_1101, SHIFT, COUNT, and DONE.

2. **State Transitions**: The FSM will transition between states based on the input data and control signals (`done_counting` and `ack`). The transitions will be managed in a combinational logic block.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs (`shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done`) will be controlled based on the current state. `shift_ena` will be asserted during the SHIFT state for exactly 4 cycles, `counting` will be asserted during the COUNT state, and `done` will be asserted during the DONE state.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM will be reset synchronously with the clock, setting the state to IDLE and clearing any counters or outputs.

5. **Shift Counter**: A counter will be used to ensure `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 cycles during the SHIFT state.

The implementation will follow the coding conventions and guidelines provided, ensuring correct syntax and behavior.
