        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input  wire clk;              // Clock signal, triggering on the positive edge\n- input  wire reset;            // Active high synchronous reset\n- input  wire data;             // Serial data input\n- input  wire done_counting;    // Indicates completion of counting\n- input  wire ack;              // Acknowledgment signal from the user\n- output reg  shift_ena;        // Enable signal for shifting operation\n- output reg  counting;         // Indicates counting operation is in progress\n- output reg  done;             // Indicates timer completion to user\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. State Machine Initialization:\n   - On an active high synchronous reset, the state machine initializes to the state where it begins monitoring for the input pattern (1101).\n   - All registers and outputs (shift_ena, counting, done) are set to 0 during reset.\n\n2. Pattern Detection:\n   - The state machine continuously monitors the 'data' input for the 4-bit sequence '1101'.\n   - The pattern detection operates on the most recent 4 bits received, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n3. Shifting Operation:\n   - Upon detection of the pattern '1101', the state machine asserts 'shift_ena' for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles.\n   - During these cycles, additional bits are shifted in to determine the delay duration (handled by the data path, not included here).\n\n4. Counting Operation:\n   - After the 4-cycle shift operation, the state machine asserts 'counting' to indicate that it is waiting for the counters to finish.\n   - The state machine remains in this state until 'done_counting' input is asserted high.\n\n5. Timer Completion and User Notification:\n   - Once 'done_counting' is high, the state machine asserts 'done' to notify the user about the timer expiration.\n   - The state machine waits for 'ack' input to become high, indicating that the user has acknowledged the timer expiration.\n\n6. Reset and Restart:\n   - After receiving acknowledgment ('ack' is high), the state machine resets to begin monitoring for the '1101' start sequence again.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The state machine is robust against incomplete or incorrect input sequences by resetting to pattern detection upon any deviation from the expected sequence.\n- The system handles continuous input streams and ensures no race conditions, as transitions are strictly controlled by clock edges and defined inputs.\n\nNote: This specification focuses solely on the finite state machine logic. The data path for counters and comparators is assumed to be implemented separately.\n                    "
