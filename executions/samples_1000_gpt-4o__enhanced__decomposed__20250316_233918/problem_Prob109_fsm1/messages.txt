Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal for sequential logic.\n  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high.\n  - `input in`: 1-bit input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output out`: 1-bit output signal.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n- The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B, where:\n  - State A outputs a logic '0'.\n  - State B outputs a logic '1'.\n\nState Transition Diagram:\n- State B transitions:\n  - Remains in state B when `in` is 1.\n  - Transitions to state A when `in` is 0.\n- State A transitions:\n  - Remains in state A when `in` is 1.\n  - Transitions to state B when `in` is 0.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active high.\n- On activation of `areset`, the FSM transitions immediately to state B, regardless of the current state or input.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- States are encoded as binary values with the following assignments:\n  - State A: 1'b0\n  - State B: 1'b1\n- The initial state after reset is state B.\n- The output `out` strictly depends on the current state, not the input:\n  - `out = 1'b1` when in state B.\n  - `out = 1'b0` when in state A.\n\n- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk` unless overridden by `areset`.\n- Bit indexing convention: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the transition logic handles the asynchronous reset correctly, such that any rising or falling edge of `areset` immediately resets the state to B, regardless of the clock signal.\n                    "
