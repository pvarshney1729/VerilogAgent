<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore machine, we need to follow the state transition diagram provided. The module has two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, not the input.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a single bit to represent the states. Let's assign `0` to state A and `1` to state B.

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and should reset the state to B when high.

3. **State Transition Logic**: 
   - From state B, if `in` is 0, transition to state A; if `in` is 1, remain in state B.
   - From state A, if `in` is 0, transition to state B; if `in` is 1, remain in state A.

4. **Output Logic**: 
   - Output `out` is `1` when in state B.
   - Output `out` is `0` when in state A.

5. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Use an always block for sequential logic to handle state transitions and asynchronous reset.
   - Use another always block for combinational logic to determine the output based on the current state.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the given specifications and coding conventions.
