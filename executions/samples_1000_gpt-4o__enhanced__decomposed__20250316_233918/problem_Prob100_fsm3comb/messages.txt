        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`, with the following interface specifications. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input logic in` : This is the input signal for the state machine.\n- `input logic [1:0] state` : This is the 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine.\n- `output logic [1:0] next_state` : This is the 2-bit output indicating the next state of the state machine.\n- `output logic out` : This is the 1-bit output signal based on the current state.\n\nDescription:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with a single input, a single output, and four distinct states. The states are encoded as follows:\n  - State A: 2'b00\n  - State B: 2'b01\n  - State C: 2'b10\n  - State D: 2'b11\n\n- The state transition and output logic are purely combinational. The state machine operates based on the following state transition table:\n\n  | Current State | Next State when in=0 | Next State when in=1 | Output |\n  |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|\n  | A             | A                    | B                    | 0      |\n  | B             | C                    | B                    | 0      |\n  | C             | A                    | D                    | 0      |\n  | D             | C                    | B                    | 1      |\n\n- The `next_state` and `out` are determined based on the current `state` and the input `in`, following the table above. \n- The logic to determine `next_state` and `out` must be implemented using combinational logic without any sequential elements, as this part of the specification excludes clocked elements.\n- Bit indexing convention: `state[1]` is the most significant bit (MSB), and `state[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- The initial state or reset behavior of the state machine is not specified within this module, as it focuses solely on the combinational logic for state transitions and output determination.\n                    "
