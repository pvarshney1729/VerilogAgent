<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`, with the following interface specifications. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input logic in` : This is the input signal for the state machine.
- `input logic [1:0] state` : This is the 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine.
- `output logic [1:0] next_state` : This is the 2-bit output indicating the next state of the state machine.
- `output logic out` : This is the 1-bit output signal based on the current state.

Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with a single input, a single output, and four distinct states. The states are encoded as follows:
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

- The state transition and output logic are purely combinational. The state machine operates based on the following state transition table:

  | Current State | Next State when in=0 | Next State when in=1 | Output |
  |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
  | A             | A                    | B                    | 0      |
  | B             | C                    | B                    | 0      |
  | C             | A                    | D                    | 0      |
  | D             | C                    | B                    | 1      |

- The `next_state` and `out` are determined based on the current `state` and the input `in`, following the table above. 
- The logic to determine `next_state` and `out` must be implemented using combinational logic without any sequential elements, as this part of the specification excludes clocked elements.
- Bit indexing convention: `state[1]` is the most significant bit (MSB), and `state[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
- The initial state or reset behavior of the state machine is not specified within this module, as it focuses solely on the combinational logic for state transitions and output determination.
