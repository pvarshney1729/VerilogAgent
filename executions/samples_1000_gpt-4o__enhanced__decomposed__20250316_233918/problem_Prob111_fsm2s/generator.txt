To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Module Interface**: We will declare the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports using `logic` data type.

2. **State Encoding**: We will define two states, OFF and ON, using `localparam` for clarity and readability.

3. **State Register**: We will implement a state register to hold the current state of the machine. This will be updated on the rising edge of the clock.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic will be synchronous, meaning the state will be reset to OFF when the reset signal is high at the rising edge of the clock.

5. **Next State Logic**: We will use combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

6. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. We will set the output `out` based on the current state.

7. **Coding Conventions**: We will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

By following these steps, we will ensure that the module behaves as specified and adheres to the provided guidelines and coding conventions.
