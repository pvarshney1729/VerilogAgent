Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input logic clk` : Clock signal. This is the positive edge-triggered clock for the sequential elements.\n  - `input logic reset` : Active-high, synchronous reset signal. Resets the state machine to the initial state (OFF).\n  - `input logic j` : Input signal that determines state transition from OFF to ON.\n  - `input logic k` : Input signal that determines state transition from ON to OFF.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output logic out` : Single bit output representing the current state output. This is a Moore machine, so the output is associated with the current state only.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Type: Moore State Machine with two states: OFF and ON.\n- Initial State: OFF\n- State Definitions:\n  - OFF: Output `out = 0`\n  - ON: Output `out = 1`\n\nState Transitions:\n- From State OFF:\n  - If `j == 0`, remain in state OFF.\n  - If `j == 1`, transition to state ON.\n- From State ON:\n  - If `k == 0`, remain in state ON.\n  - If `k == 1`, transition to state OFF.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous with respect to the clock (`reset` must be active high).\n- When `reset` is asserted, regardless of inputs `j` or `k`, the state machine transitions to the state OFF, and output `out` is set to `0`.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- All signals are treated as single-bit logic values where `logic` represents the bit type used in the module.\n- There are no multi-bit signals, so MSB/LSB conventions do not apply.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure correct operation during reset deassertion and input changes by using proper clock edge synchronization.\n\nOperation Precedence:\n- State transitions and output determinations are based on the current state and input conditions evaluated at the rising edge of the clock.\n\nThere are no race conditions as state transitions are determined by the synchronous clock edge and reset operations are explicitly defined.\n                    "
