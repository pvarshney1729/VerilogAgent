Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, is to implement a Moore state machine with the following interface specifications. It involves combinational logic for state transitions and output logic based on one-hot state encoding.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `in`: 1-bit input signal.\n  - `state`: 4-bit input vector representing the current state using one-hot encoding.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `next_state`: 4-bit output vector representing the next state using one-hot encoding.\n  - `out`: 1-bit output signal.\n\nState Encoding:\n- The state machine uses one-hot state encoding as follows:\n  - State A: 4'b0001\n  - State B: 4'b0010\n  - State C: 4'b0100\n  - State D: 4'b1000\n\nState Transition Table:\n- The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:\n\n  | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |\n  |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n  | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |\n  | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |\n  | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |\n  | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |\n\n- `next_state` and `out` are purely combinational logic derived from the current `state` and input `in`.\n\nSignal Considerations:\n- `next_state` and `out` are updated based on the current `state` and `in` without clock dependencies as this specification covers only combinational logic.\n- Ensure that `next_state` and `out` are determined correctly for all possible one-hot encoded states.\n\nNotes:\n- The initial state is not defined within this specification as it only addresses combinational logic.\n- This specification does not cover sequential logic elements, such as flip-flops or registers, which would require additional clock and reset logic.\n- The handling of invalid or multiple active bits in the one-hot encoded `state` is not specified and should be considered outside this scope.\n                    "
