Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the state machine to state A on the positive edge.
  - `input in`: Single-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output out`: Single-bit output signal.

Design Specifications:
1. State Machine Description:
   - Type: Moore state machine
   - Number of States: 4 (A, B, C, D)
   - Initial State: State A

2. State Encoding:
   - State A: 2'b00
   - State B: 2'b01
   - State C: 2'b10
   - State D: 2'b11

3. State Transition Table:
   - Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output
   - A (00)        | A (00)            | B (01)            | 0
   - B (01)        | C (10)            | B (01)            | 0
   - C (10)        | A (00)            | D (11)            | 0
   - D (11)        | C (10)            | B (01)            | 1

4. Logic Details:
   - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
   - The `areset` signal resets the FSM to state A asynchronously on its positive edge.
   - The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per Moore machine characteristics.

5. Edge Case Handling:
   - Ensure that any input condition not explicitly covered by the state transition table defaults to remaining in the current state with the corresponding output.

6. Clarifications:
   - The `areset` signal has precedence over clock-driven state transitions.
   - All sequential elements should initialize to a defined state upon reset.

Notes:
- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals and states are single-bit or 2-bit.
- Ensure that race conditions are avoided by proper synchronization with the clock and reset signals.
