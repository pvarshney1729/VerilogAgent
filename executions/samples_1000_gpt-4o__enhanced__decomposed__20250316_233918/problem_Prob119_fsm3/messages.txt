        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the state machine to state A on the positive edge.\n  - `input in`: Single-bit input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output out`: Single-bit output signal.\n\nDesign Specifications:\n1. State Machine Description:\n   - Type: Moore state machine\n   - Number of States: 4 (A, B, C, D)\n   - Initial State: State A\n\n2. State Encoding:\n   - State A: 2'b00\n   - State B: 2'b01\n   - State C: 2'b10\n   - State D: 2'b11\n\n3. State Transition Table:\n   - Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output\n   - A (00)        | A (00)            | B (01)            | 0\n   - B (01)        | C (10)            | B (01)            | 0\n   - C (10)        | A (00)            | D (11)            | 0\n   - D (11)        | C (10)            | B (01)            | 1\n\n4. Logic Details:\n   - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - The `areset` signal resets the FSM to state A asynchronously on its positive edge.\n   - The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per Moore machine characteristics.\n\n5. Edge Case Handling:\n   - Ensure that any input condition not explicitly covered by the state transition table defaults to remaining in the current state with the corresponding output.\n\n6. Clarifications:\n   - The `areset` signal has precedence over clock-driven state transitions.\n   - All sequential elements should initialize to a defined state upon reset.\n\nNotes:\n- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals and states are single-bit or 2-bit.\n- Ensure that race conditions are avoided by proper synchronization with the clock and reset signals.\n                    "
