        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Definition:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. Positive edge-triggered.\n  - `in`: 1-bit serial data input.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out_byte`: 8-bit data output, representing the received byte.\n  - `done`: 1-bit signal that indicates a correctly received byte. High when `out_byte` is valid.\n\nOperational Specification:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process a stream of serial bits according to a specific protocol.\n- The protocol includes:\n  - 1 start bit (`0`).\n  - 8 data bits, transmitted with the least significant bit first.\n  - 1 stop bit (`1`).\n\n- FSM Operation:\n  - Upon detecting a start bit (`0`), the FSM transitions to capturing the 8 data bits. These bits form the `out_byte` with `bit[0]` as the least significant bit.\n  - After capturing 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (`1`). If the stop bit is found, the `done` signal is asserted high for one clock cycle, indicating `out_byte` is valid.\n  - If a stop bit is not detected, the FSM waits until a stop bit is detected before resetting to search for the next start bit.\n\n- Clock Cycle Relationship:\n  - All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.\n  - The `done` signal is high for one clock cycle after a valid byte is received.\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - A synchronous active-high reset (`reset=1`) initializes the FSM to its idle state. All internal registers and outputs (`out_byte` and `done`) are reset to zero.\n\n- Edge Cases:\n  - In case of continuous `1`s on `in` (idle state), the FSM remains in an idle state until a start bit (`0`) is detected.\n  - If the input stream is interrupted or malformed, the FSM will wait for a valid start bit to resume operation.\n\n- Input Assumptions:\n  - Data is correctly framed with start and stop bits.\n  - The serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.\n\n- Output Conditions:\n  - `out_byte` is valid and holds the received byte only when `done` is asserted high.\n  - `done` is a don't-care outside the valid byte reception context.\n\nThis specification ensures a robust and clear implementation of the intended functionality.\n                    "
