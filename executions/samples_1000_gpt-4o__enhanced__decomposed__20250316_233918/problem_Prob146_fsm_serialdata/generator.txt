To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a serial bit stream according to a protocol with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The FSM will have the following states: IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP. 

1. **IDLE State**: The FSM remains in this state while waiting for a start bit (`0`). The line is idle when `in` is `1`.

2. **START State**: Once a start bit is detected, the FSM transitions to this state to confirm the start of a byte.

3. **DATA State**: In this state, the FSM captures 8 data bits, shifting them into a register. The least significant bit is received first.

4. **STOP State**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (`1`). If the stop bit is correct, the `done` signal is asserted, and the `out_byte` is valid. If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM waits for a correct stop bit before returning to IDLE.

The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize the state and registers. The `done` signal is asserted for one clock cycle when a valid byte is received. The `out_byte` is only valid when `done` is high.

The implementation uses a shift register to capture the data bits and a counter to track the number of bits received. The FSM transitions are determined by the current state and input conditions.
