The module, named TopModule, should have the following interface, with all input and output ports defined as below:

- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal for synchronization, active on the rising edge.
  - `input wire load` : Control signal for loading initial data into the system.
  - `input wire [511:0] data` : 512-bit wide input data used to initialize the cellular automaton state when load is asserted.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [511:0] q` : 512-bit wide output representing the current state of the cellular automaton.

Functional Description:

1. The module implements Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton. The main operation is the computation of the next state of each cell, based on the XOR of its two current neighbors.

2. The transition rules for each cell (Center) based on its neighbors (Left and Right) are as follows:
   - If Left = 1, Center = 1, Right = 1, then the next state of Center = 0
   - If Left = 1, Center = 1, Right = 0, then the next state of Center = 1
   - If Left = 1, Center = 0, Right = 1, then the next state of Center = 0
   - If Left = 1, Center = 0, Right = 0, then the next state of Center = 1
   - If Left = 0, Center = 1, Right = 1, then the next state of Center = 1
   - If Left = 0, Center = 1, Right = 0, then the next state of Center = 0
   - If Left = 0, Center = 0, Right = 1, then the next state of Center = 1
   - If Left = 0, Center = 0, Right = 0, then the next state of Center = 0

3. Boundary conditions are defined as follows:
   - Assume q[-1] (Left neighbor of q[0]) and q[512] (Right neighbor of q[511]) are both logically zero (off).

4. The system operates as follows:
   - On the rising edge of the clock (`clk`), if `load` is asserted (high), the state of the cellular automaton is initialized with the input data (`data[511:0]`).
   - Otherwise, the state advances by one time step according to Rule 90.

5. Initialization and Reset:
   - The initial state of `q` is undefined until the first load or clock edge operation.

6. The design should ensure that all sequential logic elements are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.

7. No explicit reset signal is provided; ensure the module supports initialization through the `load` signal.

8. The bit indexing convention is such that `q[0]` refers to the least significant bit and `q[511]` refers to the most significant bit.

This specification ensures correct implementation by defining input/output widths, operation rules, and clock cycle dependencies.
