        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. This module is a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with a defined interface and behavior. Below are the specifications for the module:\n\n**Module Interface:**\n- **input clk**: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n- **input reset**: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset signal. When asserted, the FSM resets to State A on the next rising edge of the clock.\n- **input in**: 1-bit input signal determining state transitions.\n- **output out**: 1-bit output signal based on the current state of the FSM.\n\n**FSM Specifications:**\n- **States**: The FSM consists of four states named A, B, C, and D.\n- **State Encoding**: Use binary encoding for states. Assume:\n  - State A is encoded as `2'b00`\n  - State B is encoded as `2'b01`\n  - State C is encoded as `2'b10`\n  - State D is encoded as `2'b11`\n- **State Transition Table**: \n  - **Current State A**: \n    - If `in` = 0, transition to State A\n    - If `in` = 1, transition to State B\n    - Output = 0\n  - **Current State B**:\n    - If `in` = 0, transition to State C\n    - If `in` = 1, remain in State B\n    - Output = 0\n  - **Current State C**:\n    - If `in` = 0, transition to State A\n    - If `in` = 1, transition to State D\n    - Output = 0\n  - **Current State D**:\n    - If `in` = 0, transition to State C\n    - If `in` = 1, transition to State B\n    - Output = 1\n\n**Reset Behavior:**\n- On the assertion of the `reset` signal, the FSM transitions to State A on the next positive edge of the `clk`.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Assume the FSM starts in State A upon initialization.\n\n**Additional Specifications:**\n- The least significant bit (bit[0]) in state encoding represents the lowest binary digit.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions by adhering to the positive edge clocking and synchronous reset behavior.\n- The `out` signal is determined solely by the current state and does not depend directly on the `in` signal.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
