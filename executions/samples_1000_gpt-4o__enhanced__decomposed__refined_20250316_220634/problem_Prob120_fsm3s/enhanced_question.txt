<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. This module is a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with a defined interface and behavior. Below are the specifications for the module:

**Module Interface:**
- **input clk**: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
- **input reset**: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset signal. When asserted, the FSM resets to State A on the next rising edge of the clock.
- **input in**: 1-bit input signal determining state transitions.
- **output out**: 1-bit output signal based on the current state of the FSM.

**FSM Specifications:**
- **States**: The FSM consists of four states named A, B, C, and D.
- **State Encoding**: Use binary encoding for states. Assume:
  - State A is encoded as `2'b00`
  - State B is encoded as `2'b01`
  - State C is encoded as `2'b10`
  - State D is encoded as `2'b11`
- **State Transition Table**: 
  - **Current State A**: 
    - If `in` = 0, transition to State A
    - If `in` = 1, transition to State B
    - Output = 0
  - **Current State B**:
    - If `in` = 0, transition to State C
    - If `in` = 1, remain in State B
    - Output = 0
  - **Current State C**:
    - If `in` = 0, transition to State A
    - If `in` = 1, transition to State D
    - Output = 0
  - **Current State D**:
    - If `in` = 0, transition to State C
    - If `in` = 1, transition to State B
    - Output = 1

**Reset Behavior:**
- On the assertion of the `reset` signal, the FSM transitions to State A on the next positive edge of the `clk`.

**Initial Conditions:**
- Assume the FSM starts in State A upon initialization.

**Additional Specifications:**
- The least significant bit (bit[0]) in state encoding represents the lowest binary digit.
- Ensure that there are no race conditions by adhering to the positive edge clocking and synchronous reset behavior.
- The `out` signal is determined solely by the current state and does not depend directly on the `in` signal.
