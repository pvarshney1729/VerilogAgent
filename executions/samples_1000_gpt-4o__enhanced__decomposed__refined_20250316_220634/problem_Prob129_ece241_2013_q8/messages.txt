Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input  wire clk;            // Clock signal, positive edge triggered\n- input  wire aresetn;        // Asynchronous reset, active low\n- input  wire x;              // 1-bit input signal\n- output reg  z;              // 1-bit output signal, registered\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Type: Mealy-type FSM\n- Number of States: 3\n- State Encoding: Use binary encoding for the three states\n  - State 0: IDLE (Initial state after reset)\n  - State 1: DETECT_1\n  - State 2: DETECT_10\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Reset Type: Negative edge triggered asynchronous reset\n- Reset State: On aresetn assertion (low), the FSM transitions to the IDLE state and output z is set to 0.\n\nClock Domain:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).\n\nFSM Operation:\n- The FSM detects the sequence \"101\" on the input signal x.\n- Output z is asserted (z = 1) when the complete sequence \"101\" is detected, even with overlapping sequences.\n- State Transitions:\n  - From IDLE: \n    - Transition to DETECT_1 on x = 1\n    - Remain in IDLE on x = 0\n  - From DETECT_1:\n    - Transition to DETECT_10 on x = 0\n    - Remain in DETECT_1 on x = 1\n  - From DETECT_10:\n    - Transition to IDLE and assert output z = 1 on x = 1\n    - Transition to IDLE and deassert output z = 0 on x = 0\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all input and output ports are single-bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that on reset, the FSM defaults to IDLE and output z is 0.\n- Overlapping sequences are detected, meaning the FSM can recognize a new sequence starting within a previously detected sequence.\n\nNote: Ensure all registers and sequential elements are initialized appropriately to ensure correct operation after reset.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
