        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, 1-bit width.\n  - `input x`: Control signal, 1-bit width.\n  - `input [2:0] y`: Current state input, 3-bit width, with `y[2]` as the most significant bit (MSB) and `y[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output Y0`: The least significant bit of the next state, 1-bit width (corresponds to `Y[0]`).\n  - `output z`: Output signal, 1-bit width.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following characteristics:\n  - The FSM operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n  - The state transitions occur synchronously with the clock.\n  - The FSM does not explicitly define a reset mechanism; initial state conditions are not specified.\n\n- State Transition and Output Logic:\n  - The FSM transitions between states based on the current state `y[2:0]` and the input `x`. \n  - The state transition table is as follows:\n\n    | Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State `Y[2:0]` when x=0 | Next State `Y[2:0]` when x=1 | Output `z` |\n    |------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|\n    | 000                    | 000                           | 001                           | 0          |\n    | 001                    | 001                           | 100                           | 0          |\n    | 010                    | 010                           | 001                           | 0          |\n    | 011                    | 001                           | 010                           | 1          |\n    | 100                    | 011                           | 100                           | 1          |\n\n- Output `Y0` is derived directly from the next state `Y[0]` and is updated synchronously with the clock.\n\n- Edge Cases and Assumptions:\n  - Undefined present states are not handled within this specification.\n  - Behavior for states other than those listed in the table is undefined and should be treated as don't-care conditions.\n  - The output `z` is determined directly by the current state as per the table, independent of the input `x`.\n\nDesign Considerations:\n- This specification assumes no asynchronous reset exists, implying that the initial state must be defined by the system utilizing this module or handled by additional logic if necessary.\n- Designers should ensure no race conditions occur by maintaining synchronous clock edges for state transitions.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
