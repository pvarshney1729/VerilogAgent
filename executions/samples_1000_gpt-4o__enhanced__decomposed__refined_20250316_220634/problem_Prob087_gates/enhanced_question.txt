The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. This module has a combinational circuit with the following input and output interface specifications:

**Inputs:**
- `input wire a;`  // Single-bit input signal, representing the logic input A.
- `input wire b;`  // Single-bit input signal, representing the logic input B.

**Outputs:**
- `output wire out_and;`  // Single-bit output, result of logical AND operation on inputs A and B.
- `output wire out_or;`   // Single-bit output, result of logical OR operation on inputs A and B.
- `output wire out_xor;`  // Single-bit output, result of logical XOR operation on inputs A and B.
- `output wire out_nand;` // Single-bit output, result of logical NAND operation on inputs A and B.
- `output wire out_nor;`  // Single-bit output, result of logical NOR operation on inputs A and B.
- `output wire out_xnor;` // Single-bit output, result of logical XNOR operation on inputs A and B.
- `output wire out_anotb;`// Single-bit output, result of logical AND between input A and the logical NOT of input B.

**Details:**
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.
- The module is purely combinational, meaning that it does not involve any clock signal or sequential logic. Outputs will change immediately in response to changes in the inputs.
- The operations are defined as follows:
  - `out_and` performs the logical AND operation: `out_and = a & b`.
  - `out_or` performs the logical OR operation: `out_or = a | b`.
  - `out_xor` performs the logical XOR operation: `out_xor = a ^ b`.
  - `out_nand` performs the logical NAND operation: `out_nand = ~(a & b)`.
  - `out_nor` performs the logical NOR operation: `out_nor = ~(a | b)`.
  - `out_xnor` performs the logical XNOR operation: `out_xnor = ~(a ^ b)`.
  - `out_anotb` performs the logical AND of A and NOT B: `out_anotb = a & ~b`.

- No initial values are required for the combinational logic module as it does not involve any sequential elements or state retention.
- The logic levels for inputs and outputs are assumed to be standard binary (0 for low, 1 for high).
- Ensure that any changes in input signals `a` or `b` immediately reflect in the respective output signals, adhering to the behavior of combinational logic.
