Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: 1-bit input signal.
  - input wire b: 1-bit input signal.
  - input wire c: 1-bit input signal.
  - input wire d: 1-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - output wire q: 1-bit output signal representing the result of the combinational logic.

General Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit with the inputs a, b, c, and d, producing an output q.
- This is a purely combinational module, meaning that there are no clock signals, flip-flops, or state elements involved.

Combinational Logic Specification:
- The output q is determined by the following observed truth table:

```
  a  b  c  d  |  q
  ------------|----
  0  0  0  0  |  0
  0  0  0  1  |  0
  0  0  1  0  |  1
  0  0  1  1  |  1
  0  1  0  0  |  1
  0  1  0  1  |  1
  0  1  1  0  |  1
  0  1  1  1  |  1
  1  0  0  0  |  0
  1  0  0  1  |  0
  1  0  1  0  |  1
  1  0  1  1  |  1
  1  1  0  0  |  1
  1  1  0  1  |  1
  1  1  1  0  |  1
  1  1  1  1  |  1
```

- The output q is '1' for the following conditions:
  - When c = 1.
  - When b = 1.
  - When a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, and d = 1.

- The output q is '0' for the following conditions:
  - When a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, and d = 0 or d = 1.

- The logic function can be simplified as:
  `q = (c) OR (b) OR (a AND NOT(b) AND NOT(c) AND d)`

Index and Signal Conventions:
- All signals are 1-bit wide.
- All input and output signals are unsigned.
- Bit indices are not applicable as all signals are single-bit.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The table presents all possible combinations of the 4 input bits, ensuring complete specification coverage.
- Since the module is combinational, there are no timing or sequential dependencies to consider.
