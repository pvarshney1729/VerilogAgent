        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: \n  - clk: 1-bit clock signal, used for triggering all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n  - reset: 1-bit active high synchronous reset signal, initializes the clock to \"12:00 AM\" when asserted.\n  - ena: 1-bit enable signal, increments the clock by one second when asserted.\n\n- Output:\n  - pm: 1-bit signal indicating PM when asserted, and AM otherwise.\n  - hh: 8-bit output representing hours in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format, ranging from 01 to 12.\n  - mm: 8-bit output representing minutes in BCD format, ranging from 00 to 59.\n  - ss: 8-bit output representing seconds in BCD format, ranging from 00 to 59.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indication.\n- The clock is incremented based on the ena signal, which pulses at a rate corresponding to one second.\n- The clk signal is a fast-running clock, and all sequential logic is edge-triggered on its positive edge.\n- The reset signal, when asserted, synchronously resets the time to \"12:00 AM\" and has a higher priority over the ena signal.\n- The reset state for hh, mm, and ss is \"12:00:00 AM\" in BCD format, which is hh = 8'b0001_0010, mm = 8'b0000_0000, ss = 8'b0000_0000.\n- The pm signal is set to 0 for AM and 1 for PM, transitioning at 12:00 PM and 12:00 AM, respectively.\n\nOperational Notes:\n- BCD representation means each digit of hh, mm, and ss is stored separately within the 8-bit width.\n- Bit indexing convention: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Synchronous reset ensures that the clock initializes correctly on the next positive edge of clk after reset is asserted.\n- The clock transitions from 11:59:59 AM to 12:00:00 PM and from 11:59:59 PM to 12:00:00 AM correctly, toggling the pm signal accordingly.\n- Race conditions are avoided by prioritizing the reset signal over the enable signal.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- When hh reaches 12 and if incremented, it should reset to 1.\n- When mm or ss reaches 59 and if incremented, it should reset to 00 and cause the next higher unit to increment.\n- The clock should correctly roll over from 11:59:59 AM to 12:00:00 PM and from 11:59:59 PM to 12:00:00 AM.\n\nExample Initial State:\n- At reset, the time should be set to \"12:00:00 AM\" with pm = 0.\n                    "
