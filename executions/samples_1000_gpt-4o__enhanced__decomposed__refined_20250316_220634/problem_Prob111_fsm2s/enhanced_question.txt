Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: `clk` (1-bit, clock signal)
- Input: `reset` (1-bit, active-high synchronous reset)
- Input: `j` (1-bit, control input for state transition)
- Input: `k` (1-bit, control input for state transition)
- Output: `out` (1-bit, Moore state machine output)

State Machine Description:
- The Moore state machine has two states: `OFF` and `ON`.
- State `OFF` is defined with an output `out = 0`.
- State `ON` is defined with an output `out = 1`.

Reset Behavior:
- The `reset` signal is an active-high synchronous signal.
- Upon activation of `reset`, the state machine transitions to state `OFF`.
- The output `out` is set to `0` during the reset state.

State Transitions:
- From `OFF` state:
  - If `j == 0`, remain in `OFF` state.
  - If `j == 1`, transition to `ON` state.
- From `ON` state:
  - If `k == 0`, remain in `ON` state.
  - If `k == 1`, transition to `OFF` state.

Clock and Timing:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- The output `out` reflects the state of the system and changes in the next clock cycle after a state transition, as per the Moore state machine definition.

Initial State:
- On power-up, the system should be initialized to the `OFF` state with `out = 0`.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All signals are single-bit and do not require bit indexing.
- The least significant bit is bit[0] by default as all ports are single-bit.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure that state transitions are well-defined for all possible combinations of `j` and `k` inputs.
- No undefined states or transitions are present in the state machine.

This specification ensures that the Moore state machine is accurately implemented with clear definitions of state transitions, reset behavior, and output logic.
