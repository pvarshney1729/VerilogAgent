        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.\n  - `input resetn`: Synchronous active-low reset signal. When `resetn` is low, the FSM is in initial state A.\n  - `input x`: Input signal from the motor.\n  - `input y`: Input signal from the motor.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output f`: Control signal for the motor. Set to 1 for one clock cycle after reset is de-asserted.\n  - `output g`: Control signal for the motor. Set according to the FSM logic described below.\n\nImplementation Details:\n\n1. **Clock and Reset:**\n   - All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.\n   - Reset (`resetn`) is synchronous and active low. When `resetn` is low, the FSM transitions to state A regardless of the clock edge.\n\n2. **FSM Behavior:**\n   - **State A (Initial State):**\n     - Remain in State A as long as `resetn` is asserted (low).\n     - Upon de-assertion of `resetn` (high) and on the next positive clock edge, set `f` to 1 for exactly one clock cycle.\n\n   - **State Transition Monitoring:**\n     - After `f` is set to 1, the FSM monitors the `x` input for the sequence `1, 0, 1` across three successive clock cycles.\n     - Upon detecting the sequence, transition to a state where `g` is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.\n\n   - **Monitoring `y` Input:**\n     - Once `g` is set to 1, monitor the `y` input for a value of 1 within the next two clock cycles.\n     - If `y` becomes 1 within this two-cycle window, maintain `g` at 1 permanently until reset.\n     - If `y` does not become 1 within the two-cycle window, set `g` to 0 permanently until reset.\n\n3. **Output Initialization:**\n   - Outputs `f` and `g` should be initialized to 0 during the reset condition (when `resetn` is low).\n\n4. **Bit Indexing:**\n   - All input and output ports are single-bit signals, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:**\n   - Ensure that state transitions are correctly handled on positive clock edges.\n   - Any noise or glitches on the `x` and `y` inputs outside the specified sequences should not affect the FSM behavior.\n\nThis specification ensures the correct implementation of the FSM controlling the motor based on the input signals `x` and `y`, synchronized with the clock signal, and governed by the reset logic.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
