Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic a;`  // 1-bit input
  - `input logic b;`  // 1-bit input
  - `input logic c;`  // 1-bit input
  - `input logic d;`  // 1-bit input

- Output Ports:
  - `output logic out;`  // 1-bit output

Module Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the provided Karnaugh map. It produces the output `out` as a function of the four input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Karnaugh Map:
- The Karnaugh map specifies the relationship between inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and the output `out` as follows:

```
    ab
cd   00  01  11  10
00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
```

- Inputs `a` and `b` are treated as a two-bit binary number representing columns.
- Inputs `c` and `d` are treated as a two-bit binary number representing rows.
- Each cell in the Karnaugh map corresponds to a unique combination of (`c`, `d`, `a`, `b`) and the value within the cell is the output `out`.

Bit Indexing Convention:
- All input and output ports are single bits, with `bit[0]` being the least significant bit.

Design Constraints:
- The implementation should be purely combinational with no sequential elements such as flip-flops or latches.
- The output `out` must stabilize within a single clock cycle of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` being stable.
- No reset logic is required as the module is purely combinational.

Edge Cases:
- As all inputs are binary, consider all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (i.e., 16 combinations) as covered by the Karnaugh map.

Note: Ensure that the implementation adheres strictly to the specified mapping and logic derived from the Karnaugh map.
