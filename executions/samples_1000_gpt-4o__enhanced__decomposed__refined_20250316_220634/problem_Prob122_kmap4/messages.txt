        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input logic a;`  // 1-bit input\n  - `input logic b;`  // 1-bit input\n  - `input logic c;`  // 1-bit input\n  - `input logic d;`  // 1-bit input\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output logic out;`  // 1-bit output\n\nModule Description:\n- The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the provided Karnaugh map. It produces the output `out` as a function of the four input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.\n\nKarnaugh Map:\n- The Karnaugh map specifies the relationship between inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and the output `out` as follows:\n\n```\n    ab\ncd   00  01  11  10\n00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n```\n\n- Inputs `a` and `b` are treated as a two-bit binary number representing columns.\n- Inputs `c` and `d` are treated as a two-bit binary number representing rows.\n- Each cell in the Karnaugh map corresponds to a unique combination of (`c`, `d`, `a`, `b`) and the value within the cell is the output `out`.\n\nBit Indexing Convention:\n- All input and output ports are single bits, with `bit[0]` being the least significant bit.\n\nDesign Constraints:\n- The implementation should be purely combinational with no sequential elements such as flip-flops or latches.\n- The output `out` must stabilize within a single clock cycle of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` being stable.\n- No reset logic is required as the module is purely combinational.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- As all inputs are binary, consider all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (i.e., 16 combinations) as covered by the Karnaugh map.\n\nNote: Ensure that the implementation adheres strictly to the specified mapping and logic derived from the Karnaugh map.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
