Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Inputs:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
  - load: 1-bit, control signal to load the counter.
  - data: 10-bit, unsigned, input specifying the initial count value for the timer. Indexing: bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output:
  - tc: 1-bit, output signal indicating the terminal count condition (i.e., the internal counter has reached zero).

Behavioral Specification:
- The module operates as a countdown timer using a down-counter mechanism.
- Internal Counter:
  - Width: 10 bits, unsigned.
  - Initial State: Undefined, but will be explicitly set when loaded.
  
Operational Details:
1. Clock Cycle Behavior:
   a. On the positive edge of clk:
      i. If load = 1:
         - Load the 10-bit internal counter with the value from the data input.
         - The counter will be set to the data value regardless of its current state, allowing reloading while counting.
      ii. If load = 0:
         - Check the current value of the internal counter.
         - If the counter is greater than 0, decrement the counter by 1.
         - If the counter is 0, maintain its value at 0. The counter does not go negative.

2. Output Signal (tc):
   - Assert tc = 1 when the internal counter reaches 0.
   - Once tc is asserted, it remains 1 until the counter is loaded again with load = 1.

3. Reset Behavior:
   - No specific asynchronous or synchronous reset is defined for this module.
   - The counter is reset implicitly by loading a new value via the load signal.

Considerations:
- Ensure that the input data is correctly interpreted as unsigned for proper counting behavior.
- The behavior of the counter and tc signal must be explicitly maintained across clock cycles to prevent race conditions.
- There is no specified handling for edge cases such as when data is loaded with a value of 0, so it is assumed the counter will immediately assert tc in such cases.
