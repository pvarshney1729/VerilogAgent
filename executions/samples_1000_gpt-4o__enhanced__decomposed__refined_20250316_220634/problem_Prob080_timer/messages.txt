        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Inputs:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - load: 1-bit, control signal to load the counter.\n  - data: 10-bit, unsigned, input specifying the initial count value for the timer. Indexing: bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output:\n  - tc: 1-bit, output signal indicating the terminal count condition (i.e., the internal counter has reached zero).\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n- The module operates as a countdown timer using a down-counter mechanism.\n- Internal Counter:\n  - Width: 10 bits, unsigned.\n  - Initial State: Undefined, but will be explicitly set when loaded.\n  \nOperational Details:\n1. Clock Cycle Behavior:\n   a. On the positive edge of clk:\n      i. If load = 1:\n         - Load the 10-bit internal counter with the value from the data input.\n         - The counter will be set to the data value regardless of its current state, allowing reloading while counting.\n      ii. If load = 0:\n         - Check the current value of the internal counter.\n         - If the counter is greater than 0, decrement the counter by 1.\n         - If the counter is 0, maintain its value at 0. The counter does not go negative.\n\n2. Output Signal (tc):\n   - Assert tc = 1 when the internal counter reaches 0.\n   - Once tc is asserted, it remains 1 until the counter is loaded again with load = 1.\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n   - No specific asynchronous or synchronous reset is defined for this module.\n   - The counter is reset implicitly by loading a new value via the load signal.\n\nConsiderations:\n- Ensure that the input data is correctly interpreted as unsigned for proper counting behavior.\n- The behavior of the counter and tc signal must be explicitly maintained across clock cycles to prevent race conditions.\n- There is no specified handling for edge cases such as when data is loaded with a value of 0, so it is assumed the counter will immediately assert tc in such cases.\n                    "
