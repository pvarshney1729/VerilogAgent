        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input logic clk` : Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input logic reset` : Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n  - `input logic data` : Input data stream, 1-bit.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `output logic start_shifting` : Output signal, set to 1 when the sequence is detected.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n1. The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence \"1101\" in the incoming `data` bit stream.\n2. The FSM operates as follows:\n   - It consists of multiple states, each representing a part of the sequence detection process.\n   - The FSM transitions on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - The sequence \"1101\" is detected when those bits appear consecutively in the data stream.\n\n3. Upon detection of the sequence \"1101\", the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains 1 until a reset occurs.\n\n4. The `reset` signal is synchronous and active-high:\n   - When `reset` is asserted, the FSM returns to its initial state.\n   - The `start_shifting` output is cleared to 0 during reset.\n\n5. Initial Conditions:\n   - All states of the FSM and the `start_shifting` output are initialized to 0 at startup and after reset.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - The FSM must correctly handle overlapping sequences. For example, in the stream \"1101101\", it should detect the sequence twice.\n   - The design must ensure there are no race conditions in sequence detection or output signal generation.\n\n7. Bit Indexing:\n   - `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit if any multi-bit signals are introduced in future enhancements.\n\nThe implementation must adhere strictly to these specifications to ensure correct operation and edge case handling.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
