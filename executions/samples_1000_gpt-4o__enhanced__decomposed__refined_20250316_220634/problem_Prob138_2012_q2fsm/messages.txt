Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Specifications:\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.\n- `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n- `input wire w`: State transition input, 1-bit.\n- `output reg z`: FSM output, 1-bit.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The FSM has six states: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n- States are encoded as follows:\n  - A: 3'b000\n  - B: 3'b001\n  - C: 3'b010\n  - D: 3'b011\n  - E: 3'b100\n  - F: 3'b101\n\nState Transition Table:\n- From State A:\n  - If `w == 1`, transition to State B.\n  - If `w == 0`, remain in State A.\n- From State B:\n  - If `w == 1`, transition to State C.\n  - If `w == 0`, transition to State D.\n- From State C:\n  - If `w == 1`, transition to State E.\n  - If `w == 0`, transition to State D.\n- From State D:\n  - If `w == 1`, transition to State F.\n  - If `w == 0`, transition to State A.\n- From State E:\n  - If `w == 1`, remain in State E.\n  - If `w == 0`, transition to State D.\n- From State F:\n  - If `w == 1`, transition to State C.\n  - If `w == 0`, transition to State D.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- `z = 1` for States E and F.\n- `z = 0` for States A, B, C, D.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On a synchronous active-high reset, the state transitions to State A.\n- Output `z` is determined by the current state and is updated on the positive edge of `clk`.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Use separate `always` blocks for state transition logic and state register updates.\n- State transitions should be evaluated on the positive edge of `clk`.\n- Ensure no race conditions by properly defining state transitions and outputs.\n- Handle all possible state and input combinations.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
