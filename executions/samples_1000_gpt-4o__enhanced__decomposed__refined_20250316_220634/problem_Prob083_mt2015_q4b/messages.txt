Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\n**Port Definitions:**\n- Input: `x` - 1-bit unsigned input\n- Input: `y` - 1-bit unsigned input\n- Output: `z` - 1-bit unsigned output\n\n**Bit Indexing:**\n- All inputs and outputs are single bits, hence no bit indexing is required.\n\n**Combinational Logic Description:**\n- The output `z` is determined by the current values of inputs `x` and `y` without any clock dependencies, indicating purely combinational logic.\n\n**Truth Table Description:**\nThe output `z` is defined by the following truth table, derived from the simulation waveform:\n\n|  x  |  y  |  z  |\n|-----|-----|-----|\n|  0  |  0  |  1  |\n|  0  |  1  |  0  |\n|  1  |  0  |  0  |\n|  1  |  1  |  1  |\n\n**Operation and Precedence:**\n- The output `z` is set to `1` if both inputs `x` and `y` are the same (both `0` or both `1`).\n- Otherwise, `z` is set to `0`.\n\n**Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**\n- Since all inputs are binary (either `0` or `1`), no additional edge cases are anticipated beyond the truth table entries.\n\n**Reset Conditions:**\n- There are no sequential elements in this module; thus, no reset conditions are necessary.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Ensure that the combinational logic for determining `z` adheres strictly to the truth table provided.\n- There are no dependencies on past input values, as the behavior is purely combinational.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
