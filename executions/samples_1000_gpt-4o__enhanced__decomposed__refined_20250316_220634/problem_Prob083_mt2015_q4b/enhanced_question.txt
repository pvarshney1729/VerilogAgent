Module Name: TopModule

**Port Definitions:**
- Input: `x` - 1-bit unsigned input
- Input: `y` - 1-bit unsigned input
- Output: `z` - 1-bit unsigned output

**Bit Indexing:**
- All inputs and outputs are single bits, hence no bit indexing is required.

**Combinational Logic Description:**
- The output `z` is determined by the current values of inputs `x` and `y` without any clock dependencies, indicating purely combinational logic.

**Truth Table Description:**
The output `z` is defined by the following truth table, derived from the simulation waveform:

|  x  |  y  |  z  |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  0  |  0  |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |

**Operation and Precedence:**
- The output `z` is set to `1` if both inputs `x` and `y` are the same (both `0` or both `1`).
- Otherwise, `z` is set to `0`.

**Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**
- Since all inputs are binary (either `0` or `1`), no additional edge cases are anticipated beyond the truth table entries.

**Reset Conditions:**
- There are no sequential elements in this module; thus, no reset conditions are necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that the combinational logic for determining `z` adheres strictly to the truth table provided.
- There are no dependencies on past input values, as the behavior is purely combinational.
