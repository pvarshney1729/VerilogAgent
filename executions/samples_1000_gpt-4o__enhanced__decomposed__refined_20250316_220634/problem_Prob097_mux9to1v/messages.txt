Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `a`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `b`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `c`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `d`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `e`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `f`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `g`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `h`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `i`: 16-bit input vector, unsigned\n  - `sel`: 4-bit input vector, unsigned\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `out`: 16-bit output vector, unsigned\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer.\n- Selection Logic:\n  - `sel = 4'b0000` selects input `a` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b0001` selects input `b` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b0010` selects input `c` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b0011` selects input `d` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b0100` selects input `e` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b0101` selects input `f` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b0110` selects input `g` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b0111` selects input `h` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - `sel = 4'b1000` selects input `i` and assigns it to `out`.\n  - For unused cases where `sel` ranges from `4'b1001` to `4'b1111`, the output `out` should be set to `16'b1111_1111_1111_1111` (all bits set to '1').\n\n- Bit Indexing:\n  - Bit [0] is the least significant bit (LSB), and bit [15] is the most significant bit (MSB) for all 16-bit inputs and the output.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure correct behavior for all possible values of `sel` ranging from 0 to 15.\n- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clock or reset signals.\n\nPrecedence and Dependencies:\n- The output `out` directly depends on the value of the `sel` input, with a clear mapping from `sel` value to input selection or default high state for unused cases.\n                    "
