Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.
  - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset.
  - `input wire x`: Control input signal.
- Outputs:
  - `output reg z`: Output signal.

Signal Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Finite State Machine (FSM):
- State Encoding:
  - Present state `y[2:0]` is a 3-bit register representing the current state of the FSM.
  - Next state `y[2:0]` is determined based on the current state and input `x`.

- State Transition Table:
  - Present State (y[2:0]) | Next State (y[2:0]) when x=0 | Next State (y[2:0]) when x=1 | Output z
  - `000` | `000` | `001` | `0`
  - `001` | `001` | `100` | `0`
  - `010` | `010` | `001` | `0`
  - `011` | `001` | `010` | `1`
  - `100` | `011` | `100` | `1`

Reset Behavior:
- On receiving a synchronous active-high reset, the FSM transitions to state `000`.

Operational Details:
- The FSM transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.
- The output `z` is determined by the current state as defined in the state transition table.
- Ensure all registers, including the state register `y[2:0]`, are initialized to a known state upon reset.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The module behavior is defined for all possible states of `y[2:0]` and input `x`.
- Ensure stable operation under all specified input conditions and transitions.
