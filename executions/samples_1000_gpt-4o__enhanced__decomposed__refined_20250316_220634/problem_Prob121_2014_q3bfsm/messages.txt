Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.\n  - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset.\n  - `input wire x`: Control input signal.\n- Outputs:\n  - `output reg z`: Output signal.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM):\n- State Encoding:\n  - Present state `y[2:0]` is a 3-bit register representing the current state of the FSM.\n  - Next state `y[2:0]` is determined based on the current state and input `x`.\n\n- State Transition Table:\n  - Present State (y[2:0]) | Next State (y[2:0]) when x=0 | Next State (y[2:0]) when x=1 | Output z\n  - `000` | `000` | `001` | `0`\n  - `001` | `001` | `100` | `0`\n  - `010` | `010` | `001` | `0`\n  - `011` | `001` | `010` | `1`\n  - `100` | `011` | `100` | `1`\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On receiving a synchronous active-high reset, the FSM transitions to state `000`.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The FSM transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n- The output `z` is determined by the current state as defined in the state transition table.\n- Ensure all registers, including the state register `y[2:0]`, are initialized to a known state upon reset.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The module behavior is defined for all possible states of `y[2:0]` and input `x`.\n- Ensure stable operation under all specified input conditions and transitions.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
