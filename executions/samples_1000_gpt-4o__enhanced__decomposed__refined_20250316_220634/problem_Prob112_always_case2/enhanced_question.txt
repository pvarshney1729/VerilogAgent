<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module "TopModule" is a combinational logic circuit designed as a priority encoder with the following specifications:

- **Module Name**: TopModule
- **Inputs**:
  - `in`: A 4-bit vector input, denoted as `in[3:0]`. Here, `in[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
  
- **Outputs**:
  - `pos`: A 2-bit vector output, denoted as `pos[1:0]`, representing the binary position of the first high ('1') bit found in the input vector `in`.

**Functionality**:
- The priority encoder scans the input `in` from the MSB (`in[3]`) to the LSB (`in[0]`).
- The output `pos` provides the binary index of the first high ('1') bit encountered during this scan. The index is based on a 0-based counting system (`in[0]` corresponds to position 0).
- If the input `in` is `4'b0000` (i.e., all bits are low), the output `pos` should be `2'b00`.

**Behavioral Examples**:
- Example 1: If `in` is `4'b1000`, then `pos` should be `2'b11` since the first high bit is at position 3.
- Example 2: If `in` is `4'b0100`, then `pos` should be `2'b10` since the first high bit is at position 2.
- Example 3: If `in` is `4'b0010`, then `pos` should be `2'b01` since the first high bit is at position 1.
- Example 4: If `in` is `4'b0001`, then `pos` should be `2'b00` since the first high bit is at position 0.
- Example 5: If `in` is `4'b0000`, then `pos` should be `2'b00` as no high bit is present.

**Notes**:
- This module should be implemented as a purely combinational circuit, meaning there are no clock inputs or sequential elements involved.
- The operation of the module should be completed in a single evaluation cycle of the simulation or synthesis tool.
- No reset signal is necessary as there are no state-holding elements in this design.
