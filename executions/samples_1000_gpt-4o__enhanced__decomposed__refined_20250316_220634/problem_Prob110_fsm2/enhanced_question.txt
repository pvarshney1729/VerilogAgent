Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input clk: A clock signal, positive edge-triggered, width = 1 bit.
- input areset: An asynchronous active-high reset signal, width = 1 bit.
- input j: Input signal used to control state transitions, width = 1 bit.
- input k: Input signal used to control state transitions, width = 1 bit.
- output out: Output signal representing the state output, width = 1 bit.

State Machine Description:
- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- The machine transitions between states based on the values of inputs j and k.
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal.
- The initial state after reset is OFF.

State Definitions:
1. State OFF:
   - Output: out = 0
   - Transitions:
     - If j = 0, remain in OFF.
     - If j = 1, transition to ON.

2. State ON:
   - Output: out = 1
   - Transitions:
     - If k = 0, remain in ON.
     - If k = 1, transition to OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal (areset) is active-high and asynchronous.
- When areset is asserted (high), the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state, regardless of the clock.
- Upon release of areset (returning low), normal state transitions based on inputs j and k resume on the next rising edge of clk.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are treated as single-bit signals.
- Bit indexing is not applicable due to single-bit nature of the ports.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The behavior is fully defined for all possible combinations of inputs j and k in both states.
- The transition logic ensures no race conditions, as changes occur synchronously with the clock except during asynchronous reset.
