Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Specification for the Verilog module `TopModule` is defined as follows:\n\n**Module Interface:**\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal, used for synchronizing sequential logic.\n- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal, initializes the state machine to the reset state.\n- `input wire in`: Input signal, used to determine state transitions.\n- `output reg out`: Output signal, driven by the current state of the state machine.\n\n**State Machine Description:**\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with two states: `State_B` and `State_A`.\n\n**State Definitions:**\n- `State_B`: `out = 1`\n- `State_A`: `out = 0`\n\n**Reset Behavior:**\n- The state machine begins in `State_B` upon reset. The reset is active-high and synchronous, meaning the state transitions to `State_B` on the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.\n\n**State Transition Conditions:**\n- From `State_B`:\n  - Transition to `State_A` if `in = 0`\n  - Remain in `State_B` if `in = 1`\n- From `State_A`:\n  - Transition to `State_B` if `in = 0`\n  - Remain in `State_A` if `in = 1`\n\n**Bit and Indexing Conventions:**\n- All ports are single-bit signals, and indexing is not required.\n\n**Clock Cycle Relationships:**\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n**Initial Conditions and Assumptions:**\n- On reset (with `reset` high during a clock edge), the state is initialized to `State_B` with `out` set to `1`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Behavior is fully defined for all input combinations since there are only two states and one binary input.\n\nEnsure the state machine logic is implemented using appropriate `always` blocks for synchronous operations, and prioritize the synchronous reset logic within the state transition logic.\n                    "

Use reg [1:0] for state and next_state. Define localparam A = 2'b00 and B = 2'b01 for state encoding.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding using localparam\n  localparam A = 2'b00;\n  localparam B = 2'b01;\n\n  // State registers\n  reg [1:0] state, next_state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with synchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk) and include reset logic to set the state to B when reset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  parameter A = 1'b0, B = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      state <= B;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on the current state and input 'in'.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [0:0] {\n    STATE_A = 1'b0,\n    STATE_B = 1'b1\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_B: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n      end\n      STATE_A: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n      end\n      default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to reset state\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statement. Set output 'out' based on the current state: out = 1 for state B, out = 0 for state A.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n```verilog\n[BEGIN]\n  // State encoding\n  localparam STATE_A = 1'b0;\n  localparam STATE_B = 1'b1;\n\n  // State register\n  reg current_state;\n\n  // Output logic based on current state\n  assign out = (current_state == STATE_B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n[END]\n```\n                    "
