<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Specification for the Verilog module `TopModule` is defined as follows:

**Module Interface:**
- `input wire clk`: Clock signal, used for synchronizing sequential logic.
- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal, initializes the state machine to the reset state.
- `input wire in`: Input signal, used to determine state transitions.
- `output reg out`: Output signal, driven by the current state of the state machine.

**State Machine Description:**
The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: `State_B` and `State_A`.

**State Definitions:**
- `State_B`: `out = 1`
- `State_A`: `out = 0`

**Reset Behavior:**
- The state machine begins in `State_B` upon reset. The reset is active-high and synchronous, meaning the state transitions to `State_B` on the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.

**State Transition Conditions:**
- From `State_B`:
  - Transition to `State_A` if `in = 0`
  - Remain in `State_B` if `in = 1`
- From `State_A`:
  - Transition to `State_B` if `in = 0`
  - Remain in `State_A` if `in = 1`

**Bit and Indexing Conventions:**
- All ports are single-bit signals, and indexing is not required.

**Clock Cycle Relationships:**
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.

**Initial Conditions and Assumptions:**
- On reset (with `reset` high during a clock edge), the state is initialized to `State_B` with `out` set to `1`.

**Edge Cases:**
- Behavior is fully defined for all input combinations since there are only two states and one binary input.

Ensure the state machine logic is implemented using appropriate `always` blocks for synchronous operations, and prioritize the synchronous reset logic within the state transition logic.
