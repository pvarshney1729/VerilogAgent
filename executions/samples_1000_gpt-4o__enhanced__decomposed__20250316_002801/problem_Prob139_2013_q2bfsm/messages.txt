        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input clk: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.\n- input resetn: 1-bit synchronous, active-low reset input.\n- input x: 1-bit input from the motor.\n- input y: 1-bit input from the motor.\n- output reg f: 1-bit output to control the motor.\n- output reg g: 1-bit output to control the motor.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- Initial State: State A is the reset state.\n- Reset Behavior: \n  * When resetn is low (asserted), the FSM remains in State A, and outputs f and g should be reset to 0.\n  * When resetn is deasserted (high), the FSM transitions from State A on the next positive clock edge.\n  \nFSM Operation:\n1. Upon reset deassertion, the FSM transitions from State A and sets f = 1 for exactly one clock cycle.\n2. The FSM then enters a monitoring phase for input x:\n   - It waits for the pattern 1, 0, 1 from input x across three successive positive clock edges.\n   - Once the pattern is detected, g is set to 1 on the next clock cycle.\n3. After setting g = 1, the FSM enters a monitoring phase for input y:\n   - If y becomes 1 within the next two positive clock edges, g remains 1 permanently (until reset).\n   - If y does not become 1 within these two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nOperational Details:\n- All state transitions and output updates occur on the rising edge of clk.\n- Assume bit[0] is the least significant bit when referring to bit positions, if applicable.\n- All outputs, including f and g, must be initialized to 0 during reset.\n- Ensure no race conditions exist by properly capturing inputs on clock edges.\n- Edge cases, such as transitions during reset deassertion, must follow the defined FSM state transitions and output assignments as specified above.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
