Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input clk: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.
- input resetn: 1-bit synchronous, active-low reset input.
- input x: 1-bit input from the motor.
- input y: 1-bit input from the motor.
- output reg f: 1-bit output to control the motor.
- output reg g: 1-bit output to control the motor.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- Initial State: State A is the reset state.
- Reset Behavior: 
  * When resetn is low (asserted), the FSM remains in State A, and outputs f and g should be reset to 0.
  * When resetn is deasserted (high), the FSM transitions from State A on the next positive clock edge.
  
FSM Operation:
1. Upon reset deassertion, the FSM transitions from State A and sets f = 1 for exactly one clock cycle.
2. The FSM then enters a monitoring phase for input x:
   - It waits for the pattern 1, 0, 1 from input x across three successive positive clock edges.
   - Once the pattern is detected, g is set to 1 on the next clock cycle.
3. After setting g = 1, the FSM enters a monitoring phase for input y:
   - If y becomes 1 within the next two positive clock edges, g remains 1 permanently (until reset).
   - If y does not become 1 within these two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently (until reset).

Operational Details:
- All state transitions and output updates occur on the rising edge of clk.
- Assume bit[0] is the least significant bit when referring to bit positions, if applicable.
- All outputs, including f and g, must be initialized to 0 during reset.
- Ensure no race conditions exist by properly capturing inputs on clock edges.
- Edge cases, such as transitions during reset deassertion, must follow the defined FSM state transitions and output assignments as specified above.
