<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input wire clk`: Clock input for synchronizing the state transitions. Transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock.
- `input wire reset`: Active-high, synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the state machine resets to its initial state.
- `input wire w`: Input signal to determine state transitions.
- `output reg z`: Output signal representing the current state's output value.

### State Machine Description

The state machine has six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each state is encoded uniquely using a minimum number of bits (3 bits recommended for encoding).

#### State Encodings (suggested):

- A: `3'b000`
- B: `3'b001`
- C: `3'b010`
- D: `3'b011`
- E: `3'b100`
- F: `3'b101`

#### State Transition Table:

- From State A:
  - On `w = 1`: Transition to State B
  - On `w = 0`: Remain in State A

- From State B:
  - On `w = 1`: Transition to State C
  - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D

- From State C:
  - On `w = 1`: Transition to State E
  - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D

- From State D:
  - On `w = 1`: Transition to State F
  - On `w = 0`: Transition to State A

- From State E:
  - On `w = 1`: Remain in State E
  - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D

- From State F:
  - On `w = 1`: Transition to State C
  - On `w = 0`: Transition to State D

#### Output Logic:

- In State A, B, C, or D: `z = 0`
- In State E or F: `z = 1`

### Reset Behavior:

- The `reset` signal, when asserted, resets the state machine to State A. This occurs synchronously with the clock.

### Implementation Guidelines:

- Use separate `always` blocks for the state transition logic (state table) and the state register update (state flip-flops).
- The state register should be updated on the positive edge of the clock or when the reset is asserted.
- The output logic can be implemented using a continuous assignment statement or within an `always` block sensitive to the state register.

### Edge Cases:

- Ensure that all possible state encodings are accounted for, including any unused state encodings, which should safely transition to State A or a known state.
- Handle input boundaries by making sure `w` is strictly treated as a single-bit input.

### Bit Indexing:

- Bit indexing follows the MSB-LSB convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

This specification ensures clarity and correctness, facilitating precise Verilog implementation of the state machine described.
