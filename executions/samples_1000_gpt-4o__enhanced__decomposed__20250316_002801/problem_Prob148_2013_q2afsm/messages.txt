Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: `TopModule`\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronization, positive edge-triggered.\n- `input resetn`: Active-low synchronous reset signal. When asserted (resetn = 0), the FSM transitions to the initial state, A.\n- `input [2:0] r`: Request signals from three devices, where `r[0]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `r[2]` is the least significant bit (LSB). Each bit represents a request from a device.\n- `output [2:0] g`: Grant signals corresponding to the three devices, with `g[0]` as the MSB and `g[2]` as the LSB. Each bit represents a grant to a device.\n\nState Definitions:\n- State A: Initial and default state where no grants are given.\n- State B: Grants to device 0 (`g[0] = 1`).\n- State C: Grants to device 1 (`g[1] = 1`).\n- State D: Grants to device 2 (`g[2] = 1`).\n\nState Encodings (Binary representation, assign as needed):\n- State A: 2'b00\n- State B: 2'b01\n- State C: 2'b10\n- State D: 2'b11\n\nFSM Description:\n- The FSM remains in State A if no requests are detected (`r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, `r[2] = 0`).\n- Transition from State A to State B if `r[0] = 1`, indicating device 0 requests access.\n- Transition from State A to State C if `r[0] = 0` and `r[1] = 1`, indicating device 1 requests access, given no higher priority request.\n- Transition from State A to State D if `r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, and `r[2] = 1`, indicating device 2 requests access, given no higher priority requests.\n- In State B, remain in B if `r[0] = 1`; otherwise, transition back to State A.\n- In State C, remain in C if `r[1] = 1`; otherwise, transition back to State A.\n- In State D, remain in D if `r[2] = 1`; otherwise, transition back to State A.\n\nPriority System:\n- Device 0 has the highest priority, followed by device 1, and device 2 has the lowest priority. This priority dictates state transitions from State A.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On reset (resetn = 0), transition to State A, and all grant signals `g[0]`, `g[1]`, and `g[2]` are deasserted (set to 0).\n\nImplementation Guidelines:\n- Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and state register updates.\n- State transitions should occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Outputs `g[i]` can be defined using continuous assignment or within an always block, ensuring they reflect the current state.\n- Ensure that all state registers have explicitly defined initial values for simulation accuracy.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If multiple requests are made simultaneously, the FSM grants priority based on the order: device 0 > device 1 > device 2.\n                    "
