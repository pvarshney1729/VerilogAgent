<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to follow the specification of a Moore state machine with one-hot encoding. The state machine transitions between states based on the inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack`. The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are determined by the current state. We will use combinational logic to determine the next state and the outputs based on the current state and inputs.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use one-hot encoding for the states, where each state is represented by a unique bit in a 10-bit vector. This allows us to easily determine the current state and transition to the next state.

2. **Next State Logic**: We will implement combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs. This logic will be implemented using `assign` statements.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are determined by the current state. We will implement this logic using `assign` statements.

4. **Port Declarations**: We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

5. **Combinational Logic**: We will use `always @(*)` blocks for combinational logic, ensuring that all inputs are considered in the sensitivity list.

6. **Synchronous Reset**: Although the specification does not explicitly mention a reset signal, we will assume that the state machine starts in the `S` state, which is the default state after reset.

By following these steps, we can implement the `TopModule` according to the given specification and guidelines.
