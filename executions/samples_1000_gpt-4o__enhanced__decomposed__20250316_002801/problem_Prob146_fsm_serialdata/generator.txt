To implement the `TopModule`, we will create a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a serial data stream according to the specified protocol. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The initial state where the FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0).
2. **START**: Confirms the start bit and prepares to receive data bits.
3. **DATA**: Receives the 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit.
4. **STOP**: Verifies the stop bit (logic 1) and asserts the `done` signal if correct.
5. **ERROR**: Handles cases where the stop bit is incorrect, waiting for a new start bit.

The FSM will transition between these states based on the input signal `in` and the current state. The `out_byte` will be updated with the received data when the FSM reaches the STOP state with a valid stop bit. The `done` signal will be asserted in the STOP state when the byte is correctly received.

The synchronous reset will initialize the FSM to the IDLE state and clear all registers. The FSM will operate on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring that all state transitions and data captures are synchronized.

The implementation will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all ports and signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.
