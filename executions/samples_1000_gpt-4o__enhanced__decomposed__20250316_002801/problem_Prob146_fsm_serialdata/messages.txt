        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and must adhere to the following interface specifications. All input and output ports are single bit signals unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n- `input clk`: The clock signal for sequential logic, operating on the positive edge.\n- `input in`: The serial data input, receiving a stream of bits.\n- `input reset`: An active-high, synchronous reset signal.\n- `output [7:0] out_byte`: An 8-bit output representing the received data byte.\n- `output done`: A signal indicating the completion and validity of `out_byte`.\n\nThe module should implement a finite state machine (FSM) to process a serial communication protocol with the following characteristics:\n\n1. **Protocol Overview**: \n   - Each data transmission consists of one start bit (logic 0), followed by 8 data bits, ending with one stop bit (logic 1).\n   - The idle state of the line is logic 1 when no data is being transmitted.\n\n2. **Data Reception**:\n   - The FSM must detect the start bit (logic 0) to begin receiving a byte.\n   - Following the start bit, it will sequentially capture the 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit (bit[0]) and ending with the most significant bit (bit[7]).\n   - After capturing the data bits, the FSM must verify the presence of a stop bit (logic 1).\n\n3. **Output Behavior**:\n   - The `out_byte` output is valid only when `done` is asserted (logic 1); otherwise, its value is considered a don't-care.\n   - The `done` signal is asserted each time a complete and correctly received byte, including a valid stop bit, is detected.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - If the stop bit is incorrect (not logic 1), the FSM will enter a state that waits for the next occurrence of a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.\n\n5. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - The synchronous reset initializes all internal state registers and outputs. The FSM returns to its initial state upon reset activation.\n\nThe design must ensure clear bit indexing with bit[0] as the least significant bit, handle all edge cases, and avoid race conditions, maintaining operation integrity across clock cycles.\n                    "
