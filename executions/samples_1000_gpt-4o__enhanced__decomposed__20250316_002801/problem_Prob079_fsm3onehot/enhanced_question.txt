Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal for state transition control.
  - `input wire [3:0] state`: Four-bit input representing current state using one-hot encoding.

- Outputs:
  - `output reg [3:0] next_state`: Four-bit output representing the next state using one-hot encoding.
  - `output reg out`: Single-bit output signal derived from the current state.

State Encoding:
- Use the following one-hot encoding for the state representation:
  - State A: 4'b0001
  - State B: 4'b0010
  - State C: 4'b0100
  - State D: 4'b1000

State Transition Table:
- The state transitions are defined as follows based on the input `in`:
  - From State A:
    - If `in` = 0: Transition to State A
    - If `in` = 1: Transition to State B
  - From State B:
    - If `in` = 0: Transition to State C
    - If `in` = 1: Transition to State B
  - From State C:
    - If `in` = 0: Transition to State A
    - If `in` = 1: Transition to State D
  - From State D:
    - If `in` = 0: Transition to State C
    - If `in` = 1: Transition to State B

Output Logic:
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state:
  - State A: `out` = 0
  - State B: `out` = 0
  - State C: `out` = 0
  - State D: `out` = 1

Design Requirements:
- This module implements a combinational logic section of a Moore state machine. The transitions and outputs depend only on the current state and input.
- Assume that all inputs and the current state are stable during the evaluation of the combinational logic.
- There are no sequential elements (flip-flops or registers) to implement in this module, and no clock or reset signals are defined, as the specification only covers combinational logic.

Note: Ensure correct synthesis of one-hot encoded states for optimal performance and resource usage.
