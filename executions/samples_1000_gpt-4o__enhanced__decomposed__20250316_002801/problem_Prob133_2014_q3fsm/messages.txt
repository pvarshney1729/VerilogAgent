Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: Clock signal, 1-bit, positive edge-triggered.\n  - reset: Synchronous reset signal, active high, 1-bit.\n  - s: Control input for state transition, 1-bit.\n  - w: Data input for FSM evaluation, 1-bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - z: Output signal indicating FSM condition met, 1-bit.\n\nFSM Description:\n- The FSM initially resides in State A upon reset. Reset initializes all states and registers to their default values, specifically State A and any counters to zero.\n\n- State Transitions:\n  - State A: The FSM remains in State A as long as input 's' is 0. Transition to State B occurs when 's' becomes 1.\n  - State B: Upon entering State B, the FSM begins to evaluate the input 'w' over the next three consecutive clock cycles.\n\n- Operation in State B:\n  - A counter (initialized to zero) tracks the number of cycles where 'w' equals 1 during these three clock cycles.\n  - If 'w' is equal to 1 in exactly two of these three cycles, set output 'z' to 1 in the immediate subsequent clock cycle.\n  - If the condition is not met, set 'z' to 0 in the immediate subsequent clock cycle.\n  - The FSM continues to evaluate 'w' in three-cycle intervals while remaining in State B.\n\n- Input and Output Conditions:\n  - The input 's' is only relevant for transitions from State A to State B.\n  - The evaluation of 'w' is only relevant in State B.\n  - The 'z' output is updated based on the count of 'w' after every three cycles within State B.\n\n- Bit Indexing:\n  - All signals are treated as single-bit signals. There is no multi-bit indexing involved.\n\n- Initial Conditions:\n  - On reset, the FSM is placed in State A. All internal counters and state indicators are reset to zero.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the FSM correctly evaluates 'w' precisely during the three specified clock cycles and that 'z' is updated immediately after these evaluations.\n- The FSM must handle unexpected transitions caused by glitches on the 's' or 'w' inputs by ensuring robust state management and transition logic.\n\nThe FSM must utilize minimal states to achieve the described functionality effectively and efficiently.\n                    "
