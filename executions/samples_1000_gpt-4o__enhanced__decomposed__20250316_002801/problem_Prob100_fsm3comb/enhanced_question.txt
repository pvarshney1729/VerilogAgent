Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire in` : Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [1:0] state` : 2-bit input signal representing the current state.
  
- Outputs:
  - `output reg [1:0] next_state` : 2-bit output signal representing the next state.
  - `output reg out` : Single-bit output signal.

State Encoding:
- State A: 2'b00
- State B: 2'b01
- State C: 2'b10
- State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table:
- From State A:
  - If `in = 0`, Next State: A
  - If `in = 1`, Next State: B
  - Output: 0

- From State B:
  - If `in = 0`, Next State: C
  - If `in = 1`, Next State: B
  - Output: 0

- From State C:
  - If `in = 0`, Next State: A
  - If `in = 1`, Next State: D
  - Output: 0

- From State D:
  - If `in = 0`, Next State: C
  - If `in = 1`, Next State: B
  - Output: 1

Design Requirements:
- The module implements the combinational logic portion of a Moore state machine.
- Ensure that inputs and outputs are correctly interpreted according to the state transition table.
- The output `out` is driven solely by the current state and not by the input `in`.
- The state transitions are based on the current state and input `in`.
- This specification deals exclusively with the combinational logic for state transitions and output generation; no sequential elements like flip-flops or registers are described, as the focus is on combinational logic.
