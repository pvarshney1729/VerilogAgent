        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing the sequential logic. Trigger on the positive edge.\n- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the FSM resets to the initial state.\n- `input wire in`: One-bit data input stream to be processed by the FSM.\n- `output reg disc`: One-bit output signal to indicate a bit should be discarded. Asserted for one clock cycle immediately after detecting the pattern 0111110.\n- `output reg flag`: One-bit output signal to indicate the detection of a frame boundary. Asserted for one clock cycle immediately after detecting the pattern 01111110.\n- `output reg err`: One-bit output signal to indicate an error condition when 7 or more consecutive 1s are detected. Asserted for one clock cycle immediately after the condition is detected.\n\nFSM Description:\n- The FSM is a Moore machine designed to process a continuous bit stream and identify specific patterns.\n- The FSM should be designed to recognize and respond to the following sequences:\n  1. Sequence `0111110`: Trigger the `disc` output signal.\n  2. Sequence `01111110`: Trigger the `flag` output signal.\n  3. Sequence `01111111...`: Trigger the `err` output signal, indicating 7 or more consecutive 1s.\n\nInitial State:\n- Upon reset (active-high), the FSM transitions to an initial state that mimics the condition as if the previous input was 0. This ensures that no false recognitions occur immediately after a reset.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The reset is synchronous and considered on the positive edge of `clk`.\n- Output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are registered and will be asserted for exactly one clock cycle starting in the cycle immediately following the detection of their respective conditions.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` corresponds to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The FSM should correctly handle transitions and outputs for continuous streams without introducing delays or errors at sequence boundaries.\n- Ensure there are no race conditions by clearly defining state transitions and signal assertions only on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\nOutput Signal Initialization:\n- All output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be initialized to logic low (0) at startup and upon reset to ensure predictable behavior.\n\nClock Cycle Relationship:\n- All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, ensuring consistent timing and preventing race conditions in the FSM logic.\n                    "
