<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes specific bit patterns in a continuous bit stream. The FSM should detect the following sequences:
1. `0111110`: This pattern indicates that a bit needs to be discarded (`disc`).
2. `01111110`: This pattern indicates a frame boundary (`flag`).
3. `01111111...`: This pattern indicates an error condition (`err`).

The FSM will have states representing the number of consecutive '1's seen. The state transitions will be based on the input bit `in`. The outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) will be asserted based on the current state and the input bit.

The FSM will start in an initial state that behaves as if the previous input was '0'. The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the positive edge of the clock. The outputs are registered and will be asserted for one clock cycle immediately after the condition is detected.

The FSM will be implemented using a `typedef` for state encoding, and the state transitions and output logic will be handled in separate always blocks. The outputs will be registered to ensure they are asserted for a complete cycle after the condition occurs.

The implementation will adhere to the provided coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.
