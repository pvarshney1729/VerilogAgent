Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing the sequential logic. Trigger on the positive edge.
- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the FSM resets to the initial state.
- `input wire in`: One-bit data input stream to be processed by the FSM.
- `output reg disc`: One-bit output signal to indicate a bit should be discarded. Asserted for one clock cycle immediately after detecting the pattern 0111110.
- `output reg flag`: One-bit output signal to indicate the detection of a frame boundary. Asserted for one clock cycle immediately after detecting the pattern 01111110.
- `output reg err`: One-bit output signal to indicate an error condition when 7 or more consecutive 1s are detected. Asserted for one clock cycle immediately after the condition is detected.

FSM Description:
- The FSM is a Moore machine designed to process a continuous bit stream and identify specific patterns.
- The FSM should be designed to recognize and respond to the following sequences:
  1. Sequence `0111110`: Trigger the `disc` output signal.
  2. Sequence `01111110`: Trigger the `flag` output signal.
  3. Sequence `01111111...`: Trigger the `err` output signal, indicating 7 or more consecutive 1s.

Initial State:
- Upon reset (active-high), the FSM transitions to an initial state that mimics the condition as if the previous input was 0. This ensures that no false recognitions occur immediately after a reset.

Operational Details:
- The reset is synchronous and considered on the positive edge of `clk`.
- Output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are registered and will be asserted for exactly one clock cycle starting in the cycle immediately following the detection of their respective conditions.
- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` corresponds to the least significant bit (LSB).

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The FSM should correctly handle transitions and outputs for continuous streams without introducing delays or errors at sequence boundaries.
- Ensure there are no race conditions by clearly defining state transitions and signal assertions only on the rising edge of `clk`.

Output Signal Initialization:
- All output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be initialized to logic low (0) at startup and upon reset to ensure predictable behavior.

Clock Cycle Relationship:
- All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, ensuring consistent timing and preventing race conditions in the FSM logic.
