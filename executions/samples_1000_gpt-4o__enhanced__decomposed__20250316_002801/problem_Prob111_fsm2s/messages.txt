Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module `TopModule` implements a Moore state machine with a synchronous reset. The specifications are as follows:\n\n- **Input Ports:**\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, used for synchronizing the state transitions.\n  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal that initializes the state machine to the `OFF` state.\n  - `input j`: Input signal to influence state transitions when in the `OFF` state.\n  - `input k`: Input signal to influence state transitions when in the `ON` state.\n\n- **Output Ports:**\n  - `output out`: Represents the current output of the state machine. It is `0` when in the `OFF` state and `1` when in the `ON` state.\n\n- **State Machine Description:**\n  - The state machine consists of two states: `OFF` and `ON`.\n  - State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n  - Resetting the state machine with an active-high `reset` signal will synchronously set the state to `OFF` with `out = 0`.\n\n- **State Transition Table:**\n  - `OFF` (out = 0):\n    - If `j = 0`: Remain in `OFF`\n    - If `j = 1`: Transition to `ON`\n  - `ON` (out = 1):\n    - If `k = 0`: Remain in `ON`\n    - If `k = 1`: Transition to `OFF`\n\n- **Additional Notes:**\n  - The reset is synchronous and will take effect on the next rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.\n  - Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single bit.\n  - Ensure all flip-flops or registers used for holding the state are initialized to the `OFF` state on reset.\n                    "

Use binary encoding for states OFF (2'b00) and ON (2'b01).\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  parameter OFF = 2'b00;\n  parameter ON  = 2'b01;\n\n  // State register\n  reg [1:0] state, next_state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with synchronous reset logic to state OFF. Use always @(posedge clk) for synchronous reset.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      state <= OFF;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic would be here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic based on current state and inputs j and k. Use a case statement to handle state transitions.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // State transition logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      OFF: begin\n        if (j)\n          next_state = ON;\n        else\n          next_state = OFF;\n      end\n      ON: begin\n        if (k)\n          next_state = OFF;\n        else\n          next_state = ON;\n      end\n      default: next_state = OFF; // Default state\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic for the Moore machine. Output depends only on the current state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // State register\n  reg state;\n\n  // Output logic based on current state\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (state)\n      OFF: out = 1'b0;\n      ON:  out = 1'b1;\n      default: out = 1'b0; // Default case to handle unexpected states\n    endcase\n  end\n                    "
