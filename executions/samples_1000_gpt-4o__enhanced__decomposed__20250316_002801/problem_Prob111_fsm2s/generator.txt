To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine with the specified behavior, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the States**: We have two states, `OFF` and `ON`. We'll use binary encoding for these states, with `OFF` as `1'b0` and `ON` as `1'b1`.

2. **State Register**: We'll use a register to hold the current state. This register will be updated on the rising edge of the clock.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is active-high and synchronous, meaning it will set the state to `OFF` on the next rising edge of the clock when `reset` is high.

4. **Next State Logic**: We'll implement combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

5. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. We'll use combinational logic to set the output based on the current state.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We'll declare all ports and signals as `logic`, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensure the synchronous reset is implemented correctly without including `reset` in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.

By following these steps, we can ensure the module behaves as specified.
