Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active high reset.\n  - `input wire in`: Input signal for state transition.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg out`: Output signal, updated according to the state.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Type: Moore state machine.\n- States: Four states denoted as State A, State B, State C, and State D.\n- Initialization: On reset, the FSM initializes to State A.\n- State Encoding: Use binary encoding for states, where:\n  - State A = 2'b00\n  - State B = 2'b01\n  - State C = 2'b10\n  - State D = 2'b11\n\nState Transition Table:\n- Current State: State A\n  - Next State if `in`=0: State A\n  - Next State if `in`=1: State B\n  - Output: 0\n\n- Current State: State B\n  - Next State if `in`=0: State C\n  - Next State if `in`=1: State B\n  - Output: 0\n\n- Current State: State C\n  - Next State if `in`=0: State A\n  - Next State if `in`=1: State D\n  - Output: 0\n\n- Current State: State D\n  - Next State if `in`=0: State C\n  - Next State if `in`=1: State B\n  - Output: 1\n\nOperational Details:\n- The FSM transitions between states based on the input `in`, at the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The `reset` signal, when high, synchronously resets the FSM to State A at the next positive edge of `clk`.\n- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and does not depend on the input `in`.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Ensure that all state transitions and output updates occur on the positive edge of `clk`.\n- The FSM should handle all possible input conditions and transitions without undefined behavior.\n- The output and state transitions should be clearly defined for all input combinations, ensuring no race conditions exist.\n                    "
