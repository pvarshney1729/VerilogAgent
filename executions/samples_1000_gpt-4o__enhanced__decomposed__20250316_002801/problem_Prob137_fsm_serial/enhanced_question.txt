Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic clk` (Clock signal for triggering sequential logic on the positive edge)
  - `input logic reset` (Active-high synchronous reset)
  - `input logic in` (Serial input stream containing bits for processing)

- Output Ports:
  - `output logic done` (Indicates when a byte has been correctly received)

Functional Description:
This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to interpret a serial bit stream according to an older communication protocol that uses 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. The protocol transmits the least significant bit (LSB) first.

Behavior and Processing:
- Start Bit Detection: The FSM begins by detecting a start bit, which is a '0'.
- Data Bit Reception: Following the start bit, the FSM captures 8 data bits, one per clock cycle.
- Stop Bit Verification: The FSM expects a stop bit ('1') immediately after the 8th data bit.
- Error Handling: If the stop bit is not '1' when expected, the FSM halts further processing until it detects a '1' to signify the end of a potential erroneous byte sequence.
- Completion Signal: The `done` output is asserted high when a complete byte (start bit, 8 data bits, and stop bit) is correctly received.

Clock and Reset:
- The FSM transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The `reset` input is synchronous and active-high, initializing the FSM to its idle state. All registers and flip-flops return to their default states upon reset.

Signal Behavior:
- All sequential elements are initialized to zero or their respective idle states at reset.
- The FSM ensures no race conditions by strictly adhering to clock edge transitions for state updates.

Edge Cases:
- If continuous logic '1' is received representing idle states, the FSM will remain in the idle state waiting for a start bit.
- If a start bit is followed by fewer than 8 data bits before receiving a stop bit, the FSM resets to idle and waits for a new start bit sequence.

Indexing and Conventions:
- Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Note: Ensure the logic is optimized to handle noise or spurious signals that may mimic the protocol frames to prevent false positive byte detections.
