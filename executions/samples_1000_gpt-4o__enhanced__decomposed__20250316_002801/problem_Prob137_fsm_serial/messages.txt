        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input logic clk` (Clock signal for triggering sequential logic on the positive edge)\n  - `input logic reset` (Active-high synchronous reset)\n  - `input logic in` (Serial input stream containing bits for processing)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output logic done` (Indicates when a byte has been correctly received)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to interpret a serial bit stream according to an older communication protocol that uses 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. The protocol transmits the least significant bit (LSB) first.\n\nBehavior and Processing:\n- Start Bit Detection: The FSM begins by detecting a start bit, which is a '0'.\n- Data Bit Reception: Following the start bit, the FSM captures 8 data bits, one per clock cycle.\n- Stop Bit Verification: The FSM expects a stop bit ('1') immediately after the 8th data bit.\n- Error Handling: If the stop bit is not '1' when expected, the FSM halts further processing until it detects a '1' to signify the end of a potential erroneous byte sequence.\n- Completion Signal: The `done` output is asserted high when a complete byte (start bit, 8 data bits, and stop bit) is correctly received.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- The FSM transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The `reset` input is synchronous and active-high, initializing the FSM to its idle state. All registers and flip-flops return to their default states upon reset.\n\nSignal Behavior:\n- All sequential elements are initialized to zero or their respective idle states at reset.\n- The FSM ensures no race conditions by strictly adhering to clock edge transitions for state updates.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If continuous logic '1' is received representing idle states, the FSM will remain in the idle state waiting for a start bit.\n- If a start bit is followed by fewer than 8 data bits before receiving a stop bit, the FSM resets to idle and waits for a new start bit sequence.\n\nIndexing and Conventions:\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nNote: Ensure the logic is optimized to handle noise or spurious signals that may mimic the protocol frames to prevent false positive byte detections.\n                    "
