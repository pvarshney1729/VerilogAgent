<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to design a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the pattern "1101" on the `data` input, shifts in 4 additional bits to determine the delay duration, waits for a counting operation to complete, and then notifies the user. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The initial state where the FSM waits for the pattern "1101".
2. **DETECT_1, DETECT_11, DETECT_110, DETECT_1101**: Intermediate states to detect the pattern "1101".
3. **SHIFT**: State where `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles to shift in additional bits.
4. **COUNT**: State where `counting` is asserted, waiting for `done_counting`.
5. **DONE**: State where `done` is asserted, waiting for `ack` to return to IDLE.

The FSM transitions are controlled by the `clk` and `reset` signals. The `reset` is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with respect to the clock. We will use a shift counter to ensure `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 cycles. The FSM will transition between states based on the input signals and the current state.

The implementation will follow the provided coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring the reset is synchronous. The FSM will be implemented using an `always_ff` block for state transitions and an `always_comb` block for next state and output logic.
