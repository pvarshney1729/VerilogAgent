        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: Clock input, 1 bit. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset input, 1 bit. Resets the state machine to its initial state, searching for the \"1101\" pattern.\n  - `data`: Serial data input, 1 bit. Used to detect the \"1101\" pattern and determine the delay duration.\n  - `done_counting`: Signal input, 1 bit. Indicates the completion of the counting operation.\n  - `ack`: Acknowledgment input, 1 bit. Used by the user to acknowledge the timer notification.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `shift_ena`: Enable signal output, 1 bit. Asserted high for exactly four clock cycles after detecting the \"1101\" pattern to shift in the delay duration.\n  - `counting`: Signal output, 1 bit. Asserted high when waiting for the counters to finish counting.\n  - `done`: Notification signal output, 1 bit. Asserted high to notify the user that the timer has completed its operation.\n\nFunctionality:\n1. The finite-state machine (FSM) is responsible for controlling the timer based on the following sequence:\n   - Begin in a state where it searches for the serial input pattern \"1101\".\n   - Upon detecting the pattern \"1101\", assert `shift_ena` for exactly four clock cycles. This enables the shifting in of additional 4 bits from the `data` input to determine the delay duration.\n   - After the four cycles, enter a state where the `counting` output is asserted, indicating that the module is waiting for the counters to complete their operation.\n   - Remain in the counting state until the `done_counting` input is asserted high, indicating that the counting operation is finished.\n   - Once `done_counting` is high, assert the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out.\n   - Wait for the `ack` input to be asserted high by the user, acknowledging the timer notification.\n   - Upon acknowledgment, reset the FSM to the initial state to search for the next occurrence of the \"1101\" pattern.\n\nSequential Logic and Reset:\n- The FSM transitions are synchronized to the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The state machine has an active-high synchronous reset (`reset`), which initializes the FSM to the state where it begins searching for the \"1101\" sequence.\n\nBit Indexing and MSB/LSB Conventions:\n- All inputs and outputs are single bits, with `bit[0]` referring to the least significant bit where applicable.\n\nEdge Cases and Additional Considerations:\n- The FSM ensures no race conditions by strictly adhering to positive clock edge triggering.\n- The reset state of all registers within the FSM is explicitly defined to return to the initial pattern search state upon reset.\n- The module is designed to handle continuous streams of input data, effectively restarting the sequence detection upon each successful acknowledgment (`ack`) by the user.\n                    "
