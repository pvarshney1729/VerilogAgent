Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit input, clock signal; all sequential logic triggers on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit input, synchronous active-high reset signal; initializes the FSM state to `000`.\n  - `x`: 1-bit input, influences state transitions.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `z`: 1-bit output, defined by the current state as per the state table.\n\nState Machine Specification:\n- States are encoded as 3-bit vectors `y[2:0]`, where `y[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `y[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- The FSM transitions and output are defined as follows:\n\n| Present State (y[2:0]) | Next State (y[2:0]) if x=0 | Next State (y[2:0]) if x=1 | Output z |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------|\n| 000                    | 000                       | 001                       | 0        |\n| 001                    | 001                       | 100                       | 0        |\n| 010                    | 010                       | 001                       | 0        |\n| 011                    | 001                       | 010                       | 1        |\n| 100                    | 011                       | 100                       | 1        |\n\n- Initial State: On reset, the FSM state is set to `000`.\n\n- Reset Behavior: The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning the FSM transitions to the initial state `000` on the next positive clock edge when `reset` is high.\n\n- Clock Domain: All state transitions are synchronized to the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n- Note: Ensure all signal transitions and state changes occur with respect to the clock edge to prevent race conditions. All registers and flip-flops should be initialized to zero unless otherwise specified.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When `reset` is high, the FSM will not consider the value of `x` and directly transition to the state `000` on the next positive edge of `clk`.\n                    "
