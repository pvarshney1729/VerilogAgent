        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. The module triggers on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `q`: 5-bit wide output vector representing the current state of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The LFSR shifts its bits to the right, utilizing XOR operations at specific bit positions to achieve feedback. This configuration ensures that the LFSR cycles through all possible non-zero states for a 5-bit register, specifically 2^5 - 1 = 31 states, avoiding the all-zero state.\n\n- Bit Indexing Conventions:\n  - `q[4]`: Most Significant Bit (MSB)\n  - `q[0]`: Least Significant Bit (LSB)\n\n- Tap Positions:\n  - Taps are present at bit positions 5 (`q[4]`) and 3 (`q[2]`). The XOR operation involves these positions.\n  - The feedback for the LFSR is calculated by XORing the LSB (`q[0]`) with the tapped positions to determine the new MSB value.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon an active-high synchronous reset, the output `q` of the LFSR is initialized to the binary value `00001`. This ensures the LFSR starts from a known non-zero state.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- On the rising edge of the `clk`, if `reset` is low, the LFSR shifts all bits to the right by one position.\n- The new MSB (`q[4]`) is formed by XORing the current LSB (`q[0]`) with the current values at the tap positions (`q[2]`).\n\nEdge Cases and Race Conditions:\n- The LFSR will not enter the all-zero state due to the careful selection of tap positions and the initialization state.\n- The synchronous reset ensures that any potential race conditions during initialization are avoided, providing a deterministic start state.\n\nThis specification ensures the correctness and clarity needed for Verilog implementation, clearly defining the LFSR's operation, reset behavior, and signal interactions.\n                    "
