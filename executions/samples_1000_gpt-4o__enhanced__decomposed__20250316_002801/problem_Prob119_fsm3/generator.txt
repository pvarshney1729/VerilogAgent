To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to follow these steps:

1. **State Encoding**: Define the states using a 2-bit encoding since there are four states (A, B, C, D). We will use `localparam` to assign binary values to each state for clarity and maintainability.

2. **State Register**: Use a 2-bit register to hold the current state. This register will be updated on the positive edge of the clock or asynchronously reset to state A when `areset` is high.

3. **Next State Logic**: Implement combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This logic will be placed in an `always @(*)` block to ensure it is evaluated whenever any input changes.

4. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. We will use an `always @(*)` block to set the output `out` based on the current state.

5. **Asynchronous Reset**: Implement the asynchronous reset in the sequential logic block to ensure the state is set to A when `areset` is high.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the coding conventions provided, such as using `logic` for signals and not explicitly specifying the sensitivity list for combinational logic.

By following these steps, we can ensure the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions.
