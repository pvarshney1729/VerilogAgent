Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input, used as the clock signal. Positive edge-triggered.\n  - areset: 1-bit input, used as an asynchronous reset. Active high.\n  - in: 1-bit input, used for state transitions.\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output, determined by the current state of the state machine.\n\nState Machine Details:\n- Type: Moore state machine.\n- States: Four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.\n- Initial State: State A upon reset.\n- Reset Behavior: Asynchronous reset using 'areset' input. When 'areset' is high, the state machine transitions immediately to state A regardless of the clock.\n- Clock Behavior: All state transitions occur on the rising edge of 'clk' unless 'areset' is active.\n\nState Transition Table:\n- State A:\n  - Next state if in=0: Remain in State A\n  - Next state if in=1: Transition to State B\n  - Output: 0\n- State B:\n  - Next state if in=0: Transition to State C\n  - Next state if in=1: Remain in State B\n  - Output: 0\n- State C:\n  - Next state if in=0: Transition to State A\n  - Next state if in=1: Transition to State D\n  - Output: 0\n- State D:\n  - Next state if in=0: Transition to State C\n  - Next state if in=1: Transition to State B\n  - Output: 1\n\nAdditional Specifications:\n- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all ports are 1-bit.\n- Signal Precedence: The 'areset' signal has precedence over the 'clk' signal for resetting the state machine.\n- Edge Cases: Ensure correct state transitions and outputs for all possible combinations of 'in' and 'areset' signals.\n                    "

Declare the state register and next state logic using reg [1:0] for state and next_state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nmodule TopModule (\n    input clk,\n    input areset,\n    input in,\n    output reg out\n);\n\n    reg [1:0] state, next_state;\n\n    // State encoding\n    localparam A = 2'b00,\n               B = 2'b01,\n               C = 2'b10,\n               D = 2'b11;\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            A: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ?

Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) to reset the state to A (2'b00) when areset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg [1:0] state;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset) begin\n      state <= 2'b00; // Reset to state A\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on the current state and input in, according to the state transition table.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n    STATE_A = 2'b00,\n    STATE_B = 2'b01,\n    STATE_C = 2'b10,\n    STATE_D = 2'b11\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_A: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ?

STATE_C : STATE_B;\n      default: next_state = STATE_A; // Default case for safety\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statement. Set the output out based on the current state, according to the Moore machine output logic.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// Define state encoding\n  localparam STATE_A = 2'b00;\n  localparam STATE_B = 2'b01;\n  localparam STATE_C = 2'b10;\n  localparam STATE_D = 2'b11;\n\n  reg [1:0] current_state;\n\n  // Output logic based on current state\n  assign out = (current_state == STATE_D) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    "
