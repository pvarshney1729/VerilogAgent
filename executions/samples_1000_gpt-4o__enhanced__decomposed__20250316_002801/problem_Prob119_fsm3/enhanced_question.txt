Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input, used as the clock signal. Positive edge-triggered.
  - areset: 1-bit input, used as an asynchronous reset. Active high.
  - in: 1-bit input, used for state transitions.
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output, determined by the current state of the state machine.

State Machine Details:
- Type: Moore state machine.
- States: Four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.
- Initial State: State A upon reset.
- Reset Behavior: Asynchronous reset using 'areset' input. When 'areset' is high, the state machine transitions immediately to state A regardless of the clock.
- Clock Behavior: All state transitions occur on the rising edge of 'clk' unless 'areset' is active.

State Transition Table:
- State A:
  - Next state if in=0: Remain in State A
  - Next state if in=1: Transition to State B
  - Output: 0
- State B:
  - Next state if in=0: Transition to State C
  - Next state if in=1: Remain in State B
  - Output: 0
- State C:
  - Next state if in=0: Transition to State A
  - Next state if in=1: Transition to State D
  - Output: 0
- State D:
  - Next state if in=0: Transition to State C
  - Next state if in=1: Transition to State B
  - Output: 1

Additional Specifications:
- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all ports are 1-bit.
- Signal Precedence: The 'areset' signal has precedence over the 'clk' signal for resetting the state machine.
- Edge Cases: Ensure correct state transitions and outputs for all possible combinations of 'in' and 'areset' signals.
