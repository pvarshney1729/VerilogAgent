Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `shift_ena`: 1-bit output to enable the shift register.

Functional Description:
- This module is part of a finite state machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.
- The goal is to enable the shift register for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles when a specific bit pattern is detected.
- Upon receiving a synchronous reset signal (`reset` is high at the positive edge of `clk`), the module should assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles and then deassert it indefinitely until another reset occurs.
- While the reset is asserted, `shift_ena` should begin its 4-cycle assertion at the next positive clock edge following the deassertion of reset.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is active-high and synchronous with the clock.
- During reset:
  - All internal state registers should be initialized to ensure `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 cycles after reset.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon power-up, assume any internal state registers are in their reset condition until reset is applied.

Signal Timing and Dependencies:
- The `shift_ena` signal is dependent on the FSM state triggered by the `clk` and `reset` signals.
- Ensure there are no race conditions by resolving signal dependencies in a sequential manner, respecting the clock edges.

Edge Cases:
- If the reset signal is asserted and then deasserted within a very short duration, ensure the 4-cycle assertion behavior is maintained by resetting the internal counters or state registers appropriately.
- After the 4-cycle assertion post-reset, `shift_ena` should remain deasserted (low) indefinitely until the next reset.
