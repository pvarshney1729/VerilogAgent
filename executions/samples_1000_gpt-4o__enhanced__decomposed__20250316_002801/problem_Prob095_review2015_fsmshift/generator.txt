<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles upon reset and then keep it deasserted until the next reset. The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the positive edge of the clock.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a simple counter to track the number of cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted. The counter will be initialized to 4 upon reset and decremented each clock cycle until it reaches zero.

2. **State Transition**: 
   - On reset, the counter is set to 4, and `shift_ena` is asserted.
   - Each clock cycle, the counter is decremented.
   - Once the counter reaches zero, `shift_ena` is deasserted and remains so until the next reset.

3. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` signal is directly driven by whether the counter is non-zero.

4. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the always block will be triggered on the positive edge of the clock for synchronous logic. We will adhere to the convention of using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, although in this case, all logic is sequential.

5. **Initialization**: In simulation, all signals will be initialized to zero unless specified otherwise.

This approach ensures that the `shift_ena` signal behaves as specified, asserting for 4 cycles after a reset and remaining deasserted otherwise.
