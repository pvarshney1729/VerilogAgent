        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `shift_ena`: 1-bit output to enable the shift register.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- This module is part of a finite state machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.\n- The goal is to enable the shift register for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles when a specific bit pattern is detected.\n- Upon receiving a synchronous reset signal (`reset` is high at the positive edge of `clk`), the module should assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles and then deassert it indefinitely until another reset occurs.\n- While the reset is asserted, `shift_ena` should begin its 4-cycle assertion at the next positive clock edge following the deassertion of reset.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is active-high and synchronous with the clock.\n- During reset:\n  - All internal state registers should be initialized to ensure `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 cycles after reset.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up, assume any internal state registers are in their reset condition until reset is applied.\n\nSignal Timing and Dependencies:\n- The `shift_ena` signal is dependent on the FSM state triggered by the `clk` and `reset` signals.\n- Ensure there are no race conditions by resolving signal dependencies in a sequential manner, respecting the clock edges.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the reset signal is asserted and then deasserted within a very short duration, ensure the 4-cycle assertion behavior is maintained by resetting the internal counters or state registers appropriately.\n- After the 4-cycle assertion post-reset, `shift_ena` should remain deasserted (low) indefinitely until the next reset.\n                    "
