        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal; triggers all sequential logic on the positive clock edge.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active high synchronous reset signal; resets all state registers to their initial values on the next positive clock edge when high.\n  - `data`: 1-bit input data stream.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `start_shifting`: 1-bit output signal; set to 1 when the sequence 1101 is detected, and remains 1 until a reset occurs.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the bit sequence \"1101\" in the input `data` stream.\n2. State Encoding:\n   - Define states as follows:\n     - `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the sequence to begin.\n     - `S1`: Detected first '1'.\n     - `S11`: Detected '11'.\n     - `S110`: Detected '110'.\n     - `S1101`: Sequence '1101' detected.\n3. State Transitions:\n   - Transition from `IDLE` to `S1` on detecting '1'.\n   - Transition from `S1` to `S11` on detecting another '1'.\n   - Transition from `S11` to `S110` on detecting '0'.\n   - Transition from `S110` to `S1101` on detecting '1'.\n   - Remain in `S1101` once reached, until reset is applied.\n   - Return to `IDLE` on any incorrect sequence or on reset.\n4. Output Logic:\n   - `start_shifting` should be set to '1' when in state `S1101`.\n   - `start_shifting` should reset to '0' upon activation of the reset signal.\n5. Reset Behavior:\n   - The reset is synchronous; state registers are reset to `IDLE` on the next positive edge of the clock when `reset` is high.\n   - `start_shifting` is also reset to '0' in synchrony with the state reset.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure transitions occur correctly on each clock edge.\n- Reset should take precedence over normal state transitions.\n- Consider the case when `reset` is high at the clock edge to ensure `start_shifting` and state registers are correctly set to their initial values.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Not applicable as all ports are single-bit signals.\n\nNote: The design should avoid race conditions by ensuring transitions and outputs are only affected at the positive edge of the clock.\n                    "
