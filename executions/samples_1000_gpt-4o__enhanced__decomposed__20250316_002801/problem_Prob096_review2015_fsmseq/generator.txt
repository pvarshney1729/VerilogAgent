<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we will design a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence "1101" in the input bit stream. The FSM will have the following states: `IDLE`, `S1`, `S11`, `S110`, and `S1101`. The state transitions will be based on the input `data`. Once the sequence is detected, the FSM will remain in the `S1101` state, and the output `start_shifting` will be set to 1. The reset is synchronous, meaning it will reset the FSM to the `IDLE` state on the next positive clock edge when `reset` is high. We will use `logic` for all signals and follow the coding conventions provided.
