Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal; triggers all sequential logic on the positive clock edge.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active high synchronous reset signal; resets all state registers to their initial values on the next positive clock edge when high.
  - `data`: 1-bit input data stream.

- Output Ports:
  - `start_shifting`: 1-bit output signal; set to 1 when the sequence 1101 is detected, and remains 1 until a reset occurs.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the bit sequence "1101" in the input `data` stream.
2. State Encoding:
   - Define states as follows:
     - `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the sequence to begin.
     - `S1`: Detected first '1'.
     - `S11`: Detected '11'.
     - `S110`: Detected '110'.
     - `S1101`: Sequence '1101' detected.
3. State Transitions:
   - Transition from `IDLE` to `S1` on detecting '1'.
   - Transition from `S1` to `S11` on detecting another '1'.
   - Transition from `S11` to `S110` on detecting '0'.
   - Transition from `S110` to `S1101` on detecting '1'.
   - Remain in `S1101` once reached, until reset is applied.
   - Return to `IDLE` on any incorrect sequence or on reset.
4. Output Logic:
   - `start_shifting` should be set to '1' when in state `S1101`.
   - `start_shifting` should reset to '0' upon activation of the reset signal.
5. Reset Behavior:
   - The reset is synchronous; state registers are reset to `IDLE` on the next positive edge of the clock when `reset` is high.
   - `start_shifting` is also reset to '0' in synchrony with the state reset.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure transitions occur correctly on each clock edge.
- Reset should take precedence over normal state transitions.
- Consider the case when `reset` is high at the clock edge to ensure `start_shifting` and state registers are correctly set to their initial values.

Bit Indexing:
- Not applicable as all ports are single-bit signals.

Note: The design should avoid race conditions by ensuring transitions and outputs are only affected at the positive edge of the clock.
