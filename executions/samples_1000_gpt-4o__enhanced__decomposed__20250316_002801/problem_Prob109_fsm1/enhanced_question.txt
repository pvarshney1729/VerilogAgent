Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. Positive edge-triggered.
  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous reset input. Active high.
  - `in`: 1-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with two states, A and B. The states are encoded as follows:
- State A: Output `out` is 0.
- State B: Output `out` is 1.

State Transition Rules:
- From State B:
  - On input `in = 0`, transition to State A.
  - On input `in = 1`, remain in State B.
- From State A:
  - On input `in = 0`, transition to State B.
  - On input `in = 1`, remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- The state machine asynchronously resets to State B when `areset` is high.

Additional Details:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
- No explicit initial state assignment is required as the asynchronous reset ensures the initial state is State B.
- Ensure that the reset logic is prioritized over state transitions to prevent race conditions during reset.
