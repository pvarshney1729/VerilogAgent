<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The state machine should asynchronously reset to state B when `areset` is high. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, making it a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: We'll use a simple 1-bit encoding for the states: A = 0, B = 1.
2. **State Register**: We'll use an always block triggered on the rising edge of `clk` and the asynchronous reset `areset` to update the current state.
3. **Next State Logic**: We'll use combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.
4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state: 0 for state A and 1 for state B.
5. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset logic will ensure that the state machine transitions to state B when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock.

Following the coding conventions, we'll use `logic` for all signals, and we'll use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.
