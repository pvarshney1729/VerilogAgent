Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. Positive edge-triggered.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous reset input. Active high.\n  - `in`: 1-bit input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output signal.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with two states, A and B. The states are encoded as follows:\n- State A: Output `out` is 0.\n- State B: Output `out` is 1.\n\nState Transition Rules:\n- From State B:\n  - On input `in = 0`, transition to State A.\n  - On input `in = 1`, remain in State B.\n- From State A:\n  - On input `in = 0`, transition to State B.\n  - On input `in = 1`, remain in State A.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The state machine asynchronously resets to State B when `areset` is high.\n\nAdditional Details:\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- No explicit initial state assignment is required as the asynchronous reset ensures the initial state is State B.\n- Ensure that the reset logic is prioritized over state transitions to prevent race conditions during reset.\n                    "

Use reg [1:0] for state and next_state. Define localparam for states A and B with binary encoding (A=2'b00, B=2'b01).\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam A = 2'b00;\n  localparam B = 2'b01;\n\n  // State registers\n  reg [1:0] state, next_state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with asynchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) to set the state to B on reset, otherwise update state to next_state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state, next_state;\n  parameter A = 1'b0, B = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset)\n      state <= B;\n    else\n      state <= next_state;\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*). Define state transitions based on the current state and input in, following the state diagram.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n    STATE_A = 2'b00,\n    STATE_B = 2'b01\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_A: begin\n        if (in)\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n      end\n      STATE_B: begin\n        if (in)\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n      end\n      default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to STATE_B for safety\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statements. Set output out based on the current state: out = 1 for state B, out = 0 for state A.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// Define state encoding\n  parameter A = 1'b0, B = 1'b1;\n  \n  // Declare state register\n  reg state;\n  \n  // Output logic based on current state\n  assign out = (state == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    "
