Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input logic clk: Clock signal, used for state transitions.\n- input logic areset: Active-high asynchronous reset, resets the state machine to the OFF state.\n- input logic j: Input signal that influences state transitions.\n- input logic k: Input signal that influences state transitions.\n- output logic out: Output signal representing the current state.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.\n- The state output is determined solely by the current state (Moore machine).\n\nState Definitions:\n1. OFF State:\n   - Output (out): 0\n   - Transition:\n     - Remain in OFF if j = 0\n     - Transition to ON if j = 1\n\n2. ON State:\n   - Output (out): 1\n   - Transition:\n     - Remain in ON if k = 0\n     - Transition to OFF if k = 1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset (areset) is an active-high asynchronous reset.\n- When areset is asserted (high), the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state, regardless of the clock signal.\n- Upon reset, the output (out) is set to 0.\n\nClock Behavior:\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk).\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon initialization or reset, the state machine starts in the OFF state with out = 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that asynchronous reset (areset) takes priority over any clock-triggered state transitions. When areset is high, the state machine immediately enters the OFF state.\n                    "

Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) for the state transition.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  parameter OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset) begin\n      state <= OFF;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic based on current state and inputs j and k. Use a case statement to handle state transitions according to the state diagram.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      OFF: begin\n        if (j)\n          next_state = ON;\n        else\n          next_state = OFF;\n      end\n      ON: begin\n        if (k)\n          next_state = OFF;\n        else\n          next_state = ON;\n      end\n      default: next_state = OFF; // Default state\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic for the Moore machine. Assign the output 'out' based on the current state using assign statements.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n```verilog\n[BEGIN]\n  // State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // Current state register\n  reg state;\n\n  // Output logic based on current state\n  assign out = (state == ON) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n[END]\n```\n                    "
