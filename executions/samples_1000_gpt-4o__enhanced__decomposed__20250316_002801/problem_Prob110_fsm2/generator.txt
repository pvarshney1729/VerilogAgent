To implement the specified Moore state machine, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The module will have two states, OFF and ON, and will transition between these states based on the inputs `j` and `k`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a single bit to represent the two states: OFF (0) and ON (1).

2. **State Register**: We'll use a sequential always block to update the state on the rising edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset is asserted. The reset will set the state to OFF.

3. **Next State Logic**: A combinational always block will determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` will be assigned based on the current state. If the state is ON, `out` will be 1; otherwise, it will be 0.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We'll use `logic` for all signals, and adhere to the guidelines for combinational and sequential logic.

6. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset will be active-high and asynchronous, ensuring that the state transitions to OFF immediately when asserted.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the module behaves as specified.
