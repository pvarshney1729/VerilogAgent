Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input logic clk: Clock signal, used for state transitions.
- input logic areset: Active-high asynchronous reset, resets the state machine to the OFF state.
- input logic j: Input signal that influences state transitions.
- input logic k: Input signal that influences state transitions.
- output logic out: Output signal representing the current state.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- The state output is determined solely by the current state (Moore machine).

State Definitions:
1. OFF State:
   - Output (out): 0
   - Transition:
     - Remain in OFF if j = 0
     - Transition to ON if j = 1

2. ON State:
   - Output (out): 1
   - Transition:
     - Remain in ON if k = 0
     - Transition to OFF if k = 1

Reset Behavior:
- The reset (areset) is an active-high asynchronous reset.
- When areset is asserted (high), the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state, regardless of the clock signal.
- Upon reset, the output (out) is set to 0.

Clock Behavior:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk).

Signal Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Initial Conditions:
- Upon initialization or reset, the state machine starts in the OFF state with out = 0.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that asynchronous reset (areset) takes priority over any clock-triggered state transitions. When areset is high, the state machine immediately enters the OFF state.
