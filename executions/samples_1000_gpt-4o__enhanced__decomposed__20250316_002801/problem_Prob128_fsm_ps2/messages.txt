        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Specifications:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- `input reset`: Active-high, synchronous reset.\n- `input [7:0] in`: 8-bit data input, where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n- `output done`: Single-bit output signal, asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte of a message is received.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to detect the start and end of PS/2 mouse protocol messages in a continuous byte stream. Each message consists of exactly three bytes. The FSM operates according to the following rules and conditions:\n\n1. **Message Detection**:\n   - Continuously monitor the input byte stream.\n   - The start of a message is identified by a byte where `in[3] = 1`.\n   - Once a start byte is detected, the FSM assumes it is the first byte of a message.\n\n2. **Byte Counting**:\n   - After detecting a start byte (`in[3] = 1`), count the subsequent bytes to complete the message.\n   - The FSM transitions through states corresponding to receiving the first, second, and third bytes of the message.\n\n3. **Done Signal**:\n   - The `done` output is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte of a message is successfully received.\n\n4. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - On receiving a synchronous active-high reset, the FSM returns to its initial state, discarding any partially received message data.\n\n5. **Clock and Timing**:\n   - All sequential logic transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n   - Ensure the FSM handles edge cases, such as resets occurring mid-message, by resetting the byte count and FSM state.\n\nFSM State Details:\n- **Initial State**: Await detection of a start byte (`in[3] = 1`).\n- **State 1**: Start byte detected; awaiting second byte.\n- **State 2**: Second byte received; awaiting third byte.\n- **Final State**: Third byte received; assert `done` high for one clock cycle and transition back to the initial state.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- If a reset is asserted during message reception, discard the current message and return to the initial state.\n- If an unexpected byte (without `in[3] = 1`) is received in the initial state, continue monitoring for a start byte.\n\nThe FSM should be designed to avoid race conditions and ensure reliable message boundary detection within the constraints of the PS/2 mouse protocol.\n                    "
