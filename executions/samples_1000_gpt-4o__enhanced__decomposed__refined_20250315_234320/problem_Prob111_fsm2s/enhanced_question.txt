Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: Clock signal (1 bit)
  - reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal (1 bit)
  - j: Input signal for state transition (1 bit)
  - k: Input signal for state transition (1 bit)
- Output Ports:
  - out: State output signal (1 bit)

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- States:
  - OFF: Output `out` is 0
  - ON: Output `out` is 1
- State Transitions:
  - From OFF:
    - If j = 0, remain in OFF
    - If j = 1, transition to ON
  - From ON:
    - If k = 0, remain in ON
    - If k = 1, transition to OFF

Additional Specifications:
- Reset Behavior: 
  - The reset is a synchronous reset, active-high.
  - Upon reset activation, the state transitions to OFF regardless of inputs.
- Clock Cycle Operation:
  - State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- Initial State:
  - At power-up, without a reset condition, the initial state of the state machine is undefined and must be controlled by the reset signal.
- Signal Conventions:
  - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit if applicable.
  - Inputs j and k determine the next state based on the current state and are evaluated at each rising edge of the clk.
- Edge Cases:
  - The state machine correctly handles all combinations of input signals j and k.
- No race conditions are expected given the synchronous nature of the state transitions and reset.
