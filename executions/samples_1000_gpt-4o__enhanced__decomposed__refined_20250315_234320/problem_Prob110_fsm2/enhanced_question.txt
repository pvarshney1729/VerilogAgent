Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, active on the rising edge.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the state machine to the initial state (OFF).
  - `input j`: Input signal for state transition from OFF to ON.
  - `input k`: Input signal for state transition from ON to OFF.
- Output Ports:
  - `output out`: Output signal representing the current state (0 for OFF, 1 for ON).

Specifications:
1. State Machine Type: Moore
2. States:
   - State `OFF`: 
     - Output `out` = 0
     - Transitions:
       - Remain in `OFF` when `j = 0`
       - Transition to `ON` when `j = 1`
   - State `ON`: 
     - Output `out` = 1
     - Transitions:
       - Remain in `ON` when `k = 0`
       - Transition to `OFF` when `k = 1`

3. Reset Behavior:
   - Reset Type: Asynchronous
   - Reset Condition: Active-high signal on `areset`.
   - Reset Action: Immediately transitions the state machine to the `OFF` state, regardless of the clock.

4. Clock Domain:
   - The state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
   - The state output (`out`) is updated at the same clock edge as the state transition.

5. Initial Conditions:
   - On reset (`areset` = 1), the initial state is `OFF` with `out` = 0.

6. Additional Considerations:
   - Inputs `j` and `k` are evaluated only on the rising edge of the `clk` unless `areset` is active.
   - Ensure correct handling of race conditions by prioritizing the `areset` signal over clock-induced transitions.
   - All transitions and outputs should adhere strictly to the state transition diagram described.

This specification ensures a clear implementation of the Moore state machine with well-defined input, output, and reset behaviors.
