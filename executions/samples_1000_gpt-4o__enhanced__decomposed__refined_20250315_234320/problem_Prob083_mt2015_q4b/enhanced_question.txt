Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: `x` (1-bit, unsigned)
- Input: `y` (1-bit, unsigned)
- Output: `z` (1-bit, unsigned)

Timing and Behavioral Specification:
- The output `z` is determined by the current values of inputs `x` and `y` according to the waveform pattern described below.
- The module operates on combinational logic; there are no clock or sequential elements involved.

Truth Table (derived from simulation waveform):
| x | y | z |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Operation Description:
- When both `x` and `y` are 0, the output `z` is 1.
- When `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, the output `z` is 0.
- When `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, the output `z` is 0.
- When both `x` and `y` are 1, the output `z` is 1.

Additional Notes:
- Bit indexing convention: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.
- Ensure that the combinational logic implements the above truth table accurately.
- All operations should consider potential race conditions, though none are expected in this simple combinational logic.
- The design should handle all possible input combinations and ensure deterministic output.
