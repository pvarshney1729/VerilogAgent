        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic operations occur on the rising edge of this clock.\n  - load: 1-bit control input. When high, it loads the counter with the specified data.\n  - data: 10-bit unsigned input. Represents the number of clock cycles for which the timer should count down.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - tc: 1-bit output. Terminal count signal indicating the counter has reached zero.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- The input data[9:0] is a 10-bit unsigned number, where data[9] is the most significant bit (MSB) and data[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nOperational Description:\n1. Counter Initialization and Behavior:\n   - The internal counter is a 10-bit register initialized to zero during the first clock cycle or after a reset.\n   - Reset behavior is not explicitly specified; therefore, the counter assumes zero on power-up only.\n\n2. Load Operation:\n   - On each positive edge of the clk:\n     - If load is high (1), the internal counter is loaded with the 10-bit input data[9:0].\n     - This operation will overwrite the current counter value regardless of its current state.\n\n3. Countdown Operation:\n   - If load is low (0), the internal counter decrements by 1 on each rising edge of clk.\n   - The counter stops decrementing once it reaches zero and maintains a zero value until a new load operation occurs.\n\n4. Output Signal:\n   - The tc output is high (1) when the counter reaches zero and remains high until the counter is loaded again.\n   - The tc signal is updated synchronously with the clk on each positive edge.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- If the counter is loaded with zero, tc will immediately be set high (1) after the next clock cycle.\n- If the counter is decremented from a non-zero value that is not loaded, it will count down to zero at which point tc will be asserted.\n\nSequential Logic and Flip-Flops:\n- The module uses a single D flip-flop for the output tc signal, updated on the rising edge of clk based on the counter reaching zero.\n- Ensure all sequential elements are properly initialized to prevent undefined behavior.\n\nRace Conditions:\n- The design ensures that loading and counting operations do not interfere with each other due to synchronous clock edge operation.\n                    "
