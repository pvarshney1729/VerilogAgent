Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic operations occur on the rising edge of this clock.
  - load: 1-bit control input. When high, it loads the counter with the specified data.
  - data: 10-bit unsigned input. Represents the number of clock cycles for which the timer should count down.

- Output Ports:
  - tc: 1-bit output. Terminal count signal indicating the counter has reached zero.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- The input data[9:0] is a 10-bit unsigned number, where data[9] is the most significant bit (MSB) and data[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Operational Description:
1. Counter Initialization and Behavior:
   - The internal counter is a 10-bit register initialized to zero during the first clock cycle or after a reset.
   - Reset behavior is not explicitly specified; therefore, the counter assumes zero on power-up only.

2. Load Operation:
   - On each positive edge of the clk:
     - If load is high (1), the internal counter is loaded with the 10-bit input data[9:0].
     - This operation will overwrite the current counter value regardless of its current state.

3. Countdown Operation:
   - If load is low (0), the internal counter decrements by 1 on each rising edge of clk.
   - The counter stops decrementing once it reaches zero and maintains a zero value until a new load operation occurs.

4. Output Signal:
   - The tc output is high (1) when the counter reaches zero and remains high until the counter is loaded again.
   - The tc signal is updated synchronously with the clk on each positive edge.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- If the counter is loaded with zero, tc will immediately be set high (1) after the next clock cycle.
- If the counter is decremented from a non-zero value that is not loaded, it will count down to zero at which point tc will be asserted.

Sequential Logic and Flip-Flops:
- The module uses a single D flip-flop for the output tc signal, updated on the rising edge of clk based on the counter reaching zero.
- Ensure all sequential elements are properly initialized to prevent undefined behavior.

Race Conditions:
- The design ensures that loading and counting operations do not interfere with each other due to synchronous clock edge operation.
