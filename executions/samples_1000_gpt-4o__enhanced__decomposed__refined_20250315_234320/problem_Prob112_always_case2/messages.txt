        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPurpose:\nThe TopModule implements a 4-bit priority encoder. This combinational circuit outputs the position of the first high ('1') bit from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). If no bits are high (i.e., all inputs are '0'), the output should be zero.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `in` (4 bits, unsigned): Input vector where `in[3]` is the MSB and `in[0]` is the LSB.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `pos` (2 bits, unsigned): Output vector representing the binary position of the first high bit from the input vector. When all input bits are '0', `pos` should output 2'b00.\n\nPriority Encoder Functionality:\n1. The module examines the input vector `in` from MSB to LSB.\n2. It outputs a 2-bit binary number representing the position of the first '1' encountered.\n3. The priority is given such that `in[3]` has the highest priority and `in[0]` has the lowest priority.\n\nBehavior:\n- If `in[3]` is '1', `pos` outputs 2'b11 (3 in decimal).\n- If `in[3]` is '0' and `in[2]` is '1', `pos` outputs 2'b10 (2 in decimal).\n- If `in[3]` and `in[2]` are '0' and `in[1]` is '1', `pos` outputs 2'b01 (1 in decimal).\n- If `in[3]`, `in[2]`, and `in[1]` are '0' and `in[0]` is '1', `pos` outputs 2'b00 (0 in decimal).\n- If all input bits are '0', `pos` outputs 2'b00.\n\nThis specification assumes that the priority encoder is purely combinational logic with no clock or reset signals involved.\n                    "
