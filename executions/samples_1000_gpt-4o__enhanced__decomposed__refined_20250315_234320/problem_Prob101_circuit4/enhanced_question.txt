Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The module, TopModule, is designed as a combinational logic circuit. It determines the output 'q' based on the logic states of the inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The functionality is derived from the provided simulation waveform data.

Port Definitions:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a; // Single-bit input
  - input wire b; // Single-bit input
  - input wire c; // Single-bit input
  - input wire d; // Single-bit input
- Output Ports:
  - output wire q; // Single-bit output

Operational Details:
- The circuit is purely combinational, meaning there are no clocked elements (flip-flops or registers) involved.
- The truth table below defines the logic for the output 'q' based on the inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.

Truth Table:
| a | b | c | d | q |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- Signal Dependencies:
  - The output 'q' is determined directly by the combination of inputs at any given time.
  - Priority of evaluation or precedence of operations is not applicable as there are no sequential operations.

- Edge Cases:
  - All possible input combinations are covered in the truth table.

Note:
- All inputs and outputs are to be treated as unsigned signals.
- The bit indexing is not applicable as each input and output is a single bit.
