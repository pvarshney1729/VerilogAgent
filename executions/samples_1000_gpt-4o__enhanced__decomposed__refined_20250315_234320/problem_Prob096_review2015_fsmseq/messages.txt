        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset. Resets all state elements to their initial state.\n  - data: 1-bit input stream.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - start_shifting: 1-bit output that is set to '1' when the sequence is detected and remains '1' until reset.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the sequence '1101' in the input bit stream 'data'. The FSM transitions between states based on the input sequence and sets the output 'start_shifting' to '1' upon detecting the sequence.\n\nFSM States:\n1. IDLE: Initial state. Transition to state S1 on receiving '1'.\n2. S1: Transition to S11 on receiving '1'. Otherwise, return to IDLE.\n3. S11: Transition to S110 on receiving '0'. If '1', remain in S11.\n4. S110: Transition to DETECT on receiving '1'. If '0', return to IDLE.\n5. DETECT: Output 'start_shifting' is set to '1'. Remain in this state until reset.\n\nState Transition Logic:\n- On each positive edge of 'clk', the FSM evaluates transitions based on the input 'data'.\n- The 'reset' signal, when high, forces a transition to the IDLE state and resets 'start_shifting' to '0'.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output 'start_shifting' is set to '1' when the FSM enters the DETECT state. It remains '1' until a reset occurs.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- If the sequence is detected just before a reset, 'start_shifting' resets to '0'.\n- The FSM correctly handles overlapping sequences, ensuring continuous operation in detecting subsequent patterns.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All signals in the module are single-bit wide, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On reset, the FSM starts in the IDLE state. The output 'start_shifting' is initialized to '0'.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input 'data' stream is valid on each clock cycle.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
