Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset. Resets all state elements to their initial state.
  - data: 1-bit input stream.

- Output Ports:
  - start_shifting: 1-bit output that is set to '1' when the sequence is detected and remains '1' until reset.

Functional Description:
The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the sequence '1101' in the input bit stream 'data'. The FSM transitions between states based on the input sequence and sets the output 'start_shifting' to '1' upon detecting the sequence.

FSM States:
1. IDLE: Initial state. Transition to state S1 on receiving '1'.
2. S1: Transition to S11 on receiving '1'. Otherwise, return to IDLE.
3. S11: Transition to S110 on receiving '0'. If '1', remain in S11.
4. S110: Transition to DETECT on receiving '1'. If '0', return to IDLE.
5. DETECT: Output 'start_shifting' is set to '1'. Remain in this state until reset.

State Transition Logic:
- On each positive edge of 'clk', the FSM evaluates transitions based on the input 'data'.
- The 'reset' signal, when high, forces a transition to the IDLE state and resets 'start_shifting' to '0'.

Output Logic:
- The output 'start_shifting' is set to '1' when the FSM enters the DETECT state. It remains '1' until a reset occurs.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- If the sequence is detected just before a reset, 'start_shifting' resets to '0'.
- The FSM correctly handles overlapping sequences, ensuring continuous operation in detecting subsequent patterns.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals in the module are single-bit wide, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.

Initial Conditions:
- On reset, the FSM starts in the IDLE state. The output 'start_shifting' is initialized to '0'.

Assumptions:
- The input 'data' stream is valid on each clock cycle.
