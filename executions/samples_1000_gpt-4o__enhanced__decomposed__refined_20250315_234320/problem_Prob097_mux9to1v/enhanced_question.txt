Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The objective is to design a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. The module selects one of the nine 16-bit inputs (a to i) based on a 4-bit selector input (sel). For any selector value outside the range of 0 to 8, the output should be set to all '1's.

Port Definitions:
- Inputs:
  - input [15:0] a: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] b: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] c: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] d: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] e: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] f: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] g: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] h: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [15:0] i: 16-bit input signal.
  - input [3:0] sel: 4-bit selector input.

- Output:
  - output [15:0] out: 16-bit output signal.

Behavioral Specification:
- The output 'out' is determined based on the value of the 'sel' input.
- Selection Logic:
  - If sel is 0, 'out' is assigned the value of 'a'.
  - If sel is 1, 'out' is assigned the value of 'b'.
  - If sel is 2, 'out' is assigned the value of 'c'.
  - If sel is 3, 'out' is assigned the value of 'd'.
  - If sel is 4, 'out' is assigned the value of 'e'.
  - If sel is 5, 'out' is assigned the value of 'f'.
  - If sel is 6, 'out' is assigned the value of 'g'.
  - If sel is 7, 'out' is assigned the value of 'h'.
  - If sel is 8, 'out' is assigned the value of 'i'.
  - For sel values in the range of 9 to 15, 'out' should be set to 16'b1111_1111_1111_1111 (all bits set to '1').

Additional Considerations:
- The bit indexing convention used is as follows: bit[15] refers to the most significant bit (MSB) and bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- This specification assumes a purely combinational logic design for the multiplexer with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.
- Ensure that operations are not susceptible to race conditions by maintaining a clear priority order based on the sel value.
