Module Name: TopModule

Input Ports:
- clk: 1-bit input, serves as the clock signal triggering sequential logic on the rising edge.
- load: 1-bit input, controls whether the system state should be updated with new data.
- data: 512-bit input, used to initialize the system state when 'load' is asserted.

Output Ports:
- q: 512-bit output, represents the current state of the 512-cell system.

Functional Description:
- The module implements Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton, wherein each cell's next state is determined by the XOR of its two current neighbors.
- For a given cell indexed at 'i', the next state q[i] is computed as follows:
  - q[i] = q[i-1] XOR q[i+1].

Boundary Conditions:
- It is assumed that the boundary conditions q[-1] and q[512] are both zero (off).

Operational Behavior:
- On the rising edge of the clock ('clk'), the following occurs:
  - If 'load' is high (1), the current state of the system is initialized to 'data[511:0]'.
  - If 'load' is low (0), the state of the system advances by one time step according to Rule 90.

Notes:
- All sequential elements (flip-flops/registers) are sensitive to the positive edge of the clock.
- The system does not require a reset signal. Initial loading with 'data' serves as the initialization.
- Bit indexing follows the convention q[0] as the least significant bit and q[511] as the most significant bit.

Edge Cases:
- When computing the next state for the boundary cells, assume:
  - The "left" neighbor of q[0] is q[-1] = 0.
  - The "right" neighbor of q[511] is q[512] = 0.
