        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInput Ports:\n- clk: 1-bit input, serves as the clock signal triggering sequential logic on the rising edge.\n- load: 1-bit input, controls whether the system state should be updated with new data.\n- data: 512-bit input, used to initialize the system state when 'load' is asserted.\n\nOutput Ports:\n- q: 512-bit output, represents the current state of the 512-cell system.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton, wherein each cell's next state is determined by the XOR of its two current neighbors.\n- For a given cell indexed at 'i', the next state q[i] is computed as follows:\n  - q[i] = q[i-1] XOR q[i+1].\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- It is assumed that the boundary conditions q[-1] and q[512] are both zero (off).\n\nOperational Behavior:\n- On the rising edge of the clock ('clk'), the following occurs:\n  - If 'load' is high (1), the current state of the system is initialized to 'data[511:0]'.\n  - If 'load' is low (0), the state of the system advances by one time step according to Rule 90.\n\nNotes:\n- All sequential elements (flip-flops/registers) are sensitive to the positive edge of the clock.\n- The system does not require a reset signal. Initial loading with 'data' serves as the initialization.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention q[0] as the least significant bit and q[511] as the most significant bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When computing the next state for the boundary cells, assume:\n  - The \"left\" neighbor of q[0] is q[-1] = 0.\n  - The \"right\" neighbor of q[511] is q[512] = 0.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
