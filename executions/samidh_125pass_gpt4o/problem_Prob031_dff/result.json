The flip-flop captures the value of the input 'd' \n// on the rising edge of the clock 'clk' and holds this value on the output 'q' until the next rising edge. \n\n// Assumptions and Conventions:\n// - All signals are active high.\n// - Bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) for any multi-bit signals (if applicable).\n\n// Reset Behavior:\n// - This module does not include an asynchronous or synchronous reset. \n//   If a reset is required, it must be handled externally or added as additional functionality.\n\n// Flip-Flop Initial State:\n// - The initial state of 'q' is undefined upon power-up and may depend on the synthesis tool or FPGA/CPLD behavior.\n//   If a defined initial state is required, a reset mechanism should be integrated.\n\n// Timing Behavior:\n// - The flip-flop is positive edge-triggered. It captures the input 'd' at the exact moment the 'clk' signal transitions\n//   from low to high (positive edge).\n// - Users must ensure setup and hold times are adhered to with respect to 'clk' to prevent metastability.\n\nalways_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n    q <= d;  // On the rising edge of clk, capture the value of 'd' into 'q'\nend\n\nendmodule",
