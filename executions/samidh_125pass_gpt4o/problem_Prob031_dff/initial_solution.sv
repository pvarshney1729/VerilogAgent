module TopModule (
    input logic clk,       // Clock input, assumes a single bit width, active on the positive edge
    input logic d,         // Data input for the D flip-flop
    output logic q         // Data output of the D flip-flop
);

// Module Description:
// This module implements a single D flip-flop. The flip-flop captures the value of the input 'd' 
// on the rising edge of the clock 'clk' and holds this value on the output 'q' until the next rising edge. 

// Assumptions and Conventions:
// - All signals are active high.
// - Bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) for any multi-bit signals (if applicable).

// Reset Behavior:
// - This module does not include an asynchronous or synchronous reset. 
//   If a reset is required, it must be handled externally or added as additional functionality.

// Flip-Flop Initial State:
// - The initial state of 'q' is undefined upon power-up and may depend on the synthesis tool or FPGA/CPLD behavior.
//   If a defined initial state is required, a reset mechanism should be integrated.

// Timing Behavior:
// - The flip-flop is positive edge-triggered. It captures the input 'd' at the exact moment the 'clk' signal transitions
//   from low to high (positive edge).
// - Users must ensure setup and hold times are adhered to with respect to 'clk' to prevent metastability.

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d;  // On the rising edge of clk, capture the value of 'd' into 'q'
