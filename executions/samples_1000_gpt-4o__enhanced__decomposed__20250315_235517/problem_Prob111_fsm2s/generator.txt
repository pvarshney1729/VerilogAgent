<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are controlled by inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` depends only on the current state. The reset is a synchronous reset that sets the state to OFF.

1. **State Encoding**: We'll use a 1-bit register to represent the states, where `0` represents OFF and `1` represents ON.
2. **State Transition Logic**: We'll use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to update the state. If `reset` is high, the state is set to OFF. Otherwise, the next state is determined by the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.
3. **Next State Logic**: We'll use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs.
4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. In state OFF, `out` is 0, and in state ON, `out` is 1.
5. **Coding Conventions**: We'll use `logic` for all signals, and adhere to the guidelines for synchronous reset and combinational logic.

The implementation will strictly follow the provided interface and signal names, ensuring that the synchronous reset and state transitions are correctly implemented.
