Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input.
  - j: 1-bit input signal to control state transitions.
  - k: 1-bit input signal to control state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output that represents the current state output.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- The state transitions are governed by inputs j and k as described below.
- The reset input synchronously resets the state to OFF.

State Definitions:
- State OFF: 
  - Output: out = 0
  - Transitions:
    - If j = 0, remain in OFF.
    - If j = 1, transition to ON.

- State ON:
  - Output: out = 1
  - Transitions:
    - If k = 0, remain in ON.
    - If k = 1, transition to OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- An active-high synchronous reset sets the state to OFF, making the output 'out' equal to 0.
- The reset signal takes precedence over input signals j and k but is only effective on the rising edge of the clock.

Signal and Register Definitions:
- State Register: A 1-bit register to hold the current state. Initial value is OFF (0).
- The state register is updated on the rising edge of clk.

Bit Indexing:
- All ports are single bit, hence no specific bit indexing is required.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The behavior of the module is fully defined for all combinations of j and k inputs due to the synchronous nature of the state transitions and reset.
