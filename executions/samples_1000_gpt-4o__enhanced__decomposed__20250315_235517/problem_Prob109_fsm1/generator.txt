<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input signal 'in'. The machine should asynchronously reset to state B when 'areset' is high. The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state: it is 0 in state A and 1 in state B.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a single bit to represent the states, where 0 represents state A and 1 represents state B.
2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The state machine should transition to state B when 'areset' is high, regardless of the clock.
3. **State Transition Logic**: 
   - From state B, if 'in' is 0, transition to state A; if 'in' is 1, remain in state B.
   - From state A, if 'in' is 0, transition to state B; if 'in' is 1, remain in state A.
4. **Output Logic**: The output 'out' is 0 in state A and 1 in state B.
5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and `always @(*)` for combinational logic. The sequential block should only include `posedge clk` and `areset` for asynchronous reset.

The implementation will follow these steps to ensure the correct behavior of the state machine.
