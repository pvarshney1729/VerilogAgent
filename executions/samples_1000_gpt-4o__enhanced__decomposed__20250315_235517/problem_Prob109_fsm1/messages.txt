Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Descriptions:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal, used for synchronous state transitions.\n- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the state machine to the initial state.\n- input wire in: Input signal that determines state transitions.\n- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state's output value.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- This is a Moore state machine with two states, A and B.\n- State Representation: \n  - State A is encoded as 1'b0.\n  - State B is encoded as 1'b1.\n\nTransition and Output Logic:\n- Initial State: On an asynchronous reset (areset = 1), the state machine transitions to state B immediately, regardless of the clock.\n- State Transitions:\n  - From State B (out = 1):\n    - If in = 0, transition to State A.\n    - If in = 1, remain in State B.\n  - From State A (out = 0):\n    - If in = 0, transition to State B.\n    - If in = 1, remain in State A.\n- Output Logic: \n  - The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state.\n  - In State A, out = 0.\n  - In State B, out = 1.\n\nAdditional Specifications:\n- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal except for asynchronous reset, which takes precedence.\n- This module does not use any additional initialization as the asynchronous reset ensures the start in State B.\n- The design assumes no race conditions due to the simplicity of the state machine and the use of an asynchronous reset.\n                    "
