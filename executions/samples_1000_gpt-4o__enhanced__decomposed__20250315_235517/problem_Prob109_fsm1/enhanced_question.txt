Module Name: TopModule

Port Descriptions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, used for synchronous state transitions.
- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the state machine to the initial state.
- input wire in: Input signal that determines state transitions.
- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state's output value.

State Machine Description:
- This is a Moore state machine with two states, A and B.
- State Representation: 
  - State A is encoded as 1'b0.
  - State B is encoded as 1'b1.

Transition and Output Logic:
- Initial State: On an asynchronous reset (areset = 1), the state machine transitions to state B immediately, regardless of the clock.
- State Transitions:
  - From State B (out = 1):
    - If in = 0, transition to State A.
    - If in = 1, remain in State B.
  - From State A (out = 0):
    - If in = 0, transition to State B.
    - If in = 1, remain in State A.
- Output Logic: 
  - The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state.
  - In State A, out = 0.
  - In State B, out = 1.

Additional Specifications:
- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are single-bit.
- All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal except for asynchronous reset, which takes precedence.
- This module does not use any additional initialization as the asynchronous reset ensures the start in State B.
- The design assumes no race conditions due to the simplicity of the state machine and the use of an asynchronous reset.
