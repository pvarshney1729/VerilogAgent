To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to design a finite-state machine (FSM) that handles the detection of the pattern `1101`, shifts in 4 additional bits, waits for a counting process to complete, and then notifies the user. The FSM will transition through several states: IDLE, DETECT_1, DETECT_11, DETECT_110, DETECT_1101, SHIFT, COUNT, and DONE. Each state will have specific actions associated with it, such as asserting outputs like `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done`. The FSM will use a synchronous reset and will be clocked on the positive edge of `clk`. The `shift_ena` will be asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles after detecting the pattern `1101`. The `counting` signal will be asserted while waiting for `done_counting` to go high, and the `done` signal will be asserted until `ack` is received. The FSM will then reset to the IDLE state to look for the next occurrence of the pattern.
