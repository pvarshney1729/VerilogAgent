        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronization, positive-edge triggered.\n  - `input reset`: Active high, synchronous reset signal.\n  - `input data`: Serial data input for pattern detection.\n  - `input done_counting`: Signal indicating the completion of the counting process.\n  - `input ack`: Acknowledgment signal from the user.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output shift_ena`: Signal to enable shifting operation for 4 clock cycles.\n  - `output counting`: Signal indicating the state machine is waiting for counters to finish.\n  - `output done`: Signal to notify the user that the timer has completed timing.\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. **Pattern Detection**: The state machine monitors the `data` input for the specific sequence '1101'. Upon detection, the state transitions to start the delay process.\n\n2. **Shift Enable**: After detecting the pattern '1101', the state machine asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles to allow shifting of additional bits determining the delay duration.\n\n3. **Counting Phase**: Once the 4-bit shift is complete, the state machine asserts `counting`, indicating that it is waiting for the counting process to finish. The state machine remains in this state until `done_counting` is asserted high.\n\n4. **Completion Notification**: Upon receiving a high `done_counting` signal, the state machine asserts `done`, notifying the user that the timer has timed out.\n\n5. **Acknowledgment and Reset**: The state machine waits for the user to acknowledge by setting `ack` high. Once acknowledged, the state machine resets and begins searching for the next occurrence of the start sequence '1101'.\n\nReset and Initialization:\n- The state machine is initialized and reset synchronously with the `reset` signal. Upon reset, the state machine returns to its initial state, ready to detect the pattern '1101'.\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\nNote:\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- All operations and state transitions are synchronous with the clock signal `clk`.\n- There should be no race conditions given the positive-edge triggering and synchronous reset design.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure that any noise or glitches on the `data` input do not falsely trigger the pattern detection by using robust filtering logic or debouncing as necessary.\n- The state machine should handle continuous input streams and reset correctly after each complete timer cycle without missing any pattern occurrences.\n                    "
