<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to follow the state transition and output logic derived from the given state machine description. The module uses a one-hot encoding for states, which simplifies the logic for state transitions and outputs. Each state is represented by a single bit in a 10-bit vector, with only one bit being high at any time.

The state transitions are determined by the inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack`, and the current state. The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are determined by the current state.

The next state logic is implemented using combinational logic, and the outputs are directly derived from the current state. We will use `always @(*)` blocks for combinational logic to ensure that the logic is evaluated whenever any input changes.

The module will have the following components:
1. State encoding using local parameters.
2. Combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs.
3. Combinational logic to determine the outputs based on the current state.

We will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals and using `always @(*)` for combinational logic.
