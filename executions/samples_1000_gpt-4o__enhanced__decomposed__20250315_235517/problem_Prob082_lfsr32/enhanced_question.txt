Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit, clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
  - `reset`: 1-bit, active high synchronous reset signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 32-bit unsigned output vector.

Behavior:
1. The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
2. The Galois LFSR shifts the register contents to the right by one position per clock cycle.
3. Tap positions are defined at the following bit indices (using 1-based indexing for clarity): 32, 22, 2, and 1. These correspond to the 31st, 21st, 1st, and 0th indices in 0-based indexing.
4. The bit at the least significant bit position (`q[0]`) is XORed with the values at the tap positions to produce the next state of the LFSR.
5. During normal operation (when `reset` is low):
   - The next state for each bit `q[i]` is determined as follows:
     - `q[31:1]` shifts right by one position, i.e., `q[31] = q[30], q[30] = q[29], ..., q[1] = q[0]`.
     - `q[0]` is the XOR of `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.
6. On a synchronous reset (`reset` is high on the positive edge of `clk`):
   - The output `q` is set to the initial value `32'h1`.

Assumptions:
- Bit indexing is 0-based, with `bit[31]` being the most significant bit and `bit[0]` being the least significant bit.
- The reset operation takes precedence over normal operation and is synchronous with the clock signal.
- The initial value of the LFSR on reset ensures the LFSR does not lock into the all-zero state.

Edge Cases:
- The initial value on reset prevents the LFSR from entering a non-functional state.
- Ensure XOR operations are correctly implemented to maintain the Galois configuration integrity, avoiding any potential race conditions.

This specification is designed to provide a clear, unambiguous description of the required functionality for a Galois LFSR implementation.
