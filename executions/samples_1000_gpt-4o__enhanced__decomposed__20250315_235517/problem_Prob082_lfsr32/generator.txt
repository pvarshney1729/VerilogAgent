<REASONING>
To implement the 32-bit Galois LFSR as specified, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define a module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The output `q` is a 32-bit vector.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the output `q` to `32'h1` when the `reset` signal is high on the rising edge of `clk`.

3. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the Galois LFSR logic. The LFSR shifts right, and the taps are at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. The least significant bit (`q[0]`) is XORed with the tapped positions to generate the new value for `q[31]`.

4. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to implement the sequential logic for the LFSR.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the given coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and not specifying the sensitivity list for combinational logic.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions provided.
