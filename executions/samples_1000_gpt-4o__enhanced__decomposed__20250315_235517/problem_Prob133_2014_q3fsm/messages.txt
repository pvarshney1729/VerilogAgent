Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- input reset: Asynchronous active-high reset.\n- input s: State transition control input.\n- input w: Input for FSM evaluation.\n- output reg z: Output signal, 1-bit wide.\n\nFSM Specification:\n1. Initial State: The FSM begins in state A upon reset.\n2. State A:\n   - Remains in state A as long as input s = 0.\n   - Transitions to state B when s = 1 on the next positive clock edge.\n3. State B:\n   - The FSM evaluates input w over the following three consecutive clock cycles.\n   - If w = 1 exactly two times within these three clock cycles, set output z to 1 in the fourth clock cycle.\n   - If this condition is not met, set z to 0 in the fourth clock cycle.\n   - The FSM continues to evaluate w over each subsequent set of three clock cycles while in state B.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous. Upon activation, the FSM returns to state A, and output z is reset to 0.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential elements are triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal.\n\nSignal Details:\n- z is a registered output, explicitly set to 0 upon reset.\n- The FSM logic uses a counter or similar mechanism to track the number of clock cycles and occurrences of w = 1 within those cycles.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All single-bit signals: no specific indexing required.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure the FSM handles transitions correctly when s changes on the clock edge.\n- Confirm that w is evaluated correctly across clock cycles.\n\nThe FSM should utilize minimal states beyond A and B to fulfill the specified behavior.\n                    "
