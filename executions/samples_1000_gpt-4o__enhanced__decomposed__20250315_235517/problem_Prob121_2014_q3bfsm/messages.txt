        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The goal is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a specific interface and behavior. The module features a finite-state machine (FSM) with defined state transitions and output logic. Below are the refined specifications:\n\n**Module Interface:**\n- **Inputs:**\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input reset`: Synchronous reset signal, active high.\n  - `input x`: Control input signal.\n\n- **Outputs:**\n  - `output z`: Output signal.\n\n**Port Characteristics:**\n- All input and output ports are single-bit (`1` bit) signals.\n\n**Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:**\n- **State Representation:**\n  - The FSM uses a 3-bit state vector `y[2:0]`, where `y[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `y[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- **Reset Behavior:**\n  - The FSM resets synchronously to the state `000` upon a high signal on the `reset` input.\n\n- **Triggering:**\n  - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n\n- **State Transition Table:**\n\n  | Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State `y[2:0]` if `x=0` | Next State `y[2:0]` if `x=1` | Output `z` |\n  |------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|\n  | 000                    | 000                           | 001                           | 0          |\n  | 001                    | 001                           | 100                           | 0          |\n  | 010                    | 010                           | 001                           | 0          |\n  | 011                    | 001                           | 010                           | 1          |\n  | 100                    | 011                           | 100                           | 1          |\n\n**Output Logic:**\n- The output `z` is determined by the current state as per the state transition table. It does not depend directly on `x`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Upon reset, the FSM enters state `000` regardless of the state prior to the reset.\n- If `clk` and `reset` are asserted simultaneously, the reset takes precedence, ensuring the FSM transitions to state `000`.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- Upon initialization and after a reset, the state of the FSM will be `000`, and output `z` will be `0`.\n\n**Operational Notes:**\n- Ensure that all state transitions and the output logic are implemented according to the above state transition table to maintain the correct behavior of the FSM.\n                    "
