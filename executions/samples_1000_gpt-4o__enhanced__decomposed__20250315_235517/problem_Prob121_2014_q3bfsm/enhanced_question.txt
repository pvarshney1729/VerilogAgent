<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The goal is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a specific interface and behavior. The module features a finite-state machine (FSM) with defined state transitions and output logic. Below are the refined specifications:

**Module Interface:**
- **Inputs:**
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input reset`: Synchronous reset signal, active high.
  - `input x`: Control input signal.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output z`: Output signal.

**Port Characteristics:**
- All input and output ports are single-bit (`1` bit) signals.

**Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:**
- **State Representation:**
  - The FSM uses a 3-bit state vector `y[2:0]`, where `y[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `y[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- **Reset Behavior:**
  - The FSM resets synchronously to the state `000` upon a high signal on the `reset` input.

- **Triggering:**
  - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

- **State Transition Table:**

  | Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State `y[2:0]` if `x=0` | Next State `y[2:0]` if `x=1` | Output `z` |
  |------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
  | 000                    | 000                           | 001                           | 0          |
  | 001                    | 001                           | 100                           | 0          |
  | 010                    | 010                           | 001                           | 0          |
  | 011                    | 001                           | 010                           | 1          |
  | 100                    | 011                           | 100                           | 1          |

**Output Logic:**
- The output `z` is determined by the current state as per the state transition table. It does not depend directly on `x`.

**Edge Cases:**
- Upon reset, the FSM enters state `000` regardless of the state prior to the reset.
- If `clk` and `reset` are asserted simultaneously, the reset takes precedence, ensuring the FSM transitions to state `000`.

**Initial Conditions:**
- Upon initialization and after a reset, the state of the FSM will be `000`, and output `z` will be `0`.

**Operational Notes:**
- Ensure that all state transitions and the output logic are implemented according to the above state transition table to maintain the correct behavior of the FSM.
