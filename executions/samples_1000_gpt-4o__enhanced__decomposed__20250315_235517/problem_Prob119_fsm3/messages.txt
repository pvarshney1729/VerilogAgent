        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1 bit, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, 1 bit, active high.\n  - `in`: State machine input, 1 bit.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: State machine output, 1 bit.\n\nOperational Details:\n1. State Encoding:\n   - The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.\n   - State encoding can be binary, with A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10, D = 2'b11.\n\n2. State Transition Table:\n   - Current State: A\n     - Next State: A if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 0\n   - Current State: B\n     - Next State: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 0\n   - Current State: C\n     - Next State: A if `in` = 0, D if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 0\n   - Current State: D\n     - Next State: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 1\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n   - The asynchronous reset (`areset`) is active high and resets the FSM to state A. It is triggered on the positive edge of `areset`.\n   - On reset, all sequential elements should initialize to their respective values for state A.\n\n4. Clocking:\n   - All sequential logic, including state transitions, should be triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n\n5. Output Logic:\n   - The output `out` is determined solely by the current state of the FSM, as per Moore machine operation.\n   - Ensure that the output reflects the defined state output immediately upon entering a state.\n\n6. Bit Indexing:\n   - State encoding and any related operations should assume bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Cases and Additional Notes:\n- Ensure that operations are well-defined for all possible input sequences.\n- Consider any potential race conditions and ensure proper synchronization with the clock and reset signals.\n                    "
