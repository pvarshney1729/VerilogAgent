Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1 bit, positive edge-triggered.
  - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, 1 bit, active high.
  - `in`: State machine input, 1 bit.
- Output Ports:
  - `out`: State machine output, 1 bit.

Operational Details:
1. State Encoding:
   - The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.
   - State encoding can be binary, with A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10, D = 2'b11.

2. State Transition Table:
   - Current State: A
     - Next State: A if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1
     - Output: 0
   - Current State: B
     - Next State: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1
     - Output: 0
   - Current State: C
     - Next State: A if `in` = 0, D if `in` = 1
     - Output: 0
   - Current State: D
     - Next State: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1
     - Output: 1

3. Reset Behavior:
   - The asynchronous reset (`areset`) is active high and resets the FSM to state A. It is triggered on the positive edge of `areset`.
   - On reset, all sequential elements should initialize to their respective values for state A.

4. Clocking:
   - All sequential logic, including state transitions, should be triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

5. Output Logic:
   - The output `out` is determined solely by the current state of the FSM, as per Moore machine operation.
   - Ensure that the output reflects the defined state output immediately upon entering a state.

6. Bit Indexing:
   - State encoding and any related operations should assume bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Edge Cases and Additional Notes:
- Ensure that operations are well-defined for all possible input sequences.
- Consider any potential race conditions and ensure proper synchronization with the clock and reset signals.
