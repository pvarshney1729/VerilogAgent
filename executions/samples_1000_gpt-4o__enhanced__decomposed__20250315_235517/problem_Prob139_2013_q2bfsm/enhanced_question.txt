Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal triggering all sequential logic on the positive edge.
- input wire resetn: Synchronous, active-low reset signal. When resetn is low (0), the FSM resets to state A.
- input wire x: Motor input signal, monitored for specific sequence.
- input wire y: Motor input signal, monitored after a specific sequence of x.
- output reg f: Control output for the motor, initially 0. Set to 1 for one clock cycle after reset is de-asserted.
- output reg g: Control output for the motor, initially 0. Set based on the state transition conditions.

FSM Description:
1. Initial State (State A):
   - Upon power-up or reset (resetn = 0), the FSM resides in State A.
   - While in State A with resetn = 0, the FSM remains in this state regardless of other inputs.

2. Transition from State A:
   - When resetn is de-asserted (resetn transitions from 0 to 1), on the next positive clock edge:
     - The FSM transitions from State A to State B.
     - Output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle, then reset to 0.

3. State B (Monitor x sequence):
   - The FSM monitors the input x for a specific sequence: 1, 0, 1 across three successive clock cycles.
   - If the sequence is detected, transition to State C on the next clock edge, otherwise remain in State B.

4. State C (Set g and monitor y):
   - Output g is set to 1 upon entering State C.
   - The FSM monitors the input y for a value of 1 within two clock cycles:
     - If y is 1 within the first or second clock cycle, g remains 1 permanently (until reset).
     - If y remains 0 for two consecutive clock cycles, set g to 0 permanently (until reset).

Miscellaneous:
- All operations and transitions are triggered by the positive edge of the clk.
- All registers (f, g) and FSM states must have defined initial values to avoid undefined behavior on startup.

Edge Cases:
- On reset, the FSM immediately returns to State A, and outputs f and g are reset to 0.
- Ensure that transitions between states do not create race conditions by strictly adhering to the clock edge-triggered design.
- Carefully handle input boundaries to prevent metastability or erroneous state transitions.
