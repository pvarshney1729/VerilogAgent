To implement the FSM as specified, we need to define a state machine with several states to handle the sequence detection and output control. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **STATE_A**: Initial state where the FSM remains as long as `resetn` is asserted (low). When `resetn` is de-asserted (high), the FSM transitions to `STATE_B` and sets `f` to 1 for one clock cycle.

2. **STATE_B**: This state is used to detect the sequence `1, 0, 1` on input `x`. It transitions to `STATE_C` after detecting the sequence.

3. **STATE_C**: In this state, `g` is set to 1. The FSM monitors `y` for two clock cycles. If `y` becomes 1 within these two cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1, `g` is set to 0 permanently.

The FSM transitions are controlled by the clock, and all operations are synchronous with respect to the positive edge of the clock. The reset is synchronous and active low, meaning it is sampled on the clock edge.

The implementation will use `logic` for all signals and follow the coding conventions provided, such as using `always @(*)` for combinational logic and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.
