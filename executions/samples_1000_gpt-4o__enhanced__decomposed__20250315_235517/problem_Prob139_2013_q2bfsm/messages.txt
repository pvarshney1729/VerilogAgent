        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal triggering all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n- input wire resetn: Synchronous, active-low reset signal. When resetn is low (0), the FSM resets to state A.\n- input wire x: Motor input signal, monitored for specific sequence.\n- input wire y: Motor input signal, monitored after a specific sequence of x.\n- output reg f: Control output for the motor, initially 0. Set to 1 for one clock cycle after reset is de-asserted.\n- output reg g: Control output for the motor, initially 0. Set based on the state transition conditions.\n\nFSM Description:\n1. Initial State (State A):\n   - Upon power-up or reset (resetn = 0), the FSM resides in State A.\n   - While in State A with resetn = 0, the FSM remains in this state regardless of other inputs.\n\n2. Transition from State A:\n   - When resetn is de-asserted (resetn transitions from 0 to 1), on the next positive clock edge:\n     - The FSM transitions from State A to State B.\n     - Output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle, then reset to 0.\n\n3. State B (Monitor x sequence):\n   - The FSM monitors the input x for a specific sequence: 1, 0, 1 across three successive clock cycles.\n   - If the sequence is detected, transition to State C on the next clock edge, otherwise remain in State B.\n\n4. State C (Set g and monitor y):\n   - Output g is set to 1 upon entering State C.\n   - The FSM monitors the input y for a value of 1 within two clock cycles:\n     - If y is 1 within the first or second clock cycle, g remains 1 permanently (until reset).\n     - If y remains 0 for two consecutive clock cycles, set g to 0 permanently (until reset).\n\nMiscellaneous:\n- All operations and transitions are triggered by the positive edge of the clk.\n- All registers (f, g) and FSM states must have defined initial values to avoid undefined behavior on startup.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- On reset, the FSM immediately returns to State A, and outputs f and g are reset to 0.\n- Ensure that transitions between states do not create race conditions by strictly adhering to the clock edge-triggered design.\n- Carefully handle input boundaries to prevent metastability or erroneous state transitions.\n                    "
