Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal for triggering sequential logic (positive edge-triggered).\n  - `input reset`: Synchronous, active-high reset signal. Resets the FSM and all internal states as though the previous input were 0.\n  - `input in`: Serial input data stream. \n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output disc`: Asserted (logic high) when a zero should be discarded following five consecutive ones.\n  - `output flag`: Asserted (logic high) when a valid frame boundary is detected (6 consecutive ones).\n  - `output err`: Asserted (logic high) when an error is detected (7 or more consecutive ones).\n\nBit Conventions:\n- All signals are 1-bit wide. \n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are scalar (1-bit).\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- Type: Moore-type FSM where outputs depend only on the current state.\n- Initial State: On reset, the FSM initializes to a state that behaves as if the last input was 0.\n- States and Transitions:\n  - Detect sequences of ones to determine when to assert `disc`, `flag`, or `err`.\n  - Sequence to recognize:\n    1. \"0111110\" triggers `disc`.\n    2. \"01111110\" triggers `flag`.\n    3. \"01111111...\" (7 or more ones) triggers `err`.\n\nBehavior and Timing:\n- The output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted during the entire clock cycle immediately following the detection of the respective condition.\n- All state transitions and output assertions are synchronized to the positive edge of the `clk`.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Proper handling of overlapping patterns within the input stream.\n- Ensure no race conditions by asserting outputs one clock cycle after detection.\n- The FSM should return to a state consistent with having just processed an input of 0 upon reset.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On the assertion of `reset`, the FSM returns to its initial state, and all outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are de-asserted (logic low).\n- The reset operation is synchronous, aligning with the positive clock edge.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n- Ensure that any inadvertent sequence of inputs leading to 7 or more consecutive ones results in the `err` signal being asserted.\n- The design must account for back-to-back frames and handle potential input noise or glitches effectively.\n                    "

Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a\n\"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from\naccidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5\nconsecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need\nto signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a\nMoore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\nWhen the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the\nprevious input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The\noutput signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the\nclock cycle after the condition occurs. Assume all sequential\nlogic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n"
