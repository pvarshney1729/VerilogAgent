Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal for sequential logic.\n  - `input wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n  - `input wire in` : Single-bit input to the state machine.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg out` : Single-bit output of the state machine.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- This is a Moore state machine with two states: A and B.\n- State A is represented by a binary value `0`.\n- State B is represented by a binary value `1`.\n- The reset state is State B.\n\nState Transition Table:\n- State B (out=1):\n  - Transition to State A when `in=0`.\n  - Remain in State B when `in=1`.\n- State A (out=0):\n  - Transition to State B when `in=0`.\n  - Remain in State A when `in=1`.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, meaning it affects the state during the clock edge.\n- Upon reset, the state machine transitions to State B.\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- In State B, the output `out` is `1`.\n- In State A, the output `out` is `0`.\n\nTiming and Clocking:\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- Ensure that the `reset` signal is sampled on the rising edge of `clk` to perform the reset action.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On power-up, the state machine should initialize to State B to ensure a known startup condition.\n\nBit Indexing Conventions:\n- Since all inputs and outputs are single-bit, no specific bit indexing is applicable.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Ensure that any glitches or transitions on the `in` signal are synchronized to the `clk` to avoid metastability. Consider using a debouncing mechanism if necessary for noisy inputs.\n                    "
