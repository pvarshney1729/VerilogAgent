To implement the requested Moore state machine, we need to follow the given specifications and guidelines closely. The state machine has two states, A and B, with a synchronous reset that initializes the state to B. The output depends solely on the current state, not the input, which is characteristic of a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a single bit to represent the two states. Let's assign `0` to State A and `1` to State B.

2. **State Transition Logic**: 
   - From State B, if `in` is `0`, transition to State A; if `in` is `1`, remain in State B.
   - From State A, if `in` is `0`, transition to State B; if `in` is `1`, remain in State A.

3. **Output Logic**: 
   - In State B, the output `out` is `1`.
   - In State A, the output `out` is `0`.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is active-high and synchronous, meaning it will be checked on the rising edge of the clock. When reset is high, the state should be set to B.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensure that all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure that the implementation is correct and adheres to the provided guidelines and conventions.
