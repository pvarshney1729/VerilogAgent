Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal for sequential logic.
  - `input wire reset` : Active-high synchronous reset signal.
  - `input wire in` : Single-bit input to the state machine.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg out` : Single-bit output of the state machine.

State Machine Description:
- This is a Moore state machine with two states: A and B.
- State A is represented by a binary value `0`.
- State B is represented by a binary value `1`.
- The reset state is State B.

State Transition Table:
- State B (out=1):
  - Transition to State A when `in=0`.
  - Remain in State B when `in=1`.
- State A (out=0):
  - Transition to State B when `in=0`.
  - Remain in State A when `in=1`.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, meaning it affects the state during the clock edge.
- Upon reset, the state machine transitions to State B.

Output Behavior:
- In State B, the output `out` is `1`.
- In State A, the output `out` is `0`.

Timing and Clocking:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- Ensure that the `reset` signal is sampled on the rising edge of `clk` to perform the reset action.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up, the state machine should initialize to State B to ensure a known startup condition.

Bit Indexing Conventions:
- Since all inputs and outputs are single-bit, no specific bit indexing is applicable.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure that any glitches or transitions on the `in` signal are synchronized to the `clk` to avoid metastability. Consider using a debouncing mechanism if necessary for noisy inputs.
