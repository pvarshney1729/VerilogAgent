Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1-bit, Synchronous active high reset.
  - in: 1-bit input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output signal.

State Machine Specification:
- Type: Moore state machine.
- Number of States: 4 (States are labeled A, B, C, D).
- State Encoding: Binary representation for states is assumed; specific encoding (e.g., 2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11) should be defined in the implementation.
- Initial State: State A upon reset.
- Reset Behavior: Synchronous active high reset that sets the FSM to state A.

Clocking:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).

State Transition Table:
- Current State: A
  - Next State on in=0: A
  - Next State on in=1: B
  - Output: 0
- Current State: B
  - Next State on in=0: C
  - Next State on in=1: B
  - Output: 0
- Current State: C
  - Next State on in=0: A
  - Next State on in=1: D
  - Output: 0
- Current State: D
  - Next State on in=0: C
  - Next State on in=1: B
  - Output: 1

Signal Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Behavioral Notes:
- Ensure there are no race conditions by maintaining a clear separation between combinational logic (state transition logic) and sequential logic (state register updates).
- All state transitions and output determinations are based on the current state and the value of the input signal 'in' at the rising edge of the clock.
- The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state, not by the input 'in', in accordance with the Moore machine model.

Edge Cases:
- At reset (reset=1), the FSM transitions to state A regardless of the current state or input signal.
- The output 'out' should default to 0 upon entering State A and update only at the clock edge following state transitions as specified.
