        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input clock signal. All sequential logic triggers on the positive edge of this clock signal.\n  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset. This reset will initialize all state registers to their default values on the next positive clock edge.\n  - in: 1-bit input signal representing the serial data stream.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - done: 1-bit output signal. This signal is asserted high when a byte has been correctly received.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol consisting of one start bit (logic 0), 8 data bits (transmitted least significant bit first), and one stop bit (logic 1). The line remains at logic 1 during idle periods.\n\nFSM Operation:\n- The FSM identifies the start bit, sequentially processes 8 data bits, and verifies the presence of a stop bit.\n- If the FSM detects an incorrect stop bit, it will wait until a new stop bit is detected before attempting to receive the next byte.\n\nSignal Conventions and Behavior:\n- Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n- Edge Cases: If the start bit is not detected (i.e., the line remains at logic 1), the FSM remains idle without processing any data.\n- Upon detection of the correct stop bit following the 8 data bits, the 'done' signal is asserted high for one clock cycle.\n\nInitial State:\n- On assertion of the synchronous reset during a positive clock edge, all FSM state registers are initialized to their default idle state with 'done' set to logic 0.\n\nEdge Conditions:\n- If 'reset' is asserted, the FSM will return to its idle state and 'done' will be deasserted regardless of the current state.\n- All operations are synchronized with the positive edge of 'clk'.\n\nBehavior Summary:\n- Idle: Waits for the start bit.\n- Start Bit Detected: Transitions to data processing state.\n- Data Bits Processing: Sequentially reads and stores 8 bits.\n- Stop Bit Verification: Checks for the correct stop bit and asserts 'done' if valid.\n- Error Handling: Waits for a valid stop bit if an error is detected, then resets to idle to start a new byte reception cycle.\n                    "
