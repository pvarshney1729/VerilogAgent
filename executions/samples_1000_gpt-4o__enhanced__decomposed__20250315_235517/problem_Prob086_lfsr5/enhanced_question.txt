Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input:
  - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit). All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal (1 bit). When high, resets the LFSR to its initial state.
- Output:
  - `q`: Output of the LFSR (5 bits, indexed from q[4] as the most significant bit to q[0] as the least significant bit).

Specifications:
1. The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
2. The LFSR shifts right each clock cycle.
3. The taps for this LFSR are at bit positions 5 and 3, which correspond to `q[4]` and `q[2]` respectively.
4. The next state for bit `q[4]` is computed as the XOR of the current `q[0]` (least significant bit) with `q[4]` and `q[2]`.
5. Bit positions without taps (`q[3]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`) shift right unchanged.
6. The active-high synchronous reset initializes the LFSR output `q` to the binary value `00001` (i.e., q[4]=0, q[3]=0, q[2]=0, q[1]=0, q[0]=1).
7. The LFSR will cycle through all non-zero states, which are 2^n - 1 states for a 5-bit register (31 states).

Edge Cases:
- The all-zero state must never be reached or generated as part of the LFSR operation.
- On reset, the LFSR is guaranteed to start from the state `00001`.

Timing:
- All operations are synchronized with the positive edge of `clk`.
