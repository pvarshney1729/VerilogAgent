        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit), positive-edge triggered.\n  - `in`: Serial data input (1 bit).\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal (1 bit).\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `out_byte`: 8-bit data output representing the received byte. Valid when `done` is high.\n  - `done`: Output signal (1 bit) indicating that a byte has been successfully received.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol consisting of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The protocol is as follows:\n- **Start Bit**: Logic 0.\n- **Data Bits**: 8 bits transmitted, least significant bit (LSB) first.\n- **Stop Bit**: Logic 1.\n\nFSM Operation:\n1. **Idle State**: The receiver is in this state when no data is being transmitted (line is high).\n2. **Start Bit Detection**: Transition from Idle to Start Bit state on detecting a logic 0 on `in`.\n3. **Data Bit Reception**: After detecting the start bit, the FSM receives 8 data bits. These bits are shifted into `out_byte`, with `in` being the least significant bit (bit[0]).\n4. **Stop Bit Verification**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a logic 1 stop bit.\n5. **Data Validity**: If the stop bit is correct, `done` is asserted high, and `out_byte` holds the valid data byte.\n6. **Error Handling**: If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM waits for a logic 1 to resume data reception.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If a start bit is detected while the FSM is expecting a stop bit, the FSM will reset to the Idle state.\n- During reset (`reset` high), all internal states and `out_byte` should be reset to initial values. `done` should be low.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Data bits are indexed from bit[0] (least significant bit) to bit[7] (most significant bit).\n\nClock and Reset:\n- All operations are synchronized to the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The `reset` signal is synchronous and should reset the FSM to the Idle state, clear `out_byte`, and set `done` low when asserted.\n\nThe specification ensures robust handling of serial data reception with error detection for improper stop bits, ensuring the FSM only transitions to a valid state on correct conditions.\n                    "
