Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit), positive-edge triggered.
  - `in`: Serial data input (1 bit).
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal (1 bit).

- Outputs:
  - `out_byte`: 8-bit data output representing the received byte. Valid when `done` is high.
  - `done`: Output signal (1 bit) indicating that a byte has been successfully received.

Functional Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol consisting of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The protocol is as follows:
- **Start Bit**: Logic 0.
- **Data Bits**: 8 bits transmitted, least significant bit (LSB) first.
- **Stop Bit**: Logic 1.

FSM Operation:
1. **Idle State**: The receiver is in this state when no data is being transmitted (line is high).
2. **Start Bit Detection**: Transition from Idle to Start Bit state on detecting a logic 0 on `in`.
3. **Data Bit Reception**: After detecting the start bit, the FSM receives 8 data bits. These bits are shifted into `out_byte`, with `in` being the least significant bit (bit[0]).
4. **Stop Bit Verification**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a logic 1 stop bit.
5. **Data Validity**: If the stop bit is correct, `done` is asserted high, and `out_byte` holds the valid data byte.
6. **Error Handling**: If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM waits for a logic 1 to resume data reception.

Edge Cases:
- If a start bit is detected while the FSM is expecting a stop bit, the FSM will reset to the Idle state.
- During reset (`reset` high), all internal states and `out_byte` should be reset to initial values. `done` should be low.

Bit Indexing:
- Data bits are indexed from bit[0] (least significant bit) to bit[7] (most significant bit).

Clock and Reset:
- All operations are synchronized to the rising edge of `clk`.
- The `reset` signal is synchronous and should reset the FSM to the Idle state, clear `out_byte`, and set `done` low when asserted.

The specification ensures robust handling of serial data reception with error detection for improper stop bits, ensuring the FSM only transitions to a valid state on correct conditions.
