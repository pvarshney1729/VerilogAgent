<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that can handle the serial communication protocol described. The FSM will have the following states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP, and DONE. The module will detect the start bit, collect 8 data bits, verify the stop bit, and then output the received byte. The `done` signal will be asserted when a byte is successfully received.

1. **IDLE State**: The FSM waits for the start bit (logic 0). If detected, it transitions to the START state.
2. **START State**: This state is a transitional state to ensure the start bit was detected. It immediately transitions to the DATA state.
3. **DATA State**: The FSM collects 8 data bits, shifting them into a register. The least significant bit is received first.
4. **STOP State**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for the stop bit (logic 1). If correct, it transitions to the DONE state; otherwise, it waits for a stop bit.
5. **DONE State**: The FSM asserts the `done` signal and outputs the received byte. It then transitions back to the IDLE state.

The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize all states and outputs. The `out_byte` is only valid when `done` is high, and it is a don't-care otherwise.
