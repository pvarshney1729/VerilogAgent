        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, has the following interface:\n\n- `input clk`: A clock signal that triggers all sequential logic on its rising edge.\n- `input reset`: An active-high, synchronous reset signal. When asserted, it initializes all state registers to their reset state at the next rising edge of `clk`.\n- `input data`: A 1-bit input representing the incoming bit stream to be analyzed.\n- `output reg start_shifting`: A 1-bit output signal that indicates when the sequence 1101 is detected. It remains high after detection until reset.\n\nFunctional Description:\n\n- The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to search for the binary sequence `1101` within the input bit stream (`data`).\n- The FSM transitions through states as bits are received on each `clk` rising edge. The states should be defined to track the sequence progress: initial state, after detecting '1', '11', '110', and finally '1101'.\n- Once the complete sequence `1101` is detected, the output `start_shifting` should be set to `1` and remain at `1` until a reset occurs.\n- The reset initializes the FSM to its initial state and sets `start_shifting` to `0`.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- Bit indexing for multi-bit signals, if any were to be used, would consider `bit[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Define state encoding, whether binary, one-hot, etc., for the FSM in the implementation stage.\n- Ensure all sequential elements, such as state registers, have well-defined initial values upon reset activation.\n- Handle edge cases where the sequence may overlap, such as `1101101`, by ensuring the FSM can correctly re-detect the sequence.\n                    "
