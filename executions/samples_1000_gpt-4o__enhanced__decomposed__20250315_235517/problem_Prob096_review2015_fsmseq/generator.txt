<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in a serial bit stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. `IDLE`: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
2. `S1`: Detected the first '1'.
3. `S11`: Detected '11'.
4. `S110`: Detected '110'.
5. `S1101`: Detected '1101', sequence complete.

The FSM transitions through these states based on the input `data`. Once the sequence `1101` is detected, the output `start_shifting` is set to `1` and remains `1` until a reset occurs. The reset is synchronous, meaning it will only affect the state and output on the rising edge of `clk`.

The implementation will use an `always_ff` block for the state transitions and an `always_comb` block for the next state logic. The `start_shifting` output will be driven by a register that is set when the FSM reaches the `S1101` state.

We will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset logic is synchronous.
