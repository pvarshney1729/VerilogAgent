<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, has the following interface:

- `input clk`: A clock signal that triggers all sequential logic on its rising edge.
- `input reset`: An active-high, synchronous reset signal. When asserted, it initializes all state registers to their reset state at the next rising edge of `clk`.
- `input data`: A 1-bit input representing the incoming bit stream to be analyzed.
- `output reg start_shifting`: A 1-bit output signal that indicates when the sequence 1101 is detected. It remains high after detection until reset.

Functional Description:

- The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to search for the binary sequence `1101` within the input bit stream (`data`).
- The FSM transitions through states as bits are received on each `clk` rising edge. The states should be defined to track the sequence progress: initial state, after detecting '1', '11', '110', and finally '1101'.
- Once the complete sequence `1101` is detected, the output `start_shifting` should be set to `1` and remain at `1` until a reset occurs.
- The reset initializes the FSM to its initial state and sets `start_shifting` to `0`.

Additional Notes:

- Bit indexing for multi-bit signals, if any were to be used, would consider `bit[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).
- Define state encoding, whether binary, one-hot, etc., for the FSM in the implementation stage.
- Ensure all sequential elements, such as state registers, have well-defined initial values upon reset activation.
- Handle edge cases where the sequence may overlap, such as `1101101`, by ensuring the FSM can correctly re-detect the sequence.
