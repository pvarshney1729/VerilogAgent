Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input.
  - in: 8-bit data input stream, where bit[0] represents the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - done: 1-bit output, signals completion of a 3-byte message reception.

Behavioral Specification:
1. The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify message boundaries in an incoming byte stream based on the PS/2 mouse protocol.
2. A message is defined as a sequence of three bytes, where the first byte has in[3] set to '1'. The other two bytes can have in[3] as either '0' or '1'.
3. The FSM will:
   - Continuously monitor the input stream, discarding bytes until it detects a byte with in[3] = '1'.
   - Upon detection, treat this byte as the start of a message.
   - Continue to receive the next two bytes to complete the message.
   - Signal the 'done' output high for one clock cycle in the cycle immediately following the successful reception of the third byte.

Reset and Initial Conditions:
- The system reset is active-high and synchronous, occurring on the positive edge of the clock.
- Upon reset activation, all state elements within the FSM should return to their initial states. The 'done' signal should be set to '0'.

Clock and Timing:
- All sequential logic is synchronized with the rising edge (positive edge) of the clock signal.
- Ensure that any transitions between states and the signaling of 'done' occur in the correct clock cycle to prevent race conditions.

Edge Cases:
- If the input stream is interrupted or malformed, the FSM should reset its detection process and wait for the next valid first byte with in[3] = '1'.
- Handle continuous streams by maintaining FSM state until a valid message boundary is detected.

This specification ensures accuracy and clarity for the implementation of the TopModule, adhering to the functional requirements without ambiguity.
