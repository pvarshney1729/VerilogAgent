Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.\n  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input.\n  - in: 8-bit data input stream, where bit[0] represents the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - done: 1-bit output, signals completion of a 3-byte message reception.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n1. The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify message boundaries in an incoming byte stream based on the PS/2 mouse protocol.\n2. A message is defined as a sequence of three bytes, where the first byte has in[3] set to '1'. The other two bytes can have in[3] as either '0' or '1'.\n3. The FSM will:\n   - Continuously monitor the input stream, discarding bytes until it detects a byte with in[3] = '1'.\n   - Upon detection, treat this byte as the start of a message.\n   - Continue to receive the next two bytes to complete the message.\n   - Signal the 'done' output high for one clock cycle in the cycle immediately following the successful reception of the third byte.\n\nReset and Initial Conditions:\n- The system reset is active-high and synchronous, occurring on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Upon reset activation, all state elements within the FSM should return to their initial states. The 'done' signal should be set to '0'.\n\nClock and Timing:\n- All sequential logic is synchronized with the rising edge (positive edge) of the clock signal.\n- Ensure that any transitions between states and the signaling of 'done' occur in the correct clock cycle to prevent race conditions.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the input stream is interrupted or malformed, the FSM should reset its detection process and wait for the next valid first byte with in[3] = '1'.\n- Handle continuous streams by maintaining FSM state until a valid message boundary is detected.\n\nThis specification ensures accuracy and clarity for the implementation of the TopModule, adhering to the functional requirements without ambiguity.\n                    "
