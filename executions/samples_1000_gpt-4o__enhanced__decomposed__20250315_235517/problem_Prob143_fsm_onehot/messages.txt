Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\n**Interface Specifications:**\n- `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.\n- `input wire [9:0] state`: 10-bit input vector, one-hot encoded, representing the current state. Each bit corresponds to a state (e.g., `state[0]` for S0, `state[9]` for S9).\n- `output reg [9:0] next_state`: 10-bit output vector, one-hot encoded, representing the next state after a transition. Each bit corresponds to the next state (e.g., `next_state[0]` for S0, `next_state[9]` for S9).\n- `output reg out1`: Single-bit output signal.\n- `output reg out2`: Single-bit output signal.\n\n**State Machine Description:**\n- The state machine operates using one-hot encoding.\n- States S0 through S9 are represented by `state[0]` through `state[9]`.\n- The state transitions are dependent on the input signal `in` as follows:\n  - S0: `in == 0` stays in S0, `in == 1` transitions to S1.\n  - S1: `in == 0` transitions to S0, `in == 1` transitions to S2.\n  - S2: `in == 0` transitions to S0, `in == 1` transitions to S3.\n  - S3: `in == 0` transitions to S0, `in == 1` transitions to S4.\n  - S4: `in == 0` transitions to S0, `in == 1` transitions to S5.\n  - S5: `in == 0` transitions to S8, `in == 1` transitions to S6.\n  - S6: `in == 0` transitions to S9, `in == 1` transitions to S7.\n  - S7: `in == 0` transitions to S0, `in == 1` stays in S7.\n  - S8: `in == 0` transitions to S0, `in == 1` transitions to S1.\n  - S9: `in == 0` transitions to S0, `in == 1` transitions to S1.\n\n**Output Logic:**\n- Default output values are `out1 = 0` and `out2 = 0` unless specified otherwise.\n- The outputs are set based on the current state:\n  - S7: `out2 = 1`.\n  - S8: `out1 = 1`.\n  - S9: `out1 = 1`, `out2 = 1`.\n\n**General Operation:**\n- The module is combinational and does not include state-holding elements (flip-flops or registers) for states.\n- The next state and outputs should be determined based on the current state and input `in`.\n- Ensure that only one bit in `next_state` is high at any time, corresponding to the transition logic.\n- Handle potential simultaneous high bits in `state[9:0]` by prioritizing transitions for each active state independently, and ensure correctness in encoding.\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n- If multiple states are active simultaneously due to input `state[9:0]`, prioritize state transitions independently for each active state and set `next_state` accordingly.\n- Ensure no race conditions exist by clearly defining the precedence of operations in the state transition logic.\n                    "
