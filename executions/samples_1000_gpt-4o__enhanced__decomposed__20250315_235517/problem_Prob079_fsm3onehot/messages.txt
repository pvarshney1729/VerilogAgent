Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input wire in;` // Single-bit input signal\n- `input wire [3:0] state;` // 4-bit input representing the current state using one-hot encoding\n- `output reg [3:0] next_state;` // 4-bit output for the next state, using one-hot encoding\n- `output reg out;` // Single-bit output signal\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with one input (`in`), one output (`out`), and four states (A, B, C, D).\n- The state machine utilizes a one-hot encoding scheme: \n  - State A is represented as 4'b0001\n  - State B is represented as 4'b0010\n  - State C is represented as 4'b0100\n  - State D is represented as 4'b1000\n\nState Transition Table:\n- Based on the input `in`, the next state transitions are defined as follows:\n  - Current State A: \n    - `in = 0`: Remain in State A (next_state = 4'b0001)\n    - `in = 1`: Transition to State B (next_state = 4'b0010)\n  - Current State B: \n    - `in = 0`: Transition to State C (next_state = 4'b0100)\n    - `in = 1`: Remain in State B (next_state = 4'b0010)\n  - Current State C: \n    - `in = 0`: Transition to State A (next_state = 4'b0001)\n    - `in = 1`: Transition to State D (next_state = 4'b1000)\n  - Current State D: \n    - `in = 0`: Transition to State C (next_state = 4'b0100)\n    - `in = 1`: Transition to State B (next_state = 4'b0010)\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state:\n  - `out = 0` for states A, B, and C\n  - `out = 1` for state D\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- The provided specification covers only the combinational logic for state transitions and output logic. Sequential elements such as flip-flops for state retention are not detailed here.\n- Assume that the state transitions and output logic are updated synchronously with the clock edge, though clock and reset signals are not explicitly specified in this task.\n                    "
