Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input wire in;` // Single-bit input signal
- `input wire [3:0] state;` // 4-bit input representing the current state using one-hot encoding
- `output reg [3:0] next_state;` // 4-bit output for the next state, using one-hot encoding
- `output reg out;` // Single-bit output signal

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with one input (`in`), one output (`out`), and four states (A, B, C, D).
- The state machine utilizes a one-hot encoding scheme: 
  - State A is represented as 4'b0001
  - State B is represented as 4'b0010
  - State C is represented as 4'b0100
  - State D is represented as 4'b1000

State Transition Table:
- Based on the input `in`, the next state transitions are defined as follows:
  - Current State A: 
    - `in = 0`: Remain in State A (next_state = 4'b0001)
    - `in = 1`: Transition to State B (next_state = 4'b0010)
  - Current State B: 
    - `in = 0`: Transition to State C (next_state = 4'b0100)
    - `in = 1`: Remain in State B (next_state = 4'b0010)
  - Current State C: 
    - `in = 0`: Transition to State A (next_state = 4'b0001)
    - `in = 1`: Transition to State D (next_state = 4'b1000)
  - Current State D: 
    - `in = 0`: Transition to State C (next_state = 4'b0100)
    - `in = 1`: Transition to State B (next_state = 4'b0010)

Output Logic:
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state:
  - `out = 0` for states A, B, and C
  - `out = 1` for state D

Additional Considerations:
- The provided specification covers only the combinational logic for state transitions and output logic. Sequential elements such as flip-flops for state retention are not detailed here.
- Assume that the state transitions and output logic are updated synchronously with the clock edge, though clock and reset signals are not explicitly specified in this task.
