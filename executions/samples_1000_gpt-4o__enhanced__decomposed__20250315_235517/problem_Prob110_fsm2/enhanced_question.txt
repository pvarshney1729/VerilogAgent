Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1-bit. This signal is used as the primary clock for state transitions in the sequential logic.
  - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, 1-bit. Active high. This signal resets the state machine to the initial state (OFF) regardless of the clock.
  - `j`: Input signal, 1-bit. Used to determine state transitions from the OFF state.
  - `k`: Input signal, 1-bit. Used to determine state transitions from the ON state.
- Outputs:
  - `out`: Output signal, 1-bit. Represents the current state output of the state machine.

Conventions:
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- Initial State: OFF
- States:
  - OFF: State output `out` is 0.
    - Transition to ON when `j` is 1.
    - Remain in OFF when `j` is 0.
  - ON: State output `out` is 1.
    - Transition to OFF when `k` is 1.
    - Remain in ON when `k` is 0.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is an active-high asynchronous reset, meaning the state machine will transition to the initial state (OFF) immediately when `areset` is asserted, regardless of the clock signal.

Clock and Timing:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- The state machine is sensitive to `j` and `k` inputs only at the rising edge of `clk`, except when `areset` is asserted.

Initial Values:
- Upon power-up and when `areset` is asserted, the state machine initializes to the OFF state with `out` set to 0.

Edge Cases:
- If `areset` is deasserted while `clk` is low, the state transition will not occur until the next rising edge of `clk`.
- Simultaneous assertion of `areset` and rising edge of `clk` will prioritize the reset condition, setting the state to OFF.

Note:
- Ensure there are no race conditions by synchronizing all state transitions to the clock edge.
- State transitions are determined solely by the current state and input conditions as described above.
