<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are based on the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` is determined by the current state. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, meaning it will immediately set the state to OFF when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock. The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock. We will use an enumerated type for the states to improve code readability. The output logic is straightforward since it depends only on the current state.

module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic areset,
    input logic j,

    output logic out
);

    typedef enum logic [0:0] {OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1} state_t;
    state_t state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            state <= OFF;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            OFF: begin
                if (j)
                    next_state = ON;
                else
