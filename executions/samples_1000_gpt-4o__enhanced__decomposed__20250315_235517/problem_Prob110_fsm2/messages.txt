Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1-bit. This signal is used as the primary clock for state transitions in the sequential logic.\n  - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, 1-bit. Active high. This signal resets the state machine to the initial state (OFF) regardless of the clock.\n  - `j`: Input signal, 1-bit. Used to determine state transitions from the OFF state.\n  - `k`: Input signal, 1-bit. Used to determine state transitions from the ON state.\n- Outputs:\n  - `out`: Output signal, 1-bit. Represents the current state output of the state machine.\n\nConventions:\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Type: Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.\n- Initial State: OFF\n- States:\n  - OFF: State output `out` is 0.\n    - Transition to ON when `j` is 1.\n    - Remain in OFF when `j` is 0.\n  - ON: State output `out` is 1.\n    - Transition to OFF when `k` is 1.\n    - Remain in ON when `k` is 0.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is an active-high asynchronous reset, meaning the state machine will transition to the initial state (OFF) immediately when `areset` is asserted, regardless of the clock signal.\n\nClock and Timing:\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The state machine is sensitive to `j` and `k` inputs only at the rising edge of `clk`, except when `areset` is asserted.\n\nInitial Values:\n- Upon power-up and when `areset` is asserted, the state machine initializes to the OFF state with `out` set to 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If `areset` is deasserted while `clk` is low, the state transition will not occur until the next rising edge of `clk`.\n- Simultaneous assertion of `areset` and rising edge of `clk` will prioritize the reset condition, setting the state to OFF.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure there are no race conditions by synchronizing all state transitions to the clock edge.\n- State transitions are determined solely by the current state and input conditions as described above.\n                    "
