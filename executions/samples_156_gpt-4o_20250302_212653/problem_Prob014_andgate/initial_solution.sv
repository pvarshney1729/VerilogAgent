// Module: TopModule
// Description: Implements a 2-input AND gate as combinational logic.
// All ports are explicitly defined as single-bit wide.

module TopModule (
    input logic a,     // Input: single-bit, unsignalled
    input logic b,     // Input: single-bit, unsignalled
    output logic out   // Output: single-bit, unsignalled
);

// Behavioral Description:
// The module performs a bitwise AND operation on inputs 'a' and 'b'.

// Truth Table:
// | a | b | out |
// |---|---|-----|
// | 0 | 0 |  0  |
// | 0 | 1 |  0  |
// | 1 | 0 |  0  |
// | 1 | 1 |  1  |

// Combinational Logic Implementation:
assign out = a & b;  // 'out' is the result of AND operation on 'a' and 'b'.

// Notes:
// - This module is purely combinational; no clock or reset signals are required.
// - Bit-ordering is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.
// - No initial states are relevant to the operation of this module as it is combinational.
// - All possible input combinations are inherently covered by the nature of the AND operation.
