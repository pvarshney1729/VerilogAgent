To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine with the specified behavior, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the State Encoding**: We will use two states, OFF and ON, encoded as 1-bit values. OFF will be represented by `1'b0` and ON by `1'b1`.

2. **Declare Ports and Signals**: We will declare the input and output ports as `logic` types, as well as internal signals for the current and next state.

3. **Implement the State Register**: We will use a sequential `always` block triggered by the rising edge of the clock to update the current state. The reset will be handled synchronously within this block.

4. **Implement the Next State Logic**: We will use a combinational `always @(*)` block to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

5. **Implement the Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. We will use a simple assignment to set the output based on the current state.

6. **Adhere to Coding Conventions**: We will ensure that all ports and signals are declared as `logic`, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and handle the synchronous reset correctly.

By following these steps, we will create a Verilog module that meets the specified requirements and adheres to the provided coding conventions.
