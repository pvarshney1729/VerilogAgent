Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module `TopModule` is a Verilog module with the following interface:\n\n- `input  clk`: A clock signal for the sequential logic of the state machine.\n- `input  reset`: An active-high synchronous reset signal that initializes the state machine to the OFF state.\n- `input  j`: A control input signal for transitioning between states.\n- `input  k`: A control input signal for transitioning between states.\n- `output reg out`: A one-bit output signal representing the current state of the machine.\n\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, not by the inputs.\n\n- OFF state: `out = 0`\n- ON state: `out = 1`\n\nState Transition Rules:\n1. From the OFF state (`out = 0`):\n   - If `j = 0`, remain in the OFF state.\n   - If `j = 1`, transition to the ON state.\n\n2. From the ON state (`out = 1`):\n   - If `k = 0`, remain in the ON state.\n   - If `k = 1`, transition to the OFF state.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous and active-high, meaning the state is set to OFF on the rising edge of the `clk` when `reset` is asserted (i.e., `reset = 1`).\n- Upon reset, the state machine initializes the state to OFF, setting `out` to 0.\n\nClock Cycle and Timing:\n- State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n- Ensure that changes to `j` and `k` are stable and correctly sampled on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n\nInitial State:\n- On power-up or reset, the state machine should initialize to the OFF state, with `out` set to 0.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are one bit.\n- Ensure that `out` is driven as a registered output to reflect the state accurately.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The behavior at the edges of state transitions is fully defined by the provided state transition rules.\n- No undefined or race conditions should occur given the synchronous design.\n                    "
