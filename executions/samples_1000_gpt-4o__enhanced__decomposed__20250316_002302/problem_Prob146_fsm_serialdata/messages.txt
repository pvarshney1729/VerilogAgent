        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module `TopModule` is designed to receive and decode a byte of data transmitted serially with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. It interfaces with the following ports:\n\n- `input wire clk`: The clock signal. It triggers all sequential logic on its positive edge.\n- `input wire in`: The serial data input signal.\n- `input wire reset`: An active-high, synchronous reset signal that initializes the module.\n- `output reg [7:0] out_byte`: An 8-bit output register that holds the correctly received data byte. The value is valid when `done` is asserted.\n- `output reg done`: A 1-bit output signal indicating the successful reception of a complete byte, including start and stop bits.\n\nDesign Specifications:\n1. **Serial Data Format**: Each data byte is framed with a start bit (`0`) and a stop bit (`1`). The line remains at logic `1` when idle. The 8 data bits are transmitted with the least significant bit first.\n\n2. **Finite State Machine (FSM) Design**:\n   - **Idle State**: The FSM waits for a start bit (`0`). It transitions to the next state upon detecting a `0`.\n   - **Data Reception**: After detecting the start bit, the FSM sequentially shifts in 8 data bits (from LSB to MSB) into `out_byte`.\n   - **Stop Bit Verification**: After 8 data bits are received, the FSM checks for the stop bit (`1`).\n   - **Completion and Validity**:\n     - If the stop bit is correct, the FSM sets `done` to `1` and holds `out_byte` valid for one clock cycle.\n     - If the stop bit is incorrect, the FSM waits for the next valid stop bit before attempting to receive a new byte.\n\n3. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - The `reset` signal, when asserted high, synchronously initializes the FSM to the idle state and clears `out_byte` and `done`.\n\n4. **Operational Notes**:\n   - The bit indexing follows `bit[0]` as the least significant bit.\n   - `done` is set to `1` only when a valid byte is received with correct start and stop bits. Otherwise, it remains `0`.\n   - The FSM ensures that `out_byte` holds valid data only when `done` is `1`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The module handles continuous streams of serial data without assuming fixed packet boundaries.\n   - It gracefully handles incorrect stop bits by resetting the byte reception process until a valid stop bit is detected.\n                    "
