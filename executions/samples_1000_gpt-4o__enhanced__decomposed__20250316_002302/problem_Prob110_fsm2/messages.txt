        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` with the following interface. Unless specified otherwise, all input and output ports are single-bit signals.\n\n- `input clk`: Clock input signal, used for synchronizing the state transitions.\n- `input areset`: Asynchronous active-high reset input signal. When asserted, the state machine resets to the OFF state.\n- `input j`: Input signal for controlling state transitions when the state machine is in the OFF state.\n- `input k`: Input signal for controlling state transitions when the state machine is in the ON state.\n- `output reg out`: Output signal representing the current state output. It is 1 bit wide and indicates the state of the machine.\n\nThe `TopModule` implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`, as described below:\n\n- **State OFF** (Output `out = 0`):\n  - If `j = 0`, remain in state OFF.\n  - If `j = 1`, transition to state ON.\n\n- **State ON** (Output `out = 1`):\n  - If `k = 0`, remain in state ON.\n  - If `k = 1`, transition to state OFF.\n\nThe state machine has the following characteristics:\n- Reset behavior: The reset is asynchronous and active high. When `areset` is high, the state machine will immediately transition to and remain in the OFF state, regardless of the clock signal.\n- Initial state: Upon reset, or at power-up, the state machine should be in the OFF state, and `out` should be 0.\n- Clock edge: State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and not by the input signals directly, following the Moore machine model.\n\nAll transitions, including reset, should be effectively debounced or managed to avoid glitches or race conditions.\n                    "

Use a localparam to define these states.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding using localparam\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register to hold the current state of the FSM. Use an always_ff block to update the state on the rising edge of clk or when areset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\ntypedef enum logic [0:0] {OFF, ON} state_t;\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset)\n      current_state <= OFF;\n    else\n      current_state <= next_state;\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the state transition logic using an always_comb block. Define transitions based on the current state and inputs j and k.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\ntypedef enum logic [0:0] {OFF, ON} state_t;\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  always_comb begin\n    case (current_state)\n      OFF: begin\n        if (j)\n          next_state = ON;\n        else\n          next_state = OFF;\n      end\n      ON: begin\n        if (k)\n          next_state = OFF;\n        else\n          next_state = ON;\n      end\n      default: next_state = OFF; // Default case for safety\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output logic for the Moore machine. The output depends only on the current state. Use an always_comb block to assign the output based on the state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [0:0] {\n    OFF = 1'b0,\n    ON  = 1'b1\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t current_state;\n  logic out;\n\n  // Output logic for Moore machine\n  always_comb begin\n    case (current_state)\n      OFF: out = 1'b0;\n      ON:  out = 1'b1;\n      default: out = 1'b0; // Default case for safety\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 6: Verify the implementation against the state transition table to ensure all transitions and outputs are correct.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n```verilog\n[BEGIN]\nreg state, next_state;\n\n// State encoding\nlocalparam OFF = 1'b0;\nlocalparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n// State transition logic\nalways @(*) begin\n    case (state)\n        OFF: begin\n            if (j == 1'b1)\n                next_state = ON;\n            else\n                next_state = OFF;\n        end\n        ON: begin\n            if (k == 1'b1)\n                next_state = OFF;\n            else\n                next_state = ON;\n        end\n        default: next_state = OFF;\n    endcase\nend\n\n// Output logic\nassign out = (state == ON) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n[END]\n```\n                    "
