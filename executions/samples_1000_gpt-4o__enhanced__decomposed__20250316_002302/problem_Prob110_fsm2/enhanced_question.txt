The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` with the following interface. Unless specified otherwise, all input and output ports are single-bit signals.

- `input clk`: Clock input signal, used for synchronizing the state transitions.
- `input areset`: Asynchronous active-high reset input signal. When asserted, the state machine resets to the OFF state.
- `input j`: Input signal for controlling state transitions when the state machine is in the OFF state.
- `input k`: Input signal for controlling state transitions when the state machine is in the ON state.
- `output reg out`: Output signal representing the current state output. It is 1 bit wide and indicates the state of the machine.

The `TopModule` implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`, as described below:

- **State OFF** (Output `out = 0`):
  - If `j = 0`, remain in state OFF.
  - If `j = 1`, transition to state ON.

- **State ON** (Output `out = 1`):
  - If `k = 0`, remain in state ON.
  - If `k = 1`, transition to state OFF.

The state machine has the following characteristics:
- Reset behavior: The reset is asynchronous and active high. When `areset` is high, the state machine will immediately transition to and remain in the OFF state, regardless of the clock signal.
- Initial state: Upon reset, or at power-up, the state machine should be in the OFF state, and `out` should be 0.
- Clock edge: State transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and not by the input signals directly, following the Moore machine model.

All transitions, including reset, should be effectively debounced or managed to avoid glitches or race conditions.
