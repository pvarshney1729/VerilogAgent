<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the States**: We have two states, OFF and ON. We'll use a localparam to define these states for clarity and maintainability.

2. **State Register**: We'll use a sequential always block to update the current state based on the clock and asynchronous reset. The reset will be active-high, meaning when `areset` is high, the state will be set to OFF.

3. **State Transition Logic**: We'll use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.

4. **Output Logic**: Since it's a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state. We'll use a combinational always block to set the output based on the state.

5. **Interface and Signal Declaration**: We'll declare all ports and internal signals as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

6. **Sensitivity Lists**: For combinational logic, we'll use `always @(*)` to ensure all relevant signals are considered.

7. **Numeric Constants**: We'll ensure all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

By following these steps, we ensure the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions provided.
