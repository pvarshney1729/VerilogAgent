Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input clk: Clock signal, triggers all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n- input reset: Synchronous, active-high reset signal, resets the FSM to state 000.\n- input x: Input signal, 1-bit.\n- output reg z: Output signal, 1-bit.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. Finite State Machine (FSM) Details:\n   - The FSM comprises states represented by a 3-bit vector y[2:0], where y[2] is the most significant bit (MSB) and y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n   - State Encoding:\n     * State 000: Initial state, entry point upon reset.\n     * State 001: Intermediate state.\n     * State 010: Intermediate state.\n     * State 011: Intermediate state.\n     * State 100: Intermediate state.\n\n2. Reset Behavior:\n   - The reset signal is synchronous.\n   - When reset is asserted (logic high) during a clock cycle, the FSM transitions immediately to state 000 on the next positive clock edge.\n\n3. State Transition Table:\n   - Present State y[2:0] | Next State y[2:0] for x=0, Next State y[2:0] for x=1 | Output z\n   - 000 | 000, 001 | 0\n   - 001 | 001, 100 | 0\n   - 010 | 010, 001 | 0\n   - 011 | 001, 010 | 1\n   - 100 | 011, 100 | 1\n\n4. Output Logic:\n   - The output z is a function of the current state only (Moore machine).\n   - Output z is set to '1' in states 011 and 100; otherwise, it is '0'.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n   - If the system is powered on and reset is low, behavior is undefined until the first positive clock edge with reset high.\n   - If x changes during a clock cycle, the new value is considered at the next positive clock edge.\n\n6. Initial Conditions:\n   - At power-up or upon reset assertion, all state registers should initialize to state 000.\n   - The output z should initialize to '0' on reset.\n\nEnsure that all logic and state transitions are implemented correctly to satisfy the above specifications.\n                    "
