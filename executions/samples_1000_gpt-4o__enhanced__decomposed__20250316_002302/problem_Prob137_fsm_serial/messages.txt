        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - reset: 1-bit, active-high synchronous reset.\n  - in: 1-bit, serial data input.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - done: 1-bit, indicates successful byte reception.\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process a serial communication protocol characterized by the following bit pattern: 1 start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line remains at logic 1 when idle. The data byte is transmitted with the least significant bit first.\n\nState Machine Design:\n1. Initial/Idle State: The FSM remains in this state when the line is idle (logic 1). Transitions to the \"Start Bit Detected\" state upon detecting a start bit (logic 0).\n\n2. Start Bit Detected: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0). Upon detection, it transitions to the \"Data Reception\" state.\n\n3. Data Reception: This state reads the next 8 bits as data bits, least significant bit first. The FSM transitions to the \"Stop Bit Expected\" state after successfully reading 8 data bits.\n\n4. Stop Bit Expected: The FSM verifies the presence of a stop bit (logic 1). If detected, the \"done\" signal is asserted high for one clock cycle, then returns to the initial/idle state. If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM remains in this state until a stop bit is found.\n\n5. Error Handling: If the expected stop bit is not detected after 8 data bits, the FSM does not transition back to the start but waits for a valid stop bit before restarting the byte reception process.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, initializing the FSM to the Initial/Idle State.\n- All internal registers and states are reset to their initial conditions on the assertion of the reset signal.\n\nClock and Timing:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- Ensure no race conditions by clearly defining the state transitions and signal sampling at the clock edges.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- In scenarios where the start bit is immediately followed by another start bit without a stop bit, the FSM will wait in the \"Stop Bit Expected\" state until a valid stop bit is detected.\n- Ensure correct handling of continuous '1's on the line, maintaining the FSM in the Initial/Idle State unless a valid start sequence is detected.\n\nNote: The bit indexing begins at 0, with bit[0] referring to the least significant bit.\n                    "
