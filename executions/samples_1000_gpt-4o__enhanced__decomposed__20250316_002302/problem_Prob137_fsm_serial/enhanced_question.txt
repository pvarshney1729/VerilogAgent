Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1-bit, active-high synchronous reset.
  - in: 1-bit, serial data input.

- Output Ports:
  - done: 1-bit, indicates successful byte reception.

Description:
The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process a serial communication protocol characterized by the following bit pattern: 1 start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line remains at logic 1 when idle. The data byte is transmitted with the least significant bit first.

State Machine Design:
1. Initial/Idle State: The FSM remains in this state when the line is idle (logic 1). Transitions to the "Start Bit Detected" state upon detecting a start bit (logic 0).

2. Start Bit Detected: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0). Upon detection, it transitions to the "Data Reception" state.

3. Data Reception: This state reads the next 8 bits as data bits, least significant bit first. The FSM transitions to the "Stop Bit Expected" state after successfully reading 8 data bits.

4. Stop Bit Expected: The FSM verifies the presence of a stop bit (logic 1). If detected, the "done" signal is asserted high for one clock cycle, then returns to the initial/idle state. If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM remains in this state until a stop bit is found.

5. Error Handling: If the expected stop bit is not detected after 8 data bits, the FSM does not transition back to the start but waits for a valid stop bit before restarting the byte reception process.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, initializing the FSM to the Initial/Idle State.
- All internal registers and states are reset to their initial conditions on the assertion of the reset signal.

Clock and Timing:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- Ensure no race conditions by clearly defining the state transitions and signal sampling at the clock edges.

Edge Cases:
- In scenarios where the start bit is immediately followed by another start bit without a stop bit, the FSM will wait in the "Stop Bit Expected" state until a valid stop bit is detected.
- Ensure correct handling of continuous '1's on the line, maintaining the FSM in the Initial/Idle State unless a valid start sequence is detected.

Note: The bit indexing begins at 0, with bit[0] referring to the least significant bit.
