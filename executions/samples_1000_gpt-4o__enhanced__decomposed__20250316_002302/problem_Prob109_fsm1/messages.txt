        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, is designed to function as a Moore state machine. The interface consists of the following ports:\n\n- `input clk`: A clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.\n- `input areset`: An asynchronous reset signal that, when high, forces the state machine to transition to its initial state.\n- `input in`: An input signal that influences state transitions.\n- `output reg out`: An output signal representing the current state's output value.\n\n### State Machine Description\n\nThe state machine has two states, named `A` and `B`. The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:\n\n- **State B**: \n  - Output `out` = 1\n  - Transition to state `A` on `in` = 0\n  - Remain in state `B` on `in` = 1\n\n- **State A**: \n  - Output `out` = 0\n  - Transition to state `B` on `in` = 0\n  - Remain in state `A` on `in` = 1\n\n### Reset Behavior\n\n- The state machine enters state `B` upon assertion of the asynchronous reset `areset`. This reset takes immediate effect regardless of the clock signal.\n\n### Signal and State Definitions\n\n- The state machine is implemented using a two-state encoding, where:\n  - State `A` is encoded as binary `0`.\n  - State `B` is encoded as binary `1`.\n  \n- The asynchronous reset signal, `areset`, is active high. When `areset` is high, the state machine transitions to state `B` immediately.\n\n### Bit Indexing and Output\n\n- All input and output ports are single-bit wide.\n- The least significant bit (bit[0]) represents the value of the input signal `in`.\n\n### Initial Conditions\n\n- Upon power-up or reset, the state machine initializes to state `B`, with `out` set to 1.\n\n### Edge Cases and Input Boundaries\n\n- The behavior of the state machine is fully defined for all possible inputs (`in` = 0 or 1) during normal operation.\n- The asynchronous reset (`areset`) overrides all other inputs and immediately resets the state to `B`.\n\nEnsure that the implementation adheres to the above specifications for correctness and reliability in the intended application.\n                    "
