<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, is designed to function as a Moore state machine. The interface consists of the following ports:

- `input clk`: A clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.
- `input areset`: An asynchronous reset signal that, when high, forces the state machine to transition to its initial state.
- `input in`: An input signal that influences state transitions.
- `output reg out`: An output signal representing the current state's output value.

### State Machine Description

The state machine has two states, named `A` and `B`. The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:

- **State B**: 
  - Output `out` = 1
  - Transition to state `A` on `in` = 0
  - Remain in state `B` on `in` = 1

- **State A**: 
  - Output `out` = 0
  - Transition to state `B` on `in` = 0
  - Remain in state `A` on `in` = 1

### Reset Behavior

- The state machine enters state `B` upon assertion of the asynchronous reset `areset`. This reset takes immediate effect regardless of the clock signal.

### Signal and State Definitions

- The state machine is implemented using a two-state encoding, where:
  - State `A` is encoded as binary `0`.
  - State `B` is encoded as binary `1`.
  
- The asynchronous reset signal, `areset`, is active high. When `areset` is high, the state machine transitions to state `B` immediately.

### Bit Indexing and Output

- All input and output ports are single-bit wide.
- The least significant bit (bit[0]) represents the value of the input signal `in`.

### Initial Conditions

- Upon power-up or reset, the state machine initializes to state `B`, with `out` set to 1.

### Edge Cases and Input Boundaries

- The behavior of the state machine is fully defined for all possible inputs (`in` = 0 or 1) during normal operation.
- The asynchronous reset (`areset`) overrides all other inputs and immediately resets the state to `B`.

Ensure that the implementation adheres to the above specifications for correctness and reliability in the intended application.
