Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal. All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n  - `input wire data`: Serial data input for pattern detection and duration specification.\n  - `input wire done_counting`: Signal that indicates the counting process is complete.\n  - `input wire ack`: Acknowledgment signal from the user after the timer completion notification.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg shift_ena`: Enable signal for shifting in additional bits, active for exactly 4 clock cycles.\n  - `output reg counting`: Signal indicating the timer is in the counting state.\n  - `output reg done`: Signal to notify the user that the timer has completed its duration.\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. **Pattern Detection**: The state machine monitors the `data` input for the specific bit sequence `1101`. This is the starting sequence for the timer operation.\n\n2. **Bit Shifting for Duration**:\n   - Upon detecting the `1101` pattern, the state machine asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles to shift in additional bits that determine the counting duration.\n\n3. **Counting State**:\n   - After the 4 bits are shifted in, `shift_ena` is de-asserted, and the state machine asserts `counting` to indicate that it is in the counting phase.\n   - The state machine remains in this state until `done_counting` is asserted high, indicating that the counting process has finished.\n\n4. **Completion Notification**:\n   - Upon completion of counting, the state machine asserts `done` to notify the user.\n   - The state machine waits in this state until `ack` is asserted high by the user, signaling acknowledgment of the timer completion.\n\n5. **Reset and State Initialization**:\n   - The reset is synchronous and active high. When `reset` is high, the state machine transitions to its initial state, ready to detect the next occurrence of the `1101` pattern.\n   - All state transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- Ensure that the state machine handles noise or incomplete sequences by resetting or ignoring intermediate states if the exact pattern `1101` is not detected sequentially.\n- The system should be robust against any input signal glitches by checking the sequence strictly over four consecutive clock cycles.\n\nNote: The data path for counters and comparators is not part of this specification and should be handled separately.\n                    "
