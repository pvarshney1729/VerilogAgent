        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named TopModule, shall have the following interface and behavior specifications. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing the sequential logic. Triggering occurs on the positive edge.\n- `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When high, all state registers are reset to their initial state on the next clock edge.\n- `input data`: Input bit stream to be monitored for the sequence.\n- `output reg start_shifting`: Output signal indicating detection of the sequence. This signal is set to 1 upon sequence detection and remains 1 until reset.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n1. The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the sequence \"1101\" in the `data` input stream.\n2. The FSM is designed with states to track the occurrence of each bit in the sequence \"1101\". The states are defined as follows:\n   - State 0: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.\n   - State 1: First '1' detected.\n   - State 2: Sequence \"11\" detected.\n   - State 3: Sequence \"110\" detected.\n   - State 4: Sequence \"1101\" detected.\n\n3. Transition from one state to another is based on the current state and the `data` input:\n   - State 0 to State 1 on input '1'.\n   - State 1 to State 2 on input '1'.\n   - State 2 to State 3 on input '0'.\n   - State 3 to State 4 on input '1'.\n\n4. When the FSM reaches State 4, `start_shifting` is set to 1 and remains at 1 irrespective of further inputs, until a reset occurs.\n\n5. Upon receiving a synchronous reset (`reset` = 1), the FSM transitions back to State 0 on the next positive clock edge, and `start_shifting` is reset to 0.\n\n6. The reset state for all state registers is the initial state (State 0).\n\n7. `start_shifting` is initialized to 0 at reset.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- If the input stream starts or continues with bits not forming the sequence \"1101\", the FSM will remain in or revert to a previous state as per the sequence detection logic.\n- The FSM is robust to handle any arbitrary length of input stream, continuously scanning for the sequence.\n\nSequence Detection Example:\n- Input Stream: ...1011101...\n  - Transition: State 0 -> State 1 -> State 2 -> State 3 -> State 4\n  - Output: `start_shifting` is set to 1 at the completion of the sequence \"1101\".\n                    "
