        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input, positive-edge triggered.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `q`: 5-bit output representing the state of the LFSR.\n\nDescription:\nThe module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The LFSR's feedback taps are located at bit positions 4 (MSB) and 2. The LFSR shifts right, and the bit at each tapped position is XORed with the least significant bit (LSB) to determine the next state of that bit. Non-tapped positions simply shift the previous bit into the current position.\n\nOperational Details:\n1. **Clock and Reset**:\n   - The LFSR operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - The `reset` signal is synchronous and active-high. On reset, the LFSR state `q` is initialized to `5'b00001`.\n\n2. **Bit Indexing**:\n   - `q[4]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n   - `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n3. **LFSR Feedback Logic**:\n   - On each clock cycle, if `reset` is not asserted, the bits of `q` are updated as follows:\n     - `q[4]` <= `q[3]`.\n     - `q[3]` <= `q[2]`.\n     - `q[2]` <= `q[1] ^ q[0]` (tap at position 3).\n     - `q[1]` <= `q[0]`.\n     - `q[0]` <= `q[4] ^ q[0]` (tap at position 5).\n\n4. **Initial and Edge Case Handling**:\n   - The LFSR is initialized to `5'b00001` upon a reset event.\n   - The LFSR must never enter an all-zero state during normal operation. It cycles through `2^5 - 1 = 31` unique non-zero states.\n\nNote: The chosen tap positions ensure that the LFSR exhibits a maximal-length sequence, covering all possible non-zero states before repeating.\n                    "
