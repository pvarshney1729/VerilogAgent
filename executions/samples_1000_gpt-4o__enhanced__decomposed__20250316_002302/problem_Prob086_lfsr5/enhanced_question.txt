Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input, positive-edge triggered.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input.
- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 5-bit output representing the state of the LFSR.

Description:
The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The LFSR's feedback taps are located at bit positions 4 (MSB) and 2. The LFSR shifts right, and the bit at each tapped position is XORed with the least significant bit (LSB) to determine the next state of that bit. Non-tapped positions simply shift the previous bit into the current position.

Operational Details:
1. **Clock and Reset**:
   - The LFSR operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
   - The `reset` signal is synchronous and active-high. On reset, the LFSR state `q` is initialized to `5'b00001`.

2. **Bit Indexing**:
   - `q[4]` is the most significant bit (MSB).
   - `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

3. **LFSR Feedback Logic**:
   - On each clock cycle, if `reset` is not asserted, the bits of `q` are updated as follows:
     - `q[4]` <= `q[3]`.
     - `q[3]` <= `q[2]`.
     - `q[2]` <= `q[1] ^ q[0]` (tap at position 3).
     - `q[1]` <= `q[0]`.
     - `q[0]` <= `q[4] ^ q[0]` (tap at position 5).

4. **Initial and Edge Case Handling**:
   - The LFSR is initialized to `5'b00001` upon a reset event.
   - The LFSR must never enter an all-zero state during normal operation. It cycles through `2^5 - 1 = 31` unique non-zero states.

Note: The chosen tap positions ensure that the LFSR exhibits a maximal-length sequence, covering all possible non-zero states before repeating.
