To implement the FSM as specified, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Module Interface**: The module will have inputs `clk`, `reset`, `w`, and output `z`.

2. **State Encoding**: We'll use a 3-bit vector to represent the states, assigning binary codes to each state (A, B, C, D, E, F).

3. **State Register**: We'll use an always block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to update the current state. The `reset` signal will be handled synchronously within this block to reset the state to A.

4. **State Transition Logic**: Another always block will be used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `w`.

5. **Output Logic**: We'll use an always block to determine the output `z` based on the current state. The output is `1` for states E and F, and `0` otherwise.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We'll use `logic` for all signals, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

7. **Synthesis-Friendly Design**: We'll include a default case in the state transition logic to ensure the design is synthesis-friendly.

By following these steps, we will ensure the FSM is implemented correctly according to the specification.
