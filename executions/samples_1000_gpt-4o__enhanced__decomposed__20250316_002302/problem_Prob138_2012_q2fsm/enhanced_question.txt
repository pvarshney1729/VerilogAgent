Module Specification for FSM in Verilog:

Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input wire reset: Synchronous, active-high reset signal.
- input wire w: Input signal for state transitions.
- output reg z: Output signal indicating state-dependent output.

State Encoding:
- Use a 3-bit vector to represent states. Assign the following binary codes to each state:
  - State A: 3'b000
  - State B: 3'b001
  - State C: 3'b010
  - State D: 3'b011
  - State E: 3'b100
  - State F: 3'b101

State Transition Table:
- A (000) on w=1 transitions to B (001), on w=0 remains in A (000).
- B (001) on w=1 transitions to C (010), on w=0 transitions to D (011).
- C (010) on w=1 transitions to E (100), on w=0 transitions to D (011).
- D (011) on w=1 transitions to F (101), on w=0 transitions to A (000).
- E (100) on w=1 remains in E (100), on w=0 transitions to D (011).
- F (101) on w=1 transitions to C (010), on w=0 transitions to D (011).

Reset Behavior:
- Reset is synchronous and active-high, setting the FSM to state A (000) on the next positive clock edge.

Output Definition:
- The output signal z is determined by the current state:
  - z = 1 when in states E (100) or F (101).
  - z = 0 in all other states.

Implementation Guidelines:
- Use two always blocks: one for the state transition logic and one for the state register logic.
- State transitions should occur on the positive edge of clk or when reset is asserted.
- Ensure all flip-flops and registers have explicitly defined initial values, particularly ensuring the FSM starts in state A upon reset.

This specification ensures that the functional intent is preserved while adding clarity for implementation, addressing all necessary design constraints and initial conditions.
