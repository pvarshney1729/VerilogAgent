Module Name: TopModule

Interface Details:
- Inputs:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal (1-bit). This is a positive edge triggered reset.
  - `input in`: Input signal (1-bit).

- Output:
  - `output reg out`: Output signal (1-bit).

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- States: Four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.
- Initial State: State A

Reset Behavior:
- The asynchronous reset (`areset`) immediately resets the state machine to state A when triggered by a positive edge.

State Transition Table:
- The state transitions are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.
- The output is determined solely by the current state.

  | Current State | Next State when in=0 | Next State when in=1 | Output |
  |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
  | A             | A                    | B                    | 0      |
  | B             | C                    | B                    | 0      |
  | C             | A                    | D                    | 0      |
  | D             | C                    | B                    | 1      |

Bit Conventions:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.
- Bit indices are not applicable as all signals are single-bit.

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and outputs are updated on the positive edge of the `clk`, except when the `areset` is activated.

Edge Cases:
- The state machine is guaranteed to return to state A upon the assertion of the `areset` signal, regardless of the current state or input.
- Outputs are defined for all states, ensuring predictable behavior at all times.

All operational details have been explicitly defined to ensure clarity and correctness in the implementation of the module.
