Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Details:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal (1-bit). This is a positive edge triggered reset.\n  - `input in`: Input signal (1-bit).\n\n- Output:\n  - `output reg out`: Output signal (1-bit).\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Type: Moore State Machine\n- States: Four states labeled as A, B, C, and D.\n- Initial State: State A\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The asynchronous reset (`areset`) immediately resets the state machine to state A when triggered by a positive edge.\n\nState Transition Table:\n- The state transitions are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.\n- The output is determined solely by the current state.\n\n  | Current State | Next State when in=0 | Next State when in=1 | Output |\n  |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|\n  | A             | A                    | B                    | 0      |\n  | B             | C                    | B                    | 0      |\n  | C             | A                    | D                    | 0      |\n  | D             | C                    | B                    | 1      |\n\nBit Conventions:\n- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.\n- Bit indices are not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions and outputs are updated on the positive edge of the `clk`, except when the `areset` is activated.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The state machine is guaranteed to return to state A upon the assertion of the `areset` signal, regardless of the current state or input.\n- Outputs are defined for all states, ensuring predictable behavior at all times.\n\nAll operational details have been explicitly defined to ensure clarity and correctness in the implementation of the module.\n                    "
