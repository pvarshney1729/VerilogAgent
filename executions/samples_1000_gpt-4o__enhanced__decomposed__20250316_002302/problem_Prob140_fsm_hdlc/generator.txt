<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` according to the given specification, we need to design a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) that detects specific bit patterns in a serial data stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
2. **ONE_1**: Detected one '1'.
3. **TWO_1**: Detected two consecutive '1's.
4. **THREE_1**: Detected three consecutive '1's.
5. **FOUR_1**: Detected four consecutive '1's.
6. **FIVE_1**: Detected five consecutive '1's.
7. **SIX_1**: Detected six consecutive '1's.
8. **SEVEN_1**: Detected seven consecutive '1's, indicating an error.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input bit `in`. The outputs `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are asserted based on the current state and input, as follows:

- **disc**: Asserted when the FSM detects the pattern `0111110`.
- **flag**: Asserted when the FSM detects the pattern `01111110`.
- **err**: Asserted when the FSM detects seven or more consecutive '1's.

The FSM uses a synchronous reset, which means the reset signal is sampled on the positive edge of the clock. The outputs are asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.

The implementation will follow the coding conventions provided, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring the reset is handled synchronously.
