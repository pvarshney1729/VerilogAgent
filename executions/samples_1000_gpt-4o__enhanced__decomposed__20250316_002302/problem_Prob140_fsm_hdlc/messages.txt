        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, used for synchronizing sequential logic. Triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `input reset`: Reset signal, active high, synchronous. Resets the FSM to its initial state.\n  - `input in`: Serial data input, 1-bit wide.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output disc`: Indicates a bit needs to be discarded, 1-bit wide.\n  - `output flag`: Indicates the detection of a frame boundary, 1-bit wide.\n  - `output err`: Indicates an error due to detecting 7 or more consecutive '1's, 1-bit wide.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to process a continuous bit stream and recognize specific bit patterns:\n   - Pattern (1): `0111110` - Signals a bit needs to be discarded. Assert `disc` for one full clock cycle following detection.\n   - Pattern (2): `01111110` - Indicates a frame boundary (beginning/end). Assert `flag` for one full clock cycle following detection.\n   - Pattern (3): `01111111...` - Detects 7 or more consecutive '1's indicating an error. Assert `err` for one full clock cycle following detection.\n\n2. FSM Operation:\n   - Initial State: Upon reset, the FSM enters the initial state as if the previous input was '0'.\n   - State Transitions: On each positive clock edge, the FSM transitions based on the current state and input bit.\n   - Output Assertion: Outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted for a full clock cycle after the corresponding pattern detection.\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n   - The reset is synchronous, meaning its effect occurs on the positive edge of the clock.\n   - When reset is active (high), the FSM transitions to the initial state.\n\n4. Bit Indexing and Conventions:\n   - Input and output ports are 1-bit wide, with bit[0] as the least significant bit where applicable.\n   - The FSM operates on a bit-by-bit basis from the serial input stream.\n\n5. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n   - The FSM correctly handles transitions between states without race conditions.\n   - Ensure proper handling of consecutive '1's and insertion of zeros as per HDLC framing rules.\n\n6. Assumptions:\n   - All sequential logic elements are initialized properly upon reset.\n   - The clock signal is stable and free of glitches.\n\nThis specification provides a clear and precise guide for implementing the TopModule with the described functionality.\n                    "
