<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, used for synchronizing sequential logic. Triggered on the positive edge.
  - `input reset`: Reset signal, active high, synchronous. Resets the FSM to its initial state.
  - `input in`: Serial data input, 1-bit wide.

- Output Ports:
  - `output disc`: Indicates a bit needs to be discarded, 1-bit wide.
  - `output flag`: Indicates the detection of a frame boundary, 1-bit wide.
  - `output err`: Indicates an error due to detecting 7 or more consecutive '1's, 1-bit wide.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to process a continuous bit stream and recognize specific bit patterns:
   - Pattern (1): `0111110` - Signals a bit needs to be discarded. Assert `disc` for one full clock cycle following detection.
   - Pattern (2): `01111110` - Indicates a frame boundary (beginning/end). Assert `flag` for one full clock cycle following detection.
   - Pattern (3): `01111111...` - Detects 7 or more consecutive '1's indicating an error. Assert `err` for one full clock cycle following detection.

2. FSM Operation:
   - Initial State: Upon reset, the FSM enters the initial state as if the previous input was '0'.
   - State Transitions: On each positive clock edge, the FSM transitions based on the current state and input bit.
   - Output Assertion: Outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted for a full clock cycle after the corresponding pattern detection.

3. Reset Behavior:
   - The reset is synchronous, meaning its effect occurs on the positive edge of the clock.
   - When reset is active (high), the FSM transitions to the initial state.

4. Bit Indexing and Conventions:
   - Input and output ports are 1-bit wide, with bit[0] as the least significant bit where applicable.
   - The FSM operates on a bit-by-bit basis from the serial input stream.

5. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
   - The FSM correctly handles transitions between states without race conditions.
   - Ensure proper handling of consecutive '1's and insertion of zeros as per HDLC framing rules.

6. Assumptions:
   - All sequential logic elements are initialized properly upon reset.
   - The clock signal is stable and free of glitches.

This specification provides a clear and precise guide for implementing the TopModule with the described functionality.
