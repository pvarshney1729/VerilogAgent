The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

- `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.
- `input reset`: Reset signal, active high, synchronous. Resets the FSM to its initial state.
- `input s`: Control signal used only in the initial state A.
- `input w`: Data signal evaluated during certain states for FSM transitions.
- `output z`: Output signal, determined based on the FSM's evaluation of input `w`.

The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with inputs `s` and `w`. Details are as follows:

1. **Initial State and Reset Behavior**:
   - The FSM begins in state `A` upon reset.
   - The `reset` signal, when asserted, synchronously returns the FSM to state `A`.

2. **FSM State Transitions**:
   - **State A**: The FSM remains in state `A` as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, it transitions to state `B` at the next positive edge of the clock.
   - **State B**: Upon entering state `B`, the FSM evaluates the input `w` over the next three clock cycles.

3. **State B Logic**:
   - During the three clock cycles in state `B`, the FSM counts the occurrences of `w = 1`.
   - If `w = 1` in exactly two of these three cycles, the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 during the next clock cycle after the three-cycle evaluation. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.
   - After setting `z`, the FSM immediately starts a new three-cycle evaluation of `w`.

4. **Output Signal `z`**:
   - The output `z` is updated based on the evaluation of `w` only after the completion of the three-cycle count within state `B`.

5. **Clock and Reset Specifications**:
   - All sequential operations are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
   - The `reset` signal is synchronous, meaning the FSM transitions to state `A` on the next clock cycle after the reset is asserted.

6. **Input and Output Conventions**:
   - Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.
   - Ensure that the state transitions and output logic are free from race conditions by adhering to the specified clock cycle timing.

7. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - When transitioning from state `A` to `B`, only the value of `s` is considered.
   - While in state `B`, only `w` is considered for counting purposes.

This specification aims to clarify the functional intent and ensure a correct implementation of the FSM using a minimum number of states.
