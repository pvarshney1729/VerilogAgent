        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.\n\n- `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.\n- `input reset`: Reset signal, active high, synchronous. Resets the FSM to its initial state.\n- `input s`: Control signal used only in the initial state A.\n- `input w`: Data signal evaluated during certain states for FSM transitions.\n- `output z`: Output signal, determined based on the FSM's evaluation of input `w`.\n\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with inputs `s` and `w`. Details are as follows:\n\n1. **Initial State and Reset Behavior**:\n   - The FSM begins in state `A` upon reset.\n   - The `reset` signal, when asserted, synchronously returns the FSM to state `A`.\n\n2. **FSM State Transitions**:\n   - **State A**: The FSM remains in state `A` as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, it transitions to state `B` at the next positive edge of the clock.\n   - **State B**: Upon entering state `B`, the FSM evaluates the input `w` over the next three clock cycles.\n\n3. **State B Logic**:\n   - During the three clock cycles in state `B`, the FSM counts the occurrences of `w = 1`.\n   - If `w = 1` in exactly two of these three cycles, the FSM sets the output `z` to 1 during the next clock cycle after the three-cycle evaluation. Otherwise, `z` is set to 0.\n   - After setting `z`, the FSM immediately starts a new three-cycle evaluation of `w`.\n\n4. **Output Signal `z`**:\n   - The output `z` is updated based on the evaluation of `w` only after the completion of the three-cycle count within state `B`.\n\n5. **Clock and Reset Specifications**:\n   - All sequential operations are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n   - The `reset` signal is synchronous, meaning the FSM transitions to state `A` on the next clock cycle after the reset is asserted.\n\n6. **Input and Output Conventions**:\n   - Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n   - Ensure that the state transitions and output logic are free from race conditions by adhering to the specified clock cycle timing.\n\n7. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - When transitioning from state `A` to `B`, only the value of `s` is considered.\n   - While in state `B`, only `w` is considered for counting purposes.\n\nThis specification aims to clarify the functional intent and ensure a correct implementation of the FSM using a minimum number of states.\n                    "
