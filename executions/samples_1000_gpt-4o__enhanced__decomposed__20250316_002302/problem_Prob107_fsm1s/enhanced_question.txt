<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named `TopModule` will implement a Moore state machine with the following interface:

- `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronization, positive edge-triggered.
- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- `input wire in`: Input signal to the state machine.
- `output reg out`: Output signal of the state machine.

### State Machine Description:

The state machine has two states:
- State A
- State B

State encoding is as follows for a 1-bit state representation:
- State A is encoded as 0.
- State B is encoded as 1.

### Reset Behavior:
- Upon the assertion of the `reset` signal, the state machine transitions to State B.
- The reset is synchronous and takes effect on the rising edge of `clk`.

### State Transitions:
- From State B (output `out=1`):
  - If `in=0`, transition to State A.
  - If `in=1`, remain in State B.
- From State A (output `out=0`):
  - If `in=0`, transition to State B.
  - If `in=1`, remain in State A.

### Output Logic:
- In State A, `out` is 0.
- In State B, `out` is 1.

### Signal Conventions:
- All signals are assumed to be active-high.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.

This specification ensures that the module behaves as a Moore state machine with well-defined transitions and output behavior based on the current state and input.
