Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named `TopModule` will implement a Moore state machine with the following interface:\n\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronization, positive edge-triggered.\n- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- `input wire in`: Input signal to the state machine.\n- `output reg out`: Output signal of the state machine.\n\n### State Machine Description:\n\nThe state machine has two states:\n- State A\n- State B\n\nState encoding is as follows for a 1-bit state representation:\n- State A is encoded as 0.\n- State B is encoded as 1.\n\n### Reset Behavior:\n- Upon the assertion of the `reset` signal, the state machine transitions to State B.\n- The reset is synchronous and takes effect on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n### State Transitions:\n- From State B (output `out=1`):\n  - If `in=0`, transition to State A.\n  - If `in=1`, remain in State B.\n- From State A (output `out=0`):\n  - If `in=0`, transition to State B.\n  - If `in=1`, remain in State A.\n\n### Output Logic:\n- In State A, `out` is 0.\n- In State B, `out` is 1.\n\n### Signal Conventions:\n- All signals are assumed to be active-high.\n- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.\n\nThis specification ensures that the module behaves as a Moore state machine with well-defined transitions and output behavior based on the current state and input.\n                    "

Use a local parameter to represent each state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding using local parameters\n  localparam STATE_A = 1'b0;\n  localparam STATE_B = 1'b1;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register to hold the current state.

Define transitions: B to A on in=0, B to B on in=1, A to B on in=0, and A to A on in=1.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam STATE_A = 1'b0;\n  localparam STATE_B = 1'b1;\n\n  // State transition logic\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      state <= STATE_B; // Reset state\n    end else begin\n      case (state)\n        STATE_B: state <= (in == 1'b0) ?

Set out=1 when in state B and out=0 when in state A.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam STATE_A = 1'b0;\n  localparam STATE_B = 1'b1;\n\n  reg current_state;\n  reg out;\n\n  // Output logic for Moore machine\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_A: out = 1'b0;\n      STATE_B: out = 1'b1;\n      default: out = 1'b0; // Default case for safety\n    endcase\n  end\n                    "
