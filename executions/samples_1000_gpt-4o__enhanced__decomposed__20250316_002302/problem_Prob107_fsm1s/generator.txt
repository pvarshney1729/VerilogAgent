To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to follow the provided specifications and guidelines. The state machine has two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, not the input, which is characteristic of a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a single bit to encode the states. Let's assign `0` to State A and `1` to State B.

2. **State Register**: We'll use a sequential always block to update the current state on the rising edge of `clk`. The reset is synchronous, so we'll check for the `reset` signal within this block and set the state to B when `reset` is high.

3. **State Transition Logic**: We'll use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. In State A, `out` is `0`, and in State B, `out` is `1`.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We'll declare all ports and internal signals as `logic`. We'll use `always @(*)` for combinational logic and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we ensure the implementation adheres to the specifications and guidelines provided.
