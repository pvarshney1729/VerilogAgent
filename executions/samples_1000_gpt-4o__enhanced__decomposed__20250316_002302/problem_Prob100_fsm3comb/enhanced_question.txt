Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in`: 1-bit input signal for state transition conditions.
  - `input wire [1:0] state`: 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. State encoding is as follows:
    - State A: 2'b00
    - State B: 2'b01
    - State C: 2'b10
    - State D: 2'b11

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire [1:0] next_state`: 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine.
  - `output wire out`: 1-bit output signal.

Design Specification:
- This module is a combinational logic block implementing the state transition and output logic for a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.

- State Transition Logic:
  - When in state A (2'b00):
    - If `in` = 0, transition to state A (2'b00).
    - If `in` = 1, transition to state B (2'b01).
  - When in state B (2'b01):
    - If `in` = 0, transition to state C (2'b10).
    - If `in` = 1, remain in state B (2'b01).
  - When in state C (2'b10):
    - If `in` = 0, transition to state A (2'b00).
    - If `in` = 1, transition to state D (2'b11).
  - When in state D (2'b11):
    - If `in` = 0, transition to state C (2'b10).
    - If `in` = 1, transition to state B (2'b01).

- Output Logic:
  - The output `out` is determined solely by the current state:
    - State A: `out` = 0
    - State B: `out` = 0
    - State C: `out` = 0
    - State D: `out` = 1

Additional Notes:
- The state machine is purely combinational; it does not include sequential elements such as flip-flops or registers. Therefore, there is no clock or reset signal involved.
- All inputs and outputs follow the convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- Ensure the combinational logic is free from hazards and race conditions by properly implementing logic gates and ensuring correct signal propagation.
