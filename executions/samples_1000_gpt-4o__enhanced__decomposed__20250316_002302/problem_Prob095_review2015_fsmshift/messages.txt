        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal, 1-bit, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `reset`: Reset signal, 1-bit, active high, synchronous with `clk`.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `shift_ena`: Output signal to enable the shift register, 1-bit.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register. The FSM will enable the shift register for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles under specific conditions.\n\nBehavior:\n1. Reset Behavior:\n   - When `reset` is asserted (active high), the `shift_ena` output should be asserted (set to 1) for the first 4 clock cycles after the reset is detected.\n   - After 4 clock cycles, `shift_ena` should be deasserted (set to 0) indefinitely until the next reset.\n\n2. Clock Cycle Dependency:\n   - The FSM transitions and logic updates are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - The reset is synchronous; it is sampled on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n\n3. Initial Conditions:\n   - All internal FSM state registers must be initialized to a known state after reset.\n\n4. Edge Cases:\n   - Ensure that during the reset period, the FSM counts exactly 4 clock cycles before deasserting `shift_ena`.\n   - Post-reset behavior must ensure `shift_ena` remains low until the next reset.\n\nOther Considerations:\n- The FSM should be designed to handle transitions cleanly without glitches or race conditions on the `shift_ena` output.\n- Clearly define and document the state transition conditions and outputs in the FSM design.\n\nEnsure all aspects of the FSM design, especially the reset handling and clock cycle counting, are clearly defined and implemented to meet the specified behavior.\n                    "
