<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named `TopModule` should be designed with the following interface:

- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire in`: A single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [3:0] state`: A 4-bit input representing the current state of the Moore state machine.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output reg [3:0] next_state`: A 4-bit output indicating the next state of the state machine.
  - `output reg out`: A single-bit output signal.

**State Encoding:**
The Moore state machine uses a one-hot encoding scheme with the following state assignments:
- State A: `4'b0001`
- State B: `4'b0010`
- State C: `4'b0100`
- State D: `4'b1000`

**State Transition Table:**
The state transition logic is defined as follows:

- **Current State A:**
  - Next state when `in = 0`: Remain in A (`next_state = 4'b0001`)
  - Next state when `in = 1`: Transition to B (`next_state = 4'b0010`)
  - Output `out = 0`

- **Current State B:**
  - Next state when `in = 0`: Transition to C (`next_state = 4'b0100`)
  - Next state when `in = 1`: Remain in B (`next_state = 4'b0010`)
  - Output `out = 0`

- **Current State C:**
  - Next state when `in = 0`: Transition to A (`next_state = 4'b0001`)
  - Next state when `in = 1`: Transition to D (`next_state = 4'b1000`)
  - Output `out = 0`

- **Current State D:**
  - Next state when `in = 0`: Transition to C (`next_state = 4'b0100`)
  - Next state when `in = 1`: Transition to B (`next_state = 4'b0010`)
  - Output `out = 1`

**Implementation Notes:**
- The logic described is purely combinational. Thus, there are no clock or reset signals required as part of this specification.
- The module does not include any sequential elements, and there are no initial conditions or reset states specified, as the logic is purely combinational.
- Ensure that all combinational logic reflects the one-hot encoding scheme accurately.
- Handle all possible one-hot encoded states and ensure that transitions adhere strictly to the state transition table provided.
