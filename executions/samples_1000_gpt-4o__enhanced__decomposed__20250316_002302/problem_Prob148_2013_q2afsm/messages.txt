Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for TopModule:\n\n1. **Module Interface:**\n\n   - Input Ports:\n     - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit, positive edge-triggered).\n     - `resetn`: Active-low, synchronous reset (1 bit).\n     - `r`: Request signal from devices, a 3-bit vector where `r[0]` is the highest priority request and `r[2]` is the lowest priority.\n\n   - Output Ports:\n     - `g`: Grant signal to devices, a 3-bit vector where `g[0]` corresponds to granting device 0, `g[1]` to device 1, and `g[2]` to device 2.\n\n2. **Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:**\n\n   - **States:**\n     - State `A`: Initial state with no requests granted.\n     - State `B`: `g[0] = 1`, granting device 0.\n     - State `C`: `g[1] = 1`, granting device 1.\n     - State `D`: `g[2] = 1`, granting device 2.\n\n   - **State Transitions:**\n     - From State `A`:\n       - Transition to `B` if `r[0] = 1`.\n       - Transition to `C` if `r[0] = 0` and `r[1] = 1`.\n       - Transition to `D` if `r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, and `r[2] = 1`.\n       - Remain in `A` if `r[0] = 0`, `r[1] = 0`, and `r[2] = 0`.\n\n     - From State `B`:\n       - Remain in `B` if `r[0] = 1`.\n       - Transition to `A` if `r[0] = 0`.\n\n     - From State `C`:\n       - Remain in `C` if `r[1] = 1`.\n       - Transition to `A` if `r[1] = 0`.\n\n   - **Reset Behavior:**\n     - On `resetn` being asserted low, the FSM resets synchronously to State `A`.\n\n3. **Implementation Guidelines:**\n\n   - Use separate `always` blocks:\n     - One for state transitions (combinational logic).\n     - One for state memory (sequential logic, triggered on the positive edge of `clk`).\n\n   - Use either continuous assignment statements or an `always` block to describe the output logic for `g`.\n\n   - Assign appropriate binary codes to the states for implementation, ensuring clarity and simplicity.\n\n   - Assure all flip-flops and registers have explicitly defined initial values.\n\n4. **Precedence and Edge Cases:**\n\n   - Priority is given to `r[0]` over `r[1]`, and `r[1]` over `r[2]`.\n   - Device 2 (`r[2]`) will only be granted if it is the sole requester when the FSM is in state `A`.\n\n5. **Bit Indexing Convention:**\n\n   - `r[0]`, `r[1]`, `r[2]` refer to requests from devices 0, 1, and 2 respectively, with `r[0]` having the highest priority.\n   - `g[0]`, `g[1]`, `g[2]` refer to grants for devices 0, 1, and 2 respectively.\n\nEnsure the design is free from race conditions and reflects the intended arbitration policy. The implementation should be robust to handle all possible input scenarios within the defined constraints.\n                    "
