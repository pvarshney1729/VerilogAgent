<REASONING>
To implement the 32-bit Galois LFSR as specified, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is `q`, which is 32 bits wide.

2. **Signal Declaration**: Use `logic` for declaring the output `q` to adhere to the coding conventions.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the output `q` to `32'h1` when the `reset` signal is high. This reset should be sampled on the positive edge of the clock.

4. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the Galois LFSR logic. The LFSR should shift right, and the new value of `q[31]` should be the XOR of the current `q[0]` with the taps at positions 31, 21, 1, and 0.

5. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always_ff` block to describe the sequential logic that updates the LFSR state on the positive edge of the clock.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specification and adheres to the provided guidelines and coding conventions.

        end
