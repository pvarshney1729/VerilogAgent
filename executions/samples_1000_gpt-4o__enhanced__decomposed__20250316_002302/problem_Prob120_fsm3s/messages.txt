Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input wire reset` : Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n  - `input wire in` : One-bit data input.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out` : One-bit output.\n\nDescription:\nThis module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D. The state machine transitions and outputs are defined as follows:\n\nStates and Transitions:\n- State A:\n  - If `in` is 0, transition to State A.\n  - If `in` is 1, transition to State B.\n  - Output: 0\n\n- State B:\n  - If `in` is 0, transition to State C.\n  - If `in` is 1, remain in State B.\n  - Output: 0\n\n- State C:\n  - If `in` is 0, transition to State A.\n  - If `in` is 1, transition to State D.\n  - Output: 0\n\n- State D:\n  - If `in` is 0, transition to State C.\n  - If `in` is 1, transition to State B.\n  - Output: 1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The FSM is reset synchronously to State A on the positive edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.\n\nGeneral Specifications:\n- The state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The reset is synchronous, and the FSM enters State A regardless of the current state whenever `reset` is asserted high during a clock cycle.\n- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per Moore FSM characteristics, and is unaffected by the `in` signal during state transitions.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit in any multi-bit signals, though all current ports are single bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure the FSM correctly handles all possible combinations of `in` and `reset` at every clock cycle, particularly during state transitions and reset conditions.\n                    "

The output 'out' should be determined solely by the current state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// Output logic for the Moore state machine\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      2'b00: out = 1'b0; // State A\n      2'b01: out = 1'b0; // State B\n      2'b10: out = 1'b0; // State C\n      2'b11: out = 1'b1; // State D\n      default: out = 1'b0;\n    endcase\n  end\n                    "
