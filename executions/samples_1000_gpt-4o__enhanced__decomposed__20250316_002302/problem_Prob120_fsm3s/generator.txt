<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The module will have a synchronous reset, meaning the reset signal is sampled with respect to the clock. The state machine has four states (A, B, C, D), and the transitions depend on the input `in`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore FSM characteristics.

1. **State Encoding**: We'll use a 2-bit logic type to represent the four states. This allows us to efficiently encode the states and manage transitions.

2. **State Register**: We'll implement a state register to hold the current state, which will be updated on the positive edge of the clock. The reset logic will ensure that the FSM resets to state A when the reset signal is high.

3. **Next State Logic**: We'll use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output will be determined by the current state using a simple case statement.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We'll adhere to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the module behaves as specified and adheres to the provided guidelines and coding conventions.
