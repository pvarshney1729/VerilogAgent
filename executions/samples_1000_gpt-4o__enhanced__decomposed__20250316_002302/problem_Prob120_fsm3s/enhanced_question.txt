Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input wire reset` : Synchronous active-high reset signal.
  - `input wire in` : One-bit data input.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out` : One-bit output.

Description:
This module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D. The state machine transitions and outputs are defined as follows:

States and Transitions:
- State A:
  - If `in` is 0, transition to State A.
  - If `in` is 1, transition to State B.
  - Output: 0

- State B:
  - If `in` is 0, transition to State C.
  - If `in` is 1, remain in State B.
  - Output: 0

- State C:
  - If `in` is 0, transition to State A.
  - If `in` is 1, transition to State D.
  - Output: 0

- State D:
  - If `in` is 0, transition to State C.
  - If `in` is 1, transition to State B.
  - Output: 1

Reset Behavior:
- The FSM is reset synchronously to State A on the positive edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.

General Specifications:
- The state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- The reset is synchronous, and the FSM enters State A regardless of the current state whenever `reset` is asserted high during a clock cycle.
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per Moore FSM characteristics, and is unaffected by the `in` signal during state transitions.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit in any multi-bit signals, though all current ports are single bit.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure the FSM correctly handles all possible combinations of `in` and `reset` at every clock cycle, particularly during state transitions and reset conditions.
