        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.\n  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [2:0] q`: 3-bit output register. Initial value is undefined.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- Bit Indexing: `q[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- The signal `clk` is a clock input driving sequential logic, and `a` is a control signal affecting the behavior of `q`.\n\nClocking and Reset:\n- The circuit is synchronous and operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n- There is no explicit reset signal provided; hence, the initial state of `q` is 'unknown' or 'x'.\n\nSequential Logic Description:\n- The output `q` is updated at each rising edge of the clock (`clk`).\n- The behavior of the module is observed from the provided simulation waveform.\n\nSimulation Waveform Behavior:\n- When `a` is high (1), `q` remains at the value 4 (binary 100).\n- When `a` transitions to low (0), `q` increments by 1 with each rising edge of `clk`.\n- The value of `q` rolls over after reaching 6 (binary 110), resetting to 0.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The transition from `q = 6` to `q = 0` indicates a rollover behavior in a 3-bit counter when `a` is low.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Ensure that input signal `a` is stable and transitions are synchronized with `clk` to avoid metastability.\n- The implementation must ensure that the circuit follows the specified waveform behavior precisely.\n\nThe module is fully described by the given waveform, and no additional states or behaviors are implied beyond what is provided.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
