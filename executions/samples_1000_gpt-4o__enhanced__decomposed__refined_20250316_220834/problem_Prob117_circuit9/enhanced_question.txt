Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.
  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [2:0] q`: 3-bit output register. Initial value is undefined.

Signal Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: `q[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
- The signal `clk` is a clock input driving sequential logic, and `a` is a control signal affecting the behavior of `q`.

Clocking and Reset:
- The circuit is synchronous and operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.
- There is no explicit reset signal provided; hence, the initial state of `q` is 'unknown' or 'x'.

Sequential Logic Description:
- The output `q` is updated at each rising edge of the clock (`clk`).
- The behavior of the module is observed from the provided simulation waveform.

Simulation Waveform Behavior:
- When `a` is high (1), `q` remains at the value 4 (binary 100).
- When `a` transitions to low (0), `q` increments by 1 with each rising edge of `clk`.
- The value of `q` rolls over after reaching 6 (binary 110), resetting to 0.

Edge Case Handling:
- The transition from `q = 6` to `q = 0` indicates a rollover behavior in a 3-bit counter when `a` is low.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure that input signal `a` is stable and transitions are synchronized with `clk` to avoid metastability.
- The implementation must ensure that the circuit follows the specified waveform behavior precisely.

The module is fully described by the given waveform, and no additional states or behaviors are implied beyond what is provided.
