Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)
  - `input wire b` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)
  - `input wire c` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)
  - `input wire d` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out` : 1-bit output, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)

Functional Specification:
- The module `TopModule` implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following Karnaugh map:

       ab
  cd   00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

- The variables `a` and `b` represent the column indices, while `c` and `d` represent the row indices of the Karnaugh map.
- The output `out` should be determined by the intersection of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` according to the Karnaugh map:
  - When `cd` is "00", `ab` is "01" or "10", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.
  - When `cd` is "01", `ab` is "00" or "11", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.
  - When `cd` is "11", `ab` is "01" or "10", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.
  - When `cd` is "10", `ab` is "00" or "11", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.

- Ensure there are no race conditions, as the logic is purely combinational.

- Note: This module does not contain any sequential elements, clock signals, or reset conditions.

Edge Cases:
- All possible input combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are explicitly covered by the Karnaugh map.
