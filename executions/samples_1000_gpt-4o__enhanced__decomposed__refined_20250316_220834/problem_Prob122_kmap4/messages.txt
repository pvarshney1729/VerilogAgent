Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire a` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)\n  - `input wire b` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)\n  - `input wire c` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)\n  - `input wire d` : 1-bit input, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out` : 1-bit output, represents bit[0] (least significant bit)\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module `TopModule` implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following Karnaugh map:\n\n       ab\n  cd   00  01  11  10\n  00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n  11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n\n- The variables `a` and `b` represent the column indices, while `c` and `d` represent the row indices of the Karnaugh map.\n- The output `out` should be determined by the intersection of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` according to the Karnaugh map:\n  - When `cd` is \"00\", `ab` is \"01\" or \"10\", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.\n  - When `cd` is \"01\", `ab` is \"00\" or \"11\", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.\n  - When `cd` is \"11\", `ab` is \"01\" or \"10\", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.\n  - When `cd` is \"10\", `ab` is \"00\" or \"11\", `out` is 1, otherwise 0.\n\n- Ensure there are no race conditions, as the logic is purely combinational.\n\n- Note: This module does not contain any sequential elements, clock signals, or reset conditions.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- All possible input combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are explicitly covered by the Karnaugh map.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
