Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a` : Bit index 0, represents the least significant bit for 'ab' pair
  - `input wire b` : Bit index 1, represents the most significant bit for 'ab' pair
  - `input wire c` : Bit index 0, represents the least significant bit for 'cd' pair
  - `input wire d` : Bit index 1, represents the most significant bit for 'cd' pair

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out` : Single bit output

Functional Description:
- The module implements combinational logic based on the provided Karnaugh map. The output `out` is determined by the combinations of the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
  
Karnaugh Map Representation:
- The Karnaugh map has been defined for the truth table as follows, where:
  - The horizontal axis represents the `ab` combination.
  - The vertical axis represents the `cd` combination.

  |   ab \ cd  |  00  |  01  |  11  |  10  |
  |------------|------|------|------|------|
  | **00**     |  1   |  1   |  0   |  1   |
  | **01**     |  1   |  0   |  0   |  1   |
  | **11**     |  0   |  1   |  1   |  1   |
  | **10**     |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |

Implementation Notes:
- The module is purely combinational and does not depend on clock cycles or sequential logic.
- All inputs and outputs are treated as single-bit signals.
- The circuit's logic should be minimized using appropriate techniques such as boolean algebra or automated tools if necessary, based on the given Karnaugh map.
- Ensure that there is no assumption about initial values as the circuit is combinational.

Edge Cases:
- Since all inputs are 1-bit, consider all 16 possible combinations of input values when verifying correctness.
- No additional reset or initialization considerations are required in this combinational circuit.
