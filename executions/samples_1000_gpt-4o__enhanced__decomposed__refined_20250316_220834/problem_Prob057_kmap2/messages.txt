Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire a` : Bit index 0, represents the least significant bit for 'ab' pair\n  - `input wire b` : Bit index 1, represents the most significant bit for 'ab' pair\n  - `input wire c` : Bit index 0, represents the least significant bit for 'cd' pair\n  - `input wire d` : Bit index 1, represents the most significant bit for 'cd' pair\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out` : Single bit output\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements combinational logic based on the provided Karnaugh map. The output `out` is determined by the combinations of the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.\n  \nKarnaugh Map Representation:\n- The Karnaugh map has been defined for the truth table as follows, where:\n  - The horizontal axis represents the `ab` combination.\n  - The vertical axis represents the `cd` combination.\n\n  |   ab \\ cd  |  00  |  01  |  11  |  10  |\n  |------------|------|------|------|------|\n  | **00**     |  1   |  1   |  0   |  1   |\n  | **01**     |  1   |  0   |  0   |  1   |\n  | **11**     |  0   |  1   |  1   |  1   |\n  | **10**     |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The module is purely combinational and does not depend on clock cycles or sequential logic.\n- All inputs and outputs are treated as single-bit signals.\n- The circuit's logic should be minimized using appropriate techniques such as boolean algebra or automated tools if necessary, based on the given Karnaugh map.\n- Ensure that there is no assumption about initial values as the circuit is combinational.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Since all inputs are 1-bit, consider all 16 possible combinations of input values when verifying correctness.\n- No additional reset or initialization considerations are required in this combinational circuit.\n                    "
