Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `y` : 6-bit vector (bit[5] is the most significant bit, bit[0] is the least significant bit), representing the current state in one-hot encoding.
  - `w` : 1-bit input signal, used as the state transition trigger.
- Outputs:
  - `Y1` : 1-bit output signal, derived from state logic.
  - `Y3` : 1-bit output signal, derived from state logic.

State Machine Description:
- States: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Encoding:
  - State A: y = 6'b000001
  - State B: y = 6'b000010
  - State C: y = 6'b000100
  - State D: y = 6'b001000
  - State E: y = 6'b010000
  - State F: y = 6'b100000

- State Transitions:
  - From State A:
    - `w` = 0: Transition to State B
    - `w` = 1: Remain in State A
  - From State B:
    - `w` = 0: Transition to State C
    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D
  - From State C:
    - `w` = 0: Transition to State E
    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D
  - From State D:
    - `w` = 0: Transition to State F
    - `w` = 1: Transition to State A
  - From State E:
    - `w` = 0: Remain in State E
    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D
  - From State F:
    - `w` = 0: Transition to State C
    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D

Reset Behavior:
- The module uses an asynchronous reset signal, which initializes the state machine to State A (y = 6'b000001).

Output Logic:
- `Y1` and `Y3` are output signals derived from the state machine logic as follows:
  - `Y1` relates to the state associated with y[1] (State B).
  - `Y3` relates to the state associated with y[3] (State D).

Next-State Logic:
- Implement the next-state logic for y[1] and y[3] based on the current state `y` and input `w`, using the one-hot encoding and the state transition diagram provided.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure correct handling of transitions at the boundaries of the state machine.
- All state transitions should be evaluated on the positive edge of the clock cycle unless otherwise specified.

The module is designed to be synthesized for digital hardware, ensuring that all logical operations and state transitions adhere to the defined specifications.
