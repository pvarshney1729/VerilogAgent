Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `y` : 6-bit vector (bit[5] is the most significant bit, bit[0] is the least significant bit), representing the current state in one-hot encoding.\n  - `w` : 1-bit input signal, used as the state transition trigger.\n- Outputs:\n  - `Y1` : 1-bit output signal, derived from state logic.\n  - `Y3` : 1-bit output signal, derived from state logic.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- States: A, B, C, D, E, F\n- Encoding:\n  - State A: y = 6'b000001\n  - State B: y = 6'b000010\n  - State C: y = 6'b000100\n  - State D: y = 6'b001000\n  - State E: y = 6'b010000\n  - State F: y = 6'b100000\n\n- State Transitions:\n  - From State A:\n    - `w` = 0: Transition to State B\n    - `w` = 1: Remain in State A\n  - From State B:\n    - `w` = 0: Transition to State C\n    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D\n  - From State C:\n    - `w` = 0: Transition to State E\n    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D\n  - From State D:\n    - `w` = 0: Transition to State F\n    - `w` = 1: Transition to State A\n  - From State E:\n    - `w` = 0: Remain in State E\n    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D\n  - From State F:\n    - `w` = 0: Transition to State C\n    - `w` = 1: Transition to State D\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module uses an asynchronous reset signal, which initializes the state machine to State A (y = 6'b000001).\n\nOutput Logic:\n- `Y1` and `Y3` are output signals derived from the state machine logic as follows:\n  - `Y1` relates to the state associated with y[1] (State B).\n  - `Y3` relates to the state associated with y[3] (State D).\n\nNext-State Logic:\n- Implement the next-state logic for y[1] and y[3] based on the current state `y` and input `w`, using the one-hot encoding and the state transition diagram provided.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure correct handling of transitions at the boundaries of the state machine.\n- All state transitions should be evaluated on the positive edge of the clock cycle unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe module is designed to be synthesized for digital hardware, ensuring that all logical operations and state transitions adhere to the defined specifications.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
