Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module is named `TopModule` and has the following interface specifications. All ports are defined with their respective bit-widths and naming conventions for clarity:\n\n- Input Ports:\n  - `x`: A 4-bit unsigned input vector, where `x[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `x[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `f`: A 1-bit output signal, representing the result of the logic function derived from the Karnaugh map.\n\nThe function `f` is defined by the following Karnaugh map, which uses the input vector `x` to determine its value. The bits `x[2]x[3]` form the rows, and `x[0]x[1]` form the columns:\n\n```\n            x[0]x[1]\nx[2]x[3]  00  01  11  10\n  00     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n  01     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n  11     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n  10     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n```\n\n- The map indicates the value of `f` for each combination of `x[3:0]`.\n- The function is purely combinational with no sequential elements.\n- Ensure that the implementation correctly maps these combinations without any race conditions or undefined states.\n\nImplementers should handle the combinational logic without any dependencies on clock edges or reset signals, as this module does not include any sequential elements.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n"
