<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module is named `TopModule` and has the following interface specifications. All ports are defined with their respective bit-widths and naming conventions for clarity:

- Input Ports:
  - `x`: A 4-bit unsigned input vector, where `x[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `x[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `f`: A 1-bit output signal, representing the result of the logic function derived from the Karnaugh map.

The function `f` is defined by the following Karnaugh map, which uses the input vector `x` to determine its value. The bits `x[2]x[3]` form the rows, and `x[0]x[1]` form the columns:

```
            x[0]x[1]
x[2]x[3]  00  01  11  10
  00     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  10     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
```

- The map indicates the value of `f` for each combination of `x[3:0]`.
- The function is purely combinational with no sequential elements.
- Ensure that the implementation correctly maps these combinations without any race conditions or undefined states.

Implementers should handle the combinational logic without any dependencies on clock edges or reset signals, as this module does not include any sequential elements.
