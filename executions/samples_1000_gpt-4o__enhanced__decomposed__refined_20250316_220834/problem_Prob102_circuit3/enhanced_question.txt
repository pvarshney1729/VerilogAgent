Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a  // 1-bit input
  - input wire b  // 1-bit input
  - input wire c  // 1-bit input
  - input wire d  // 1-bit input

- Output Ports:
  - output wire q  // 1-bit output

Circuit Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- The input and output ports are 1-bit wide and unsigned.
- The module processes the inputs to produce the output `q` based on the simulation waveform provided.

Truth Table:
- The behavior of the circuit is defined by the following truth table, derived from the simulation waveform:

  | a | b | c | d | q |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- The output `q` is computed directly from inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` without any clock or state dependencies, ensuring purely combinational behavior.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- All possible combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are covered by the truth table.
- The output `q` is defined for every combination of input values.

Note:
- The bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and the logic is interpreted accordingly.
- There are no sequential elements or state retention; thus, no resets or clock signals are involved.
