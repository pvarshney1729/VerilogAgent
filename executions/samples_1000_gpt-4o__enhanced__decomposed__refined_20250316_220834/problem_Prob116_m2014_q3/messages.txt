        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: \n  - x: 4-bit vector, unsigned (`input wire [3:0] x`)\n    - Bit indexing: `x[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB), `x[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Output: \n  - f: 1-bit (`output wire f`)\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module computes the output `f` based on the values of the 4-bit input `x` using the specified Karnaugh map. The Karnaugh map is interpreted as follows, using `x[3]x[4]` for row selection and `x[1]x[2]` for column selection:\n\n  ```\n                x[1]x[2]\n    x[3]x[4]   00  01  11  10\n          00 | d | 0 | d | d |\n          01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |\n          11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |\n          10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |\n  ```\n\n- The symbol `d` represents a don't-care condition, meaning the output `f` can be either 0 or 1 for those combinations of `x`.\n\nOperational Clarifications:\n- The function `f` is purely combinational, with no sequential elements or state dependencies.\n- Ensure that all possible input combinations are covered, and the output for don't-care conditions (`d`) should be chosen to optimize the logic implementation.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- All 16 combinations of the 4-bit input `x` are accounted for in the Karnaugh map. The output for these combinations has been defined directly or as don't-care, allowing flexibility in implementation.\n- The output `f` must be stable and immediately reflect changes in the input `x`, adhering to the combinational nature of the logic.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- No clock or reset signals are involved as this is a purely combinational module.\n- Ensure that the logic implementation adheres to the specified Karnaugh map, with emphasis on optimizing the logic gate usage where possible.\n                    "
