        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input logic a  // Bit 0 of the input word\n  - input logic b  // Bit 1 of the input word\n  - input logic c  // Bit 2 of the input word\n  - input logic d  // Bit 3 of the input word\n- Output Ports:\n  - output logic out_sop  // Output in minimum sum-of-products form\n  - output logic out_pos  // Output in minimum product-of-sums form\n\nSpecification:\n1. Inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are considered as a 4-bit binary number, with 'a' as the least significant bit (LSB) and 'd' as the most significant bit (MSB). Thus, the 4-bit input is represented as {d, c, b, a}.\n\n2. The module generates a logic-1 when the input pattern corresponds to the decimal numbers 2, 7, or 15:\n   - 2: {d, c, b, a} = 0010\n   - 7: {d, c, b, a} = 0111\n   - 15: {d, c, b, a} = 1111\n\n3. The module generates a logic-0 when the input pattern corresponds to the decimal numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14:\n   - 0: {d, c, b, a} = 0000\n   - 1: {d, c, b, a} = 0001\n   - 4: {d, c, b, a} = 0100\n   - 5: {d, c, b, a} = 0101\n   - 6: {d, c, b, a} = 0110\n   - 9: {d, c, b, a} = 1001\n   - 10: {d, c, b, a} = 1010\n   - 13: {d, c, b, a} = 1101\n   - 14: {d, c, b, a} = 1110\n\n4. The input conditions for the numbers 3, 8, 11, and 12 ({d, c, b, a} = 0011, 1000, 1011, 1100, respectively) are considered don't-care conditions and will not occur in this system.\n\n5. Output 'out_sop' should be derived using the minimum sum-of-products form based on the specified logic-1 conditions.\n\n6. Output 'out_pos' should be derived using the minimum product-of-sums form based on the specified logic-0 conditions.\n\nOperation Details:\n- Both outputs 'out_sop' and 'out_pos' must be combinational logic outputs, directly dependent on the current values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.\n- No clock or reset signals are necessary as the module is purely combinational.\n                    "
