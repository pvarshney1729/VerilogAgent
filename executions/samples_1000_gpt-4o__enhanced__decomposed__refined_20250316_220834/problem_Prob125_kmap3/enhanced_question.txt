Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire a` (1-bit, unsigned)
  - `input wire b` (1-bit, unsigned)
  - `input wire c` (1-bit, unsigned)
  - `input wire d` (1-bit, unsigned)
- Output:
  - `output wire out` (1-bit, unsigned)

Design Specification:
1. The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the given Karnaugh map, which simplifies to a truth table.

2. Bit Indexing and Mapping:
   - Inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are single-bit signals.
   - The inputs `a` and `b` determine the column index.
   - The inputs `c` and `d` determine the row index, where `d` is a don't-care condition.

3. Karnaugh Map Representation:
   ```
              ab
     cd   | 01 | 00 | 10 | 11 |
     00   |  x |  0 |  1 |  1 |
     01   |  0 |  0 |  x |  x |
     11   |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
     10   |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
   ```
   - Here, 'x' indicates a don't-care condition where the output can be either 0 or 1.

4. Output Logic:
   - The output `out` is derived from the simplified boolean expression of the Karnaugh map.
   - The output logic should be optimized to minimize logic gates while maintaining the functionality defined by the map.

5. Constraints and Conditions:
   - The module operates purely combinationally, without any clock or sequential elements.
   - There are no reset conditions since no memory or state elements are used.
   - Ensure that all possible input combinations are accounted for, with don't-care conditions leveraged to simplify logic.

6. Edge Cases:
   - The circuit should handle all possible combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and produce consistent output according to the specified logic.

Note: The don't-care conditions ('x') can be used to optimize the circuit but should not affect correct operation for specified input conditions.
