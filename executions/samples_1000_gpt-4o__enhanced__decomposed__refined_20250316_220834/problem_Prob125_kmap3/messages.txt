        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input wire a` (1-bit, unsigned)\n  - `input wire b` (1-bit, unsigned)\n  - `input wire c` (1-bit, unsigned)\n  - `input wire d` (1-bit, unsigned)\n- Output:\n  - `output wire out` (1-bit, unsigned)\n\nDesign Specification:\n1. The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the given Karnaugh map, which simplifies to a truth table.\n\n2. Bit Indexing and Mapping:\n   - Inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are single-bit signals.\n   - The inputs `a` and `b` determine the column index.\n   - The inputs `c` and `d` determine the row index, where `d` is a don't-care condition.\n\n3. Karnaugh Map Representation:\n   ```\n              ab\n     cd   | 01 | 00 | 10 | 11 |\n     00   |  x |  0 |  1 |  1 |\n     01   |  0 |  0 |  x |  x |\n     11   |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |\n     10   |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |\n   ```\n   - Here, 'x' indicates a don't-care condition where the output can be either 0 or 1.\n\n4. Output Logic:\n   - The output `out` is derived from the simplified boolean expression of the Karnaugh map.\n   - The output logic should be optimized to minimize logic gates while maintaining the functionality defined by the map.\n\n5. Constraints and Conditions:\n   - The module operates purely combinationally, without any clock or sequential elements.\n   - There are no reset conditions since no memory or state elements are used.\n   - Ensure that all possible input combinations are accounted for, with don't-care conditions leveraged to simplify logic.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - The circuit should handle all possible combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and produce consistent output according to the specified logic.\n\nNote: The don't-care conditions ('x') can be used to optimize the circuit but should not affect correct operation for specified input conditions.\n                    "
