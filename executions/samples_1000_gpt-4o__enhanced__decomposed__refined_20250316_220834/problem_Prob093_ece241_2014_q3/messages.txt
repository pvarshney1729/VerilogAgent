        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification: TopModule\n\nOverview:\nImplement a module named \"TopModule\" with a specified interface. The module will generate a 4-bit output vector, \"mux_in\", which interfaces with a 4-to-1 multiplexer to realize a given Karnaugh map. The multiplexer uses \"a\" and \"b\" as selector inputs.\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `c`: 1-bit input, unsigned.\n  - `d`: 1-bit input, unsigned.\n- Outputs:\n  - `mux_in`: 4-bit output vector, unsigned, indexed from bit[3] (MSB) to bit[0] (LSB).\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n- Use a combination of one 4-to-1 multiplexer and the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers to implement the Karnaugh map.\n- Only the inputs \"a\" and \"b\" are used as selector inputs for the 4-to-1 multiplexer.\n- No additional logic gates are permitted.\n\nKarnaugh Map Representation:\n\n      ab\n  cd  00  01  11  10\n  00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n  11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n  10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n\nMapping:\n- For selector inputs {a, b}:\n  - When ab = 00, connect mux_in[0].\n  - When ab = 01, connect mux_in[1].\n  - When ab = 11, connect mux_in[2].\n  - When ab = 10, connect mux_in[3].\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure each bit of \"mux_in\" corresponds to the truth values derived from the Karnaugh map for the respective conditions of inputs \"c\" and \"d\".\n- The design should ensure correct logical mapping without introducing race conditions or glitches.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Handle all possible combinations of inputs \"c\" and \"d\" to ensure correct output on \"mux_in\" for each selector state of the 4-to-1 multiplexer.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- This specification does not involve sequential logic, hence no clock or reset signals are required.\n\nObjective:\nThe objective is to create a reliable and efficient combinational logic design that adheres to the given constraints and accurately implements the specified Karnaugh map using multiplexers.\n                    "
