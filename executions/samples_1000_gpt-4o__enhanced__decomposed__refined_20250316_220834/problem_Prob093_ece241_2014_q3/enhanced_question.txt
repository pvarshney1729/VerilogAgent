Module Specification: TopModule

Overview:
Implement a module named "TopModule" with a specified interface. The module will generate a 4-bit output vector, "mux_in", which interfaces with a 4-to-1 multiplexer to realize a given Karnaugh map. The multiplexer uses "a" and "b" as selector inputs.

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `c`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
  - `d`: 1-bit input, unsigned.
- Outputs:
  - `mux_in`: 4-bit output vector, unsigned, indexed from bit[3] (MSB) to bit[0] (LSB).

Functional Requirements:
- Use a combination of one 4-to-1 multiplexer and the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers to implement the Karnaugh map.
- Only the inputs "a" and "b" are used as selector inputs for the 4-to-1 multiplexer.
- No additional logic gates are permitted.

Karnaugh Map Representation:

      ab
  cd  00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Mapping:
- For selector inputs {a, b}:
  - When ab = 00, connect mux_in[0].
  - When ab = 01, connect mux_in[1].
  - When ab = 11, connect mux_in[2].
  - When ab = 10, connect mux_in[3].

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure each bit of "mux_in" corresponds to the truth values derived from the Karnaugh map for the respective conditions of inputs "c" and "d".
- The design should ensure correct logical mapping without introducing race conditions or glitches.

Edge Cases:
- Handle all possible combinations of inputs "c" and "d" to ensure correct output on "mux_in" for each selector state of the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

Clock and Reset:
- This specification does not involve sequential logic, hence no clock or reset signals are required.

Objective:
The objective is to create a reliable and efficient combinational logic design that adheres to the given constraints and accurately implements the specified Karnaugh map using multiplexers.
