// Enhanced Specification for a Safety Controller Module

// Module Name: SafetyController
// Description: This module monitors the CPU temperature and fuel status to control the computer's operation
//              and vehicle driving decisions. Outputs are controlled based on the inputs to ensure safe operation.

module SafetyController (
    input logic cpu_overheated,        // 1-bit input: indicates if the CPU is overheated
    input logic arrived,               // 1-bit input: indicates if the destination has been reached
    input logic gas_tank_empty,        // 1-bit input: indicates if the gas tank is empty
    output logic shut_off_computer,    // 1-bit output: signal to shut off the computer
    output logic keep_driving          // 1-bit output: signal to keep driving the vehicle
);

// Combinational Logic Block
// This block describes the logic for controlling outputs based on current input conditions.
always_comb begin
    // By default, the outputs are set to a safe state
    shut_off_computer = 1'b0; // Default state: do not shut off the computer
    keep_driving = 1'b0;      // Default state: do not keep driving

    // Shut off the computer if the CPU is overheated
    if (cpu_overheated) begin
        shut_off_computer = 1'b1;
    end

    // Decide whether to keep driving based on arrival and fuel status
    if (~arrived) begin
        keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty; // Keep driving only if the gas tank is not empty
    end
end
