Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1-bit, active-high synchronous reset.
  - in: 1-bit input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output signal.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
  - States: 
    - State B: Output 'out' is 1.
    - State A: Output 'out' is 0.
  - Reset: 
    - Active-high synchronous reset.
    - Upon activation of the reset signal, the state machine transitions to State B.
  - State Transitions:
    - From State B: 
      - If 'in' = 0, transition to State A.
      - If 'in' = 1, remain in State B.
    - From State A: 
      - If 'in' = 0, transition to State B.
      - If 'in' = 1, remain in State A.

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- The state transition occurs on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal.
- The reset is synchronous; hence, the state transition to State B occurs on the next rising edge of 'clk' when the 'reset' signal is asserted.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the state machine initializes to State B, where the output 'out' is set to 1.

Bit Indexing:
- Since all ports are single-bit, no specific indexing is applicable.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that at power-up, the system is properly reset to State B to establish a known starting condition.
- If the 'reset' signal is asserted and deasserted within the same clock cycle, the state machine will remain in State B as per synchronous reset behavior.
