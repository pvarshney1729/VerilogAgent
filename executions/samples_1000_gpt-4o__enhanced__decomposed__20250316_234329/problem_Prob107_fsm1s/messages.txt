Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - reset: 1-bit, active-high synchronous reset.\n  - in: 1-bit input signal.\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output signal.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:\n  - States: \n    - State B: Output 'out' is 1.\n    - State A: Output 'out' is 0.\n  - Reset: \n    - Active-high synchronous reset.\n    - Upon activation of the reset signal, the state machine transitions to State B.\n  - State Transitions:\n    - From State B: \n      - If 'in' = 0, transition to State A.\n      - If 'in' = 1, remain in State B.\n    - From State A: \n      - If 'in' = 0, transition to State B.\n      - If 'in' = 1, remain in State A.\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- The state transition occurs on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal.\n- The reset is synchronous; hence, the state transition to State B occurs on the next rising edge of 'clk' when the 'reset' signal is asserted.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, the state machine initializes to State B, where the output 'out' is set to 1.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Since all ports are single-bit, no specific indexing is applicable.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that at power-up, the system is properly reset to State B to establish a known starting condition.\n- If the 'reset' signal is asserted and deasserted within the same clock cycle, the state machine will remain in State B as per synchronous reset behavior.\n                    "
