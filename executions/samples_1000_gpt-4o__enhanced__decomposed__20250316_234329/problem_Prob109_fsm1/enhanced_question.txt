Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input clk: Clock signal for synchronizing state transitions. 
- input areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. 
- input in: Input signal to determine state transitions.
- output reg out: Output signal representing the current state's output.

Port Widths and Significance:
- All ports (clk, areset, in) are 1-bit wide.
- The output 'out' is driven by the current state.

State Machine Description:
- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B.
- State Encoding: 
  - State A: Encoded as 1'b0
  - State B: Encoded as 1'b1

State Transition and Output Logic:
- The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows:
  - From State B (out = 1):
    - On input '0', transition to State A.
    - On input '1', remain in State B.
  - From State A (out = 0):
    - On input '0', transition to State B.
    - On input '1', remain in State A.

Asynchronous Reset:
- The state machine should transition to State B when 'areset' is high, irrespective of the clock.
- The reset state of the state machine is State B.

Clock and Sequential Logic:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of 'clk'.
- The output 'out' is updated synchronously with the state transitions.

Initial Conditions:
- On initialization, or when 'areset' is asserted, the module should default to State B, with 'out' set to 1.

Note:
- Ensure the design accounts for any potential race conditions by prioritizing the asynchronous reset over synchronous state transitions.
