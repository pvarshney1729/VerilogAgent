Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire clk: Clock signal. Positive edge-triggered.
- input wire reset: Synchronous active high reset signal.
- input wire in: One-bit input signal.
- output reg out: One-bit output signal.

State Machine Description:
- This module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with four states: A, B, C, and D.
- State Encoding: 
  * State A: 2'b00
  * State B: 2'b01
  * State C: 2'b10
  * State D: 2'b11
- Initial State: On reset, the FSM transitions to State A.

Clock and Reset:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
- The reset is a synchronous signal, meaning it is sampled on the rising edge of the clock.
- When reset is high, the FSM transitions to State A, and the output is set according to State A.

State Transition Table:
- Current State: A
  * Next State if in=0: A
  * Next State if in=1: B
  * Output: 0
- Current State: B
  * Next State if in=0: C
  * Next State if in=1: B
  * Output: 0
- Current State: C
  * Next State if in=0: A
  * Next State if in=1: D
  * Output: 0
- Current State: D
  * Next State if in=0: C
  * Next State if in=1: B
  * Output: 1

Output Behavior:
- The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state (Moore machine characteristic) and is updated on the rising edge of the clock.
- State A, B, and C produce an output of 0.
- State D produces an output of 1.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- Ensure the reset signal is properly synchronized with the clock to avoid metastability.
- The FSM should correctly handle rapid changes in the input signal 'in' by evaluating it only at the clock's positive edge.

Note: All state transitions and outputs are stable between clock edges, ensuring that there are no race conditions or glitches.
