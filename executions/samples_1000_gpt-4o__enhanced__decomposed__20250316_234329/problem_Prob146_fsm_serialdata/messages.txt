        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit), triggers all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n  - `in`: Serial data input (1 bit).\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset (1 bit), initializes all registers to their default states on the next clock edge when asserted.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out_byte`: 8-bit output port representing the received data byte. Valid only when `done` is asserted.\n  - `done`: 1-bit output indicating the completion of a byte reception and the validity of `out_byte`.\n\nFunctional Behavior:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to decode a serial communication protocol characterized by:\n  - One start bit (logic 0).\n  - Eight data bits transmitted least significant bit (LSB) first.\n  - One stop bit (logic 1).\n  - Idle line state at logic 1 when no data is being transmitted.\n\n- FSM Operation:\n  - Start State: Waits for a transition from idle (logic 1) to the start bit (logic 0).\n  - Data Reception: After detecting the start bit, the FSM captures the following 8 data bits, one per clock cycle.\n  - Stop Bit Verification: After the 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (logic 1).\n    - If the stop bit is correctly detected, `out_byte` is updated with the received data, and `done` is asserted (set to 1) for one clock cycle to indicate the completion of byte reception.\n    - If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM waits for an idle state (logic 1) before attempting to find the next start bit.\n\n- Edge Case Behavior:\n  - If an incorrect stop bit is detected, the FSM does not update `out_byte` and does not assert `done`.\n  - The FSM restarts the search for a start bit only after detecting a stop bit or idle state.\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - On `reset` assertion, all internal registers (including those holding partial data and state information) are initialized to their default states on the next positive clock edge.\n  - The FSM transitions to an initial state, ready to detect the next valid start bit.\n\nNote:\n- Bit Indexing: The least significant bit (bit[0]) of `out_byte` corresponds to the first data bit received after the start bit.\n                    "
