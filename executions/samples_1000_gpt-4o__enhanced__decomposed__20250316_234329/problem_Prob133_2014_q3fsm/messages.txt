Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input clk: Clock signal, used to drive sequential logic. Triggered on the positive edge.\n- input reset: Active high, synchronous reset signal. Resets the FSM to the initial state A.\n- input s: Control signal used to transition from state A to state B.\n- input w: Input signal examined in state B across multiple clock cycles.\n- output z: Output signal set based on the FSM logic.\n\nPort Widths and Conventions:\n- All input and output ports are single-bit signals (1-bit wide).\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit if applicable in expanded designs.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Specification:\n- Initial State: The FSM begins in State A upon reset.\n- State A: \n  - The FSM remains in State A as long as input s = 0.\n  - Transition to State B occurs when the input s = 1 on a positive clock edge.\n- State B:\n  - Once in State B, the FSM examines the input w over the next three consecutive clock cycles.\n  - If input w = 1 in exactly two of these three clock cycles, the output z is set to 1 in the following clock cycle.\n  - If the condition is not met (w = 1 in fewer than or more than two cycles), the output z is set to 0.\n  - The FSM continues to evaluate the input w in batches of three clock cycles while in State B.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is active high and synchronous, meaning it is recognized on the rising edge of the clock.\n- Upon reset, the FSM transitions to State A, and any internal counters or registers used to track the state of input w should also be reset to their initial values.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential elements, such as flip-flops or registers used in the FSM, are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Initial states for all registers should be explicitly defined to avoid undefined behavior.\n\nOperational Precedence and Edge Cases:\n- The input signal s is only relevant in State A and has no effect in State B.\n- The input w is irrelevant in State A and only influences transitions and output generation in State B.\n- Ensure that operations are performed in a way that prevents race conditions and ambiguity in signal evaluation.\n\nThis specification ensures a clear understanding and implementation of the FSM within the TopModule, with explicit definitions of state transitions, signal dependencies, and reset conditions.\n                    "
