Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk`: The clock signal for the sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input wire reset`: An active-high synchronous reset signal that initializes the FSM and all registers to their default state.
  - `input wire in`: Serial input stream containing the data bits.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg done`: Indicates successful receipt of a byte with correct start and stop bits.

Port Width and Conventions:
- All ports are single-bit signals.

FSM Description:
- The finite state machine (FSM) will operate based on the following states:
  - IDLE: The line is at logic 1, waiting for a start bit (logic 0).
  - START: Detects the start bit (logic 0) and transitions to receiving data bits.
  - DATA[7:0]: Sequentially captures 8 data bits, starting from the least significant bit (LSB). `bit[0]` refers to the LSB, and `bit[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
  - STOP: Verifies the presence of the stop bit (logic 1) after 8 data bits.
  - ERROR: If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM enters this state and waits for a valid stop bit to reset the reception process.

Behavior:
- Reset: Upon receiving an active-high reset signal, the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and any stored data is cleared.
- Start Bit Detection: Transition from IDLE to START occurs when a start bit (logic 0) is detected.
- Data Bit Reception: From the START state, the FSM collects 8 data bits (DATA[7:0]) on each positive clock edge.
- Stop Bit Verification: After receiving the 8th data bit, the FSM transitions to the STOP state to verify the presence of a stop bit (logic 1).
- Successful Reception: If the stop bit is detected correctly, the `done` signal is asserted high for one clock cycle.
- Error Handling: If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM enters the ERROR state. It remains there until a logic 1 (idle or stop bit) is detected, upon which it returns to the IDLE state.

Clock and Reset:
- All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
- The reset is synchronous, and all registers initialize to a known state upon reset.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM handles unexpected sequences by returning to the IDLE state if the expected start or stop bits are not found.
- The `done` signal is only asserted if a complete byte, including correct start and stop bits, is received successfully.

Note:
- The serial protocol assumes LSB-first transmission for the 8 data bits.
