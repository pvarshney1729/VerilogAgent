Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: The clock signal for the sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `input wire reset`: An active-high synchronous reset signal that initializes the FSM and all registers to their default state.\n  - `input wire in`: Serial input stream containing the data bits.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg done`: Indicates successful receipt of a byte with correct start and stop bits.\n\nPort Width and Conventions:\n- All ports are single-bit signals.\n\nFSM Description:\n- The finite state machine (FSM) will operate based on the following states:\n  - IDLE: The line is at logic 1, waiting for a start bit (logic 0).\n  - START: Detects the start bit (logic 0) and transitions to receiving data bits.\n  - DATA[7:0]: Sequentially captures 8 data bits, starting from the least significant bit (LSB). `bit[0]` refers to the LSB, and `bit[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n  - STOP: Verifies the presence of the stop bit (logic 1) after 8 data bits.\n  - ERROR: If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM enters this state and waits for a valid stop bit to reset the reception process.\n\nBehavior:\n- Reset: Upon receiving an active-high reset signal, the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and any stored data is cleared.\n- Start Bit Detection: Transition from IDLE to START occurs when a start bit (logic 0) is detected.\n- Data Bit Reception: From the START state, the FSM collects 8 data bits (DATA[7:0]) on each positive clock edge.\n- Stop Bit Verification: After receiving the 8th data bit, the FSM transitions to the STOP state to verify the presence of a stop bit (logic 1).\n- Successful Reception: If the stop bit is detected correctly, the `done` signal is asserted high for one clock cycle.\n- Error Handling: If the stop bit is not detected, the FSM enters the ERROR state. It remains there until a logic 1 (idle or stop bit) is detected, upon which it returns to the IDLE state.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.\n- The reset is synchronous, and all registers initialize to a known state upon reset.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM handles unexpected sequences by returning to the IDLE state if the expected start or stop bits are not found.\n- The `done` signal is only asserted if a complete byte, including correct start and stop bits, is received successfully.\n\nNote:\n- The serial protocol assumes LSB-first transmission for the 8 data bits.\n                    "
