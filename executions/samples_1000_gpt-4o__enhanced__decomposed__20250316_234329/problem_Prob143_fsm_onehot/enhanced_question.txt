Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: 
  - `input wire in;` // Single-bit input signal
  - `input wire [9:0] state;` // 10-bit one-hot encoded current state vector
- Output:
  - `output reg [9:0] next_state;` // 10-bit one-hot encoded next state vector
  - `output reg out1;` // Single-bit output for specific state conditions
  - `output reg out2;` // Single-bit output for specific state conditions

State Encoding:
- States are one-hot encoded:
  - `state[0]` corresponds to S0
  - `state[1]` corresponds to S1
  - ...
  - `state[9]` corresponds to S9

State Transition Logic:
- The module implements combinational logic to determine `next_state` based on `state` and `in`.
- State transitions are defined as:
  - From S0: 
    - `in == 0` -> Stay in S0
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S1
  - From S1:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S0
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S2
  - From S2:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S0
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S3
  - From S3:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S0
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S4
  - From S4:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S0
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S5
  - From S5:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S8
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S6
  - From S6:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S9
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S7
  - From S7:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S0
    - `in == 1` -> Stay in S7
  - From S8:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S0
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S1
  - From S9:
    - `in == 0` -> Transition to S0
    - `in == 1` -> Transition to S1

Output Logic:
- Outputs are zero unless explicitly specified by the state:
  - `out1` is set to 1 when in states S8 or S9.
  - `out2` is set to 1 when in states S7 or S9.

Additional Notes:
- The module does not include flip-flops for state storage; it receives the current state externally.
- The `next_state` output is determined combinationally, without additional clock or reset signals.
- Each bit in `next_state[9:0]` is set high if the corresponding state is the next state, otherwise set low.
- Ensure that only one bit in `next_state` is high at any given time, reflecting one-hot encoding.
