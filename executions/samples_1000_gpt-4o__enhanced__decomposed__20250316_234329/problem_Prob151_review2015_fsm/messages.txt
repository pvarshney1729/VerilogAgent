        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive-edge triggered.\n- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- `input wire data`: Serial input data stream.\n- `input wire done_counting`: Signal indicating completion of counting from external counter.\n- `input wire ack`: Acknowledge signal from the user.\n- `output reg shift_ena`: Control signal to enable shifting, active for 4 clock cycles after pattern detection.\n- `output reg counting`: Control signal indicating the module is waiting for counting to complete.\n- `output reg done`: Signal to notify the user that the timer has completed.\n\nOperation Details:\n1. **Pattern Detection**: The state machine starts by searching for the bit pattern \"1101\" on the `data` input. This pattern detection is performed on the rising edge of the clock.\n\n2. **Shifting**: Upon detecting the pattern \"1101\", the state machine asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles to allow the subsequent 4 bits on `data` to be shifted in and determine the delay duration.\n\n3. **Counting**: After the 4-bit shift operation, the state machine asserts the `counting` signal, indicating it is waiting for the external counter to finish. It remains in this state until `done_counting` is high.\n\n4. **Notification and Acknowledgment**: Once `done_counting` is high, the state machine asserts `done` to notify the user that the timer has completed. The state machine waits in this state until the `ack` signal from the user is high.\n\n5. **Reset Behavior**: The state machine includes a synchronous reset mechanism. When `reset` is asserted high, the state machine immediately transitions to the initial state, ready to begin searching for the \"1101\" pattern again.\n\nState Machine Characteristics:\n- The state machine is fully synchronous, operating on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The initial state upon reset is configured to search for the pattern \"1101\".\n- All registers and output signals are initialized to their default states on reset.\n- Bit indexing for state machine operations should consider `bit[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- Ensure input signals `data`, `done_counting`, and `ack` are stable and synchronized to the `clk` to prevent metastability.\n- The pattern detection should be robust against bit shifts and should reset if an incorrect sequence is detected before completion.\n- The module's behavior in scenarios of simultaneous assertion of `reset` and valid state transitions is well-defined, prioritizing the reset action.\n\nNote: The data path components, such as counters and comparators, are assumed to be managed externally and are not part of this specification.\n                    "
