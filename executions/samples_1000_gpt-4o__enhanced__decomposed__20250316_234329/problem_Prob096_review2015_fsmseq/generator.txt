<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to design a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in a serial input stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
2. **S1**: Detected the first '1'.
3. **S11**: Detected two consecutive '1's.
4. **S110**: Detected the sequence '110'.
5. **S1101**: Detected the complete sequence '1101'.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. Once the sequence `1101` is detected, the FSM enters the `S1101` state, and the output `start_shifting` is set to `1`. This output remains `1` until a synchronous reset occurs.

The reset is synchronous, meaning it is checked on the rising edge of the clock. The `start_shifting` output is a register that is set when the FSM reaches the `S1101` state.

The implementation will follow the coding conventions and guidelines provided, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring the reset logic is synchronous.
