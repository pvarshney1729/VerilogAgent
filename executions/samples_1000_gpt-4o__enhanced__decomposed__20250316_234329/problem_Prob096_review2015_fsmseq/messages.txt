        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. All sequential logic is triggered on the rising edge of this clock.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input. When high, reset all state elements to their initial state on the next rising clock edge.\n  - `data`: 1-bit serial input data stream.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `start_shifting`: 1-bit output signal. This signal is set to 1 when the sequence 1101 is detected in the input stream and remains 1 until the next reset.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the sequence 1101 in the incoming `data` stream.\n- The FSM transitions through states representing the progress of detecting the sequence:\n  - Initial state (reset state): Wait for the first '1' of the sequence.\n  - Detect the first '1'.\n  - Detect the second consecutive '1'.\n  - Detect '0' following the two '1's.\n  - Detect the final '1' to complete the sequence 1101.\n- Upon successful detection of the sequence 1101, the `start_shifting` output is set to 1 and remains high, irrespective of further input, until a reset occurs.\n\nState Machine Details:\n- The FSM is synchronous, advancing states on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- State transitions depend on the current state and the value of `data` at each clock cycle.\n- The reset condition sets the FSM to the initial state, and `start_shifting` is reset to 0.\n\nBit Conventions:\n- `data` is treated as a stream of bits where the most recent bit is always the least significant in the context of sequence detection.\n- State encoding and transitions are designed to avoid race conditions and ensure reliable sequence detection.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Reset is synchronous. When `reset` is asserted (high) on a rising clock edge, all state registers are initialized to their default state, and `start_shifting` is reset to 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the sequence 1101 is detected, subsequent detection of the sequence in the absence of a reset is ignored, as `start_shifting` remains high.\n- The FSM correctly handles overlapping sequences, resetting to the appropriate state upon detecting the first '1' after detecting the sequence.\n\nThis specification ensures precise implementation of the desired functionality while maintaining clarity in the design intent and operational conditions.\n                    "
