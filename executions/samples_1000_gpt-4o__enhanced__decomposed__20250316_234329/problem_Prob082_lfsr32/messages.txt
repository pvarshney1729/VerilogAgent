Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input clk`: Clock signal, triggers all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n- `input reset`: Active high synchronous reset signal.\n- `output reg [31:0] q`: 32-bit output register representing the state of the LFSR.\n\nLFSR Definition:\n- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- Taps are positioned at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0, where a tap at position `i` means `q[i]` is XORed with `q[0]` to compute the next state of `q[i]`.\n- The LFSR shifts right, with `q[0]` being the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous and should occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n- When reset is active (`reset = 1`), the output `q` is set to 32'h00000001.\n\nOperational Description:\n- On every positive edge of the clock, if reset is not active (`reset = 0`), the LFSR shifts right.\n- The new value of `q[31]` is computed as `q[0] ^ q[22] ^ q[2] ^ q[1]`, and other bits shift right unchanged.\n- Ensure all flip-flops have a defined initial value during reset.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When reset is active, the output `q` should immediately reset to 32'h00000001 on the next clock edge.\n- Under normal operation, the LFSR should cycle through its states as determined by the tap positions and initial state.\n\nBit Indexing Conventions:\n- `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- `q[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nThe module does not include any asynchronous logic, and all operations are synchronous with respect to the `clk` signal.\n                    "
