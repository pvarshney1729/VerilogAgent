Module Specification: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input clk`: Clock signal, triggers all sequential logic on the positive edge.
- `input reset`: Active high synchronous reset signal.
- `output reg [31:0] q`: 32-bit output register representing the state of the LFSR.

LFSR Definition:
- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- Taps are positioned at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0, where a tap at position `i` means `q[i]` is XORed with `q[0]` to compute the next state of `q[i]`.
- The LFSR shifts right, with `q[0]` being the least significant bit (LSB).

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous and should occur on the positive edge of the clock.
- When reset is active (`reset = 1`), the output `q` is set to 32'h00000001.

Operational Description:
- On every positive edge of the clock, if reset is not active (`reset = 0`), the LFSR shifts right.
- The new value of `q[31]` is computed as `q[0] ^ q[22] ^ q[2] ^ q[1]`, and other bits shift right unchanged.
- Ensure all flip-flops have a defined initial value during reset.

Edge Cases:
- When reset is active, the output `q` should immediately reset to 32'h00000001 on the next clock edge.
- Under normal operation, the LFSR should cycle through its states as determined by the tap positions and initial state.

Bit Indexing Conventions:
- `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
- `q[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB).

The module does not include any asynchronous logic, and all operations are synchronous with respect to the `clk` signal.
