        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [4:0] q`: 5-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR. Bit indexing is such that `q[4]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctionality:\n- This module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- The LFSR has taps at bit positions 5 (`q[4]`) and 3 (`q[2]`).\n\nOperation:\n- Upon a positive clock edge:\n  - If `reset` is high, the LFSR output `q` is reset to the value `5'b00001`.\n  - If `reset` is low, the LFSR operates normally:\n    - The next state of the LFSR is determined by shifting the current state right by one bit.\n    - The new MSB (`q[4]`) is determined by XORing `q[0]` (current LSB) with the current values at the tap positions `q[2]` (third bit) and `q[4]` (fifth bit).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The LFSR cycles through all possible non-zero states (i.e., 31 unique states for a 5-bit LFSR) before repeating. The all-zero state is explicitly avoided by design.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous and active-high. During reset, the LFSR is initialized to a known non-zero state (`5'b00001`).\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- When the system is initialized, if the reset is applied, the LFSR will start from the state `5'b00001` upon the next positive edge of the clock.\n                    "
