<REASONING>
To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified interface, including inputs `clk` and `reset`, and output `q` which is 5 bits wide.

2. **Signal Declaration**: Use `logic` to declare the internal register that will hold the current state of the LFSR. This register will be updated on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset within the sequential logic block. When `reset` is high, the LFSR should be set to the initial state `5'b00001`.

4. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the LFSR logic using a Galois configuration. The next state is determined by shifting the current state right and XORing the LSB with the taps at positions 5 and 3. This is done by XORing `q[4]` and `q[2]` with `q[0]`.

5. **Output Assignment**: Assign the internal register to the output `q`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the LFSR cycles through all possible non-zero states, providing a maximal-length sequence.
