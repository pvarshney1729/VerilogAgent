Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input in`: Single-bit input signal.\n  - `input [3:0] state`: 4-bit input signal representing the current state using one-hot encoding. \n    - State encoding:\n      - A = 4'b0001\n      - B = 4'b0010\n      - C = 4'b0100\n      - D = 4'b1000\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output [3:0] next_state`: 4-bit output signal for the next state, encoded in one-hot format.\n  - `output out`: Single-bit output signal.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a Moore state machine with four states (A, B, C, D), a single input, and a single output.\n2. State transitions are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.\n3. The state transition table is as follows:\n   - State A: \n     - Next state: A if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 0\n   - State B:\n     - Next state: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 0\n   - State C:\n     - Next state: A if `in` = 0, D if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 0\n   - State D:\n     - Next state: C if `in` = 0, B if `in` = 1\n     - Output: 1\n\n4. The state machine is purely combinational, involving only the state transition logic and output logic. It does not include sequential logic elements such as flip-flops or registers within this module.\n\n5. The one-hot encoding ensures that only one bit of the state vector is high at any time, representing the current active state.\n\n6. The logic for the next state and the output should be derived directly from the state transition table, as specified above.\n\n7. All inputs and outputs are assumed to be active-high unless otherwise noted.\n                    "
