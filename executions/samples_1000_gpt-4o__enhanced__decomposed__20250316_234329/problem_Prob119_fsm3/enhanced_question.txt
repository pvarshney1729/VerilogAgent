Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `areset`: 1-bit, asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the FSM to the initial state (State A).
  - `in`: 1-bit input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output signal.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.
2. All state transitions and output behaviors are defined as follows:

   | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
   |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
   | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |
   | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |
   | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |
   | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |

3. State Encoding (Binary representation):
   - State A: 2'b00
   - State B: 2'b01
   - State C: 2'b10
   - State D: 2'b11

4. The FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. All state transitions occur at this clock edge.

5. `areset` is an asynchronous reset. When `areset` is asserted (high), the FSM immediately transitions to State A regardless of the clock signal.

6. Initial State: Upon power-up or reset, the FSM is in State A.

7. The `out` signal is driven based on the current state:
   - For States A, B, and C, `out` is 0.
   - For State D, `out` is 1.

8. Bit Indexing Convention: 
   - Use MSB to LSB ordering for multi-bit signals.
   - State encoding uses 2 bits, with bit[1] as the most significant bit and bit[0] as the least significant bit.

9. Ensure that race conditions are avoided by adhering to the edge-triggered behavior of the clock and asynchronous reset.
