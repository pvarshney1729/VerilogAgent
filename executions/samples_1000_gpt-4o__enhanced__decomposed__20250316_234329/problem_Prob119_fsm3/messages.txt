        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit, asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the FSM to the initial state (State A).\n  - `in`: 1-bit input signal.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output signal.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a Moore state machine with four states: A, B, C, and D.\n2. All state transitions and output behaviors are defined as follows:\n\n   | Current State | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |\n   |---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n   | A             | A                 | B                 | 0      |\n   | B             | C                 | B                 | 0      |\n   | C             | A                 | D                 | 0      |\n   | D             | C                 | B                 | 1      |\n\n3. State Encoding (Binary representation):\n   - State A: 2'b00\n   - State B: 2'b01\n   - State C: 2'b10\n   - State D: 2'b11\n\n4. The FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. All state transitions occur at this clock edge.\n\n5. `areset` is an asynchronous reset. When `areset` is asserted (high), the FSM immediately transitions to State A regardless of the clock signal.\n\n6. Initial State: Upon power-up or reset, the FSM is in State A.\n\n7. The `out` signal is driven based on the current state:\n   - For States A, B, and C, `out` is 0.\n   - For State D, `out` is 1.\n\n8. Bit Indexing Convention: \n   - Use MSB to LSB ordering for multi-bit signals.\n   - State encoding uses 2 bits, with bit[1] as the most significant bit and bit[0] as the least significant bit.\n\n9. Ensure that race conditions are avoided by adhering to the edge-triggered behavior of the clock and asynchronous reset.\n                    "
