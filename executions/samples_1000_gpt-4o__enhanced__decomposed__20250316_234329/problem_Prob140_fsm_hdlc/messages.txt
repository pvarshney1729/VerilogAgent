Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-sensitive.\n  - `input wire reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n  - `input wire in`: Input data stream (1-bit).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg disc`: Indicates a bit needs to be discarded.\n  - `output reg flag`: Indicates the beginning/end of a frame.\n  - `output reg err`: Indicates an error condition (7 or more consecutive 1s).\n\nDesign Specifications:\n1. **Finite State Machine (FSM):**\n   - The design should implement a Moore-type FSM to decode a continuous bit stream.\n   - Define states to recognize specific sequences: `0111110`, `01111110`, and `01111111...`.\n   - The FSM should transition states based on the input bit `in`, sampled on the positive edge of `clk`.\n\n2. **Sequences and Outputs:**\n   - Sequence `0111110`: Assert `disc` high for one clock cycle immediately following detection.\n   - Sequence `01111110`: Assert `flag` high for one clock cycle immediately following detection.\n   - Sequence `01111111` or more: Assert `err` high for one clock cycle immediately following detection.\n\n3. **Reset Behavior:**\n   - The FSM should return to an initial state as if the previous input were `0` upon a synchronous active-high reset.\n   - All output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) should be deasserted (set low) upon reset.\n\n4. **Output Definitions:**\n   - All outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) must remain asserted for exactly one clock cycle after the respective condition is detected.\n\n5. **Bit Indexing Convention:**\n   - Assume LSB-first bit ordering in sequences, i.e., bit[0] is the least significant bit.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Ensure the FSM correctly handles transitions and outputs at the boundaries between sequences.\n   - Handle potential race conditions by ensuring proper state transitions on the clock edge.\n\n7. **Operational Notes:**\n   - The FSM should be designed to handle continuous input and should not miss any potential sequence due to state transition delays.\n   - Ensure the design accounts for potential input jitter and noise by robust state transitioning.\n                    "
