        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- `input wire clk`: System clock signal. The module assumes positive edge-triggered operation.\n- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When high, the module resets to its initial state at the next positive clock edge.\n- `input wire [7:0] in`: 8-bit input representing a byte stream from the PS/2 protocol.\n- `output reg done`: 1-bit output, indicating the successful reception of a complete 3-byte message. This signal is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately following the reception of the third byte.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module operates as a finite state machine (FSM) to detect the start and end of PS/2 protocol messages within a continuous byte stream.\n- Message Identification: The first byte of each message is characterized by in[3] = 1. The FSM searches for this condition to identify the start of a new message.\n- Byte Counting: Upon detection of in[3] = 1, the FSM assumes this is byte 1 of a new message and begins counting bytes.\n- Completion Signal: Upon receiving the third byte of a message, the FSM sets the `done` signal high for one clock cycle in the subsequent clock cycle.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Initial State: The FSM starts in an idle state, continuously checking each incoming byte.\n- Transition Condition: The FSM transitions from idle to message-receiving state when in[3] = 1 is detected.\n- Byte Tracking: The FSM tracks the number of bytes received, using internal counters or state variables.\n- Transition Back to Idle: Once all 3 bytes are received, the FSM returns to the idle state, ready to detect the start of the next message.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On a synchronous reset (reset = 1), the FSM returns to its initial idle state, and `done` is reset to 0. This occurs on the next positive clock edge when reset is active.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- The FSM assumes that in[3] = 1 correctly identifies the start of a message. Any erroneous bytes before this signal do not affect the FSM's operation.\n- The FSM operates continuously, processing the byte stream without interruption unless reset is asserted.\n\nNote: All registers, counters, and internal signals should be initialized to zero or their respective default states upon reset.\n                    "
