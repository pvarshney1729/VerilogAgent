Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- `input wire clk`: System clock signal. The module assumes positive edge-triggered operation.
- `input wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. When high, the module resets to its initial state at the next positive clock edge.
- `input wire [7:0] in`: 8-bit input representing a byte stream from the PS/2 protocol.
- `output reg done`: 1-bit output, indicating the successful reception of a complete 3-byte message. This signal is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately following the reception of the third byte.

Functionality:
- The module operates as a finite state machine (FSM) to detect the start and end of PS/2 protocol messages within a continuous byte stream.
- Message Identification: The first byte of each message is characterized by in[3] = 1. The FSM searches for this condition to identify the start of a new message.
- Byte Counting: Upon detection of in[3] = 1, the FSM assumes this is byte 1 of a new message and begins counting bytes.
- Completion Signal: Upon receiving the third byte of a message, the FSM sets the `done` signal high for one clock cycle in the subsequent clock cycle.

State Machine Description:
- Initial State: The FSM starts in an idle state, continuously checking each incoming byte.
- Transition Condition: The FSM transitions from idle to message-receiving state when in[3] = 1 is detected.
- Byte Tracking: The FSM tracks the number of bytes received, using internal counters or state variables.
- Transition Back to Idle: Once all 3 bytes are received, the FSM returns to the idle state, ready to detect the start of the next message.

Reset Behavior:
- On a synchronous reset (reset = 1), the FSM returns to its initial idle state, and `done` is reset to 0. This occurs on the next positive clock edge when reset is active.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- The FSM assumes that in[3] = 1 correctly identifies the start of a message. Any erroneous bytes before this signal do not affect the FSM's operation.
- The FSM operates continuously, processing the byte stream without interruption unless reset is asserted.

Note: All registers, counters, and internal signals should be initialized to zero or their respective default states upon reset.
