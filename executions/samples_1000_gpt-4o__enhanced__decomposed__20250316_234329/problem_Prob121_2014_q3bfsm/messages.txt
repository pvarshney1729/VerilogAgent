Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this signal.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous, active-high reset input. Resets the FSM to state `000` on the next rising edge of `clk` when asserted.\n  - `x`: 1-bit input signal determining the transition condition of the FSM.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `z`: 1-bit output signal representing the FSM output based on the current state.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The FSM uses a 3-bit state register `y[2:0]` where `y[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `y[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Reset State: On assertion of `reset`, the FSM transitions to state `000` on the next rising clock edge.\n- State Transition Table:\n  - Present State `y[2:0]` | Next State `y[2:0]` if `x=0` | Next State `y[2:0]` if `x=1` | Output `z`\n    - `000` | `000` | `001` | `0`\n    - `001` | `001` | `100` | `0`\n    - `010` | `010` | `001` | `0`\n    - `011` | `001` | `010` | `1`\n    - `100` | `011` | `100` | `1`\n\nOperational Details:\n- The FSM transitions between states based on the input `x` and the current state `y[2:0]`.\n- The output `z` is determined by the current state and is updated on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- All operations are synchronous with respect to the clock signal.\n\nEdge Cases and Initial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up or reset assertion, the FSM should initialize to state `000` on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n- Ensure no race conditions exist as all state transitions and outputs are clocked.\n\nNote: This specification assumes that all inputs are stable around the rising edge of the clock to prevent metastability issues.\n                    "
