Module Specification for TopModule:

1. **Module Interface:**
   - **Inputs:**
     - `input wire d` - 1-bit input signal.
     - `input wire done_counting` - 1-bit input signal.
     - `input wire ack` - 1-bit input signal.
     - `input wire [9:0] state` - 10-bit one-hot encoded state vector.
   
   - **Outputs:**
     - `output wire B3_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is B3.
     - `output wire S_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is S.
     - `output wire S1_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is S1.
     - `output wire Count_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is Count.
     - `output wire Wait_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is Wait.
     - `output wire done` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the state machine is in the Wait state and `done` condition is met.
     - `output wire counting` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the state machine is in the Count state.
     - `output wire shift_ena` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the state machine is in states B0, B1, B2, or B3.

2. **State Machine Details:**
   - The state machine is a Moore type with 10 one-hot encoded states: S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, and Wait.
   - Each state is represented by a specific bit position in the `state` vector.
     - S: 10'b0000000001
     - S1: 10'b0000000010
     - S11: 10'b0000000100
     - S110: 10'b0000001000
     - B0: 10'b0000010000
     - B1: 10'b0000100000
     - B2: 10'b0001000000
     - B3: 10'b0010000000
     - Count: 10'b0100000000
     - Wait: 10'b1000000000

3. **State Transitions:**
   - On reset, the state machine starts in the state "S".
   - Transitions are based on inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack`:
     - S: 
       - `d=0` stays in S
       - `d=1` transitions to S1
     - S1: 
       - `d=0` transitions to S
       - `d=1` transitions to S11
     - S11: 
       - `d=0` transitions to S110
       - `d=1` stays in S11
     - S110: 
       - `d=0` transitions to S
       - `d=1` transitions to B0
     - B0: (always transitions to B1)
     - B1: (always transitions to B2)
     - B2: (always transitions to B3)
     - B3: (always transitions to Count)
     - Count: 
       - `done_counting=0` stays in Count
       - `done_counting=1` transitions to Wait
     - Wait: 
       - `ack=0` stays in Wait
       - `ack=1` transitions to S

4. **Output Logic:**
   - `B3_next`: Asserted when the next state is B3.
   - `S_next`: Asserted when the next state is S.
   - `S1_next`: Asserted when the next state is S1.
   - `Count_next`: Asserted when the next state is Count.
   - `Wait_next`: Asserted when the next state is Wait.
   - `done`: Asserted when the state is Wait.
   - `counting`: Asserted when the state is Count.
   - `shift_ena`: Asserted when the state is B0, B1, B2, or B3.

5. **Reset Behavior:**
   - Asynchronous reset initializes the state machine to state S.

6. **Signal Conventions:**
   - Bit indexing is defined such that `bit[0]` is the least significant bit.
   - All inputs are considered active high and output signals are asserted high when the respective conditions are met.
