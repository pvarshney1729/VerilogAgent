Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for TopModule:\n\n1. **Module Interface:**\n   - **Inputs:**\n     - `input wire d` - 1-bit input signal.\n     - `input wire done_counting` - 1-bit input signal.\n     - `input wire ack` - 1-bit input signal.\n     - `input wire [9:0] state` - 10-bit one-hot encoded state vector.\n   \n   - **Outputs:**\n     - `output wire B3_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is B3.\n     - `output wire S_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is S.\n     - `output wire S1_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is S1.\n     - `output wire Count_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is Count.\n     - `output wire Wait_next` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the next state is Wait.\n     - `output wire done` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the state machine is in the Wait state and `done` condition is met.\n     - `output wire counting` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the state machine is in the Count state.\n     - `output wire shift_ena` - 1-bit output signal; asserts high when the state machine is in states B0, B1, B2, or B3.\n\n2. **State Machine Details:**\n   - The state machine is a Moore type with 10 one-hot encoded states: S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, and Wait.\n   - Each state is represented by a specific bit position in the `state` vector.\n     - S: 10'b0000000001\n     - S1: 10'b0000000010\n     - S11: 10'b0000000100\n     - S110: 10'b0000001000\n     - B0: 10'b0000010000\n     - B1: 10'b0000100000\n     - B2: 10'b0001000000\n     - B3: 10'b0010000000\n     - Count: 10'b0100000000\n     - Wait: 10'b1000000000\n\n3. **State Transitions:**\n   - On reset, the state machine starts in the state \"S\".\n   - Transitions are based on inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack`:\n     - S: \n       - `d=0` stays in S\n       - `d=1` transitions to S1\n     - S1: \n       - `d=0` transitions to S\n       - `d=1` transitions to S11\n     - S11: \n       - `d=0` transitions to S110\n       - `d=1` stays in S11\n     - S110: \n       - `d=0` transitions to S\n       - `d=1` transitions to B0\n     - B0: (always transitions to B1)\n     - B1: (always transitions to B2)\n     - B2: (always transitions to B3)\n     - B3: (always transitions to Count)\n     - Count: \n       - `done_counting=0` stays in Count\n       - `done_counting=1` transitions to Wait\n     - Wait: \n       - `ack=0` stays in Wait\n       - `ack=1` transitions to S\n\n4. **Output Logic:**\n   - `B3_next`: Asserted when the next state is B3.\n   - `S_next`: Asserted when the next state is S.\n   - `S1_next`: Asserted when the next state is S1.\n   - `Count_next`: Asserted when the next state is Count.\n   - `Wait_next`: Asserted when the next state is Wait.\n   - `done`: Asserted when the state is Wait.\n   - `counting`: Asserted when the state is Count.\n   - `shift_ena`: Asserted when the state is B0, B1, B2, or B3.\n\n5. **Reset Behavior:**\n   - Asynchronous reset initializes the state machine to state S.\n\n6. **Signal Conventions:**\n   - Bit indexing is defined such that `bit[0]` is the least significant bit.\n   - All inputs are considered active high and output signals are asserted high when the respective conditions are met.\n                    "
