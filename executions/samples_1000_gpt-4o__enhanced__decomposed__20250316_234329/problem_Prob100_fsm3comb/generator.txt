<REASONING>
To implement the Verilog module for the given Moore state machine, we need to focus on the combinational logic that determines the next state and the output based on the current state and input. The state machine has four states (A, B, C, D) with specific transitions and outputs as defined in the state transition table.

1. **State Encoding**: We use 2-bit encoding for the states: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.

2. **Combinational Logic**: The logic for determining the next state and output is purely combinational. We will use an `always @(*)` block to describe this logic, which will be sensitive to changes in the current state and input.

3. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state, not the input.

4. **Guidelines and Conventions**: We will declare all ports and signals as `logic`, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

5. **No Synchronous Reset**: The specification does not mention a reset, so we will not include one.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the given specifications and coding conventions.
