Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: 
  - `in`: 1-bit, representing the input signal.
  - `state`: 2-bit, representing the current state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the Most Significant Bit (MSB), and bit[0] is the Least Significant Bit (LSB).
- Output: 
  - `next_state`: 2-bit, representing the next state of the state machine. Bit[1] is the MSB, and bit[0] is the LSB.
  - `out`: 1-bit, representing the output of the state machine.

State Encoding:
- State A: 2'b00
- State B: 2'b01
- State C: 2'b10
- State D: 2'b11

State Transition Logic (Combinational Logic):
- Current State A:
  - If `in` is 0, `next_state` = A (2'b00)
  - If `in` is 1, `next_state` = B (2'b01)
- Current State B:
  - If `in` is 0, `next_state` = C (2'b10)
  - If `in` is 1, `next_state` = B (2'b01)
- Current State C:
  - If `in` is 0, `next_state` = A (2'b00)
  - If `in` is 1, `next_state` = D (2'b11)
- Current State D:
  - If `in` is 0, `next_state` = C (2'b10)
  - If `in` is 1, `next_state` = B (2'b01)

Output Logic (Combinational Logic):
- For states A, B, and C, `out` = 0
- For state D, `out` = 1

Additional Considerations:
- The implementation is purely combinational; hence, no clocked or sequential elements are included.
- Ensure all logic expressions are minimized for optimal synthesis.
- Handle all possible input combinations explicitly to avoid undefined behavior.
