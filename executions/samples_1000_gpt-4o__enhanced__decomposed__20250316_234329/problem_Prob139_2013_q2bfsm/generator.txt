To implement the FSM as specified, we need to define states and transitions based on the conditions provided. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **State A**: Initial state where the FSM stays as long as `resetn` is asserted low. When `resetn` is de-asserted, the FSM transitions to State B on the next clock edge.

2. **State B**: In this state, the output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle. After this, the FSM transitions to State C.

3. **State C**: This state monitors the input `x` for the sequence 1, 0, 1 over three successive clock cycles. If the sequence is detected, the FSM transitions to State D.

4. **State D**: In this state, the output `g` is set to 1. The FSM then transitions to State E to monitor the input `y`.

5. **State E**: This state monitors the input `y` for two clock cycles. If `y` becomes 1 within these two cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently. If not, the FSM transitions to State F.

6. **State F**: In this state, `g` is set to 0 permanently until the next reset.

The FSM will use a synchronous reset, meaning that the reset signal is sampled with respect to the clock. The state transitions and output logic will be implemented using a combination of sequential and combinational logic.

The FSM will be implemented using an always block for the state transitions and another always block for the output logic. The state encoding will be done using localparam for clarity and maintainability.

The code will adhere to the provided coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.
