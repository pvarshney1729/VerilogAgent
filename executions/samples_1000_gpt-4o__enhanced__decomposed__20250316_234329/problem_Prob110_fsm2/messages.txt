Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal, driving all sequential logic.\n  - `input wire areset` : Active-high asynchronous reset signal. When high, forces the state machine to the OFF state.\n  - `input wire j` : Control input, used to transition from OFF to ON state.\n  - `input wire k` : Control input, used to transition from ON to OFF state.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg out` : Represents the current output of the state machine. Initialized to 0.\n\nDesign Specification:\n- State Machine Type: Moore State Machine\n- Number of States: 2\n  - OFF State: Output `out` is 0.\n  - ON State: Output `out` is 1.\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active-high.\n  - On assertion of `areset`, the state machine transitions to the OFF state, and `out` is set to 0.\n\n- State Transitions:\n  - When in the OFF state (`out=0`):\n    - If `j` is 0, remain in the OFF state.\n    - If `j` is 1, transition to the ON state.\n  - When in the ON state (`out=1`):\n    - If `k` is 0, remain in the ON state.\n    - If `k` is 1, transition to the OFF state.\n\n- Bit Indexing: \n  - All signals are single-bit, no additional indexing is required.\n\n- Initialization:\n  - The state machine should initialize in the OFF state with `out` set to 0 on reset assertion.\n\n- Edge Cases:\n  - Ensure that on the rising edge of `clk`, the state transitions occur as per the state logic described given the current values of `j` and `k`.\n  - Handle asynchronous reset (`areset`) such that it takes precedence over clock-driven state transitions.\n  \n- Precedence:\n  - Asynchronous reset has the highest precedence and can override any state transition dictated by `j` or `k`.\n\nNote: Ensure that all transitions and outputs are updated synchronously with the clock edge except for the asynchronous reset.\n                    "
