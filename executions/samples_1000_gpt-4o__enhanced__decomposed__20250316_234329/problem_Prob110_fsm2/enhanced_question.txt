Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal, driving all sequential logic.
  - `input wire areset` : Active-high asynchronous reset signal. When high, forces the state machine to the OFF state.
  - `input wire j` : Control input, used to transition from OFF to ON state.
  - `input wire k` : Control input, used to transition from ON to OFF state.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `output reg out` : Represents the current output of the state machine. Initialized to 0.

Design Specification:
- State Machine Type: Moore State Machine
- Number of States: 2
  - OFF State: Output `out` is 0.
  - ON State: Output `out` is 1.

- Reset Behavior:
  - The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active-high.
  - On assertion of `areset`, the state machine transitions to the OFF state, and `out` is set to 0.

- State Transitions:
  - When in the OFF state (`out=0`):
    - If `j` is 0, remain in the OFF state.
    - If `j` is 1, transition to the ON state.
  - When in the ON state (`out=1`):
    - If `k` is 0, remain in the ON state.
    - If `k` is 1, transition to the OFF state.

- Bit Indexing: 
  - All signals are single-bit, no additional indexing is required.

- Initialization:
  - The state machine should initialize in the OFF state with `out` set to 0 on reset assertion.

- Edge Cases:
  - Ensure that on the rising edge of `clk`, the state transitions occur as per the state logic described given the current values of `j` and `k`.
  - Handle asynchronous reset (`areset`) such that it takes precedence over clock-driven state transitions.
  
- Precedence:
  - Asynchronous reset has the highest precedence and can override any state transition dictated by `j` or `k`.

Note: Ensure that all transitions and outputs are updated synchronously with the clock edge except for the asynchronous reset.
