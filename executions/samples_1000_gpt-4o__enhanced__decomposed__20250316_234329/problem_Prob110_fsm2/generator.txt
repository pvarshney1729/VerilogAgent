To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we will follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. All ports will be declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **State Encoding**: Use `localparam` to define the two states, `OFF` and `ON`, with binary values. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **State Register**: Implement a state register to hold the current state of the machine. This register will be updated on the rising edge of the clock or asynchronously reset to `OFF` when `areset` is high.

4. **Next State Logic**: Use combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and the inputs `j` and `k`. This will be done using an `always @(*)` block.

5. **Output Logic**: Since this is a Moore machine, the output `out` depends only on the current state. Implement this logic using another `always @(*)` block.

6. **Asynchronous Reset**: Ensure that the asynchronous reset (`areset`) takes precedence over the clock-driven state transitions.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions provided.
