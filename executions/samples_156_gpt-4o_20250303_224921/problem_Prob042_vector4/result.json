The most significant bit (MSB) of the \n    // input is replicated 24 times to preserve the signed value in the extended \n    // form. This is useful for operations that require larger bit-widths while \n    // maintaining the sign of the original number.\n\n    // Implementation:\n    // The output is formed by concatenating 24 copies of the sign bit (in[7]) \n    // followed by the original 8-bit input.\n    assign out = {{24{in[7]}}, in};\n\n    // Notes:\n    // - This implementation assumes the input is a signed 8-bit number and the \n    //   output is a signed 32-bit number.\n    // - The module is purely combinational and does not require any clock or reset.\n    // - Bit indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and bit[7] \n    //   refers to the most significant bit (MSB) of the input `in`.\n\nendmodule",
