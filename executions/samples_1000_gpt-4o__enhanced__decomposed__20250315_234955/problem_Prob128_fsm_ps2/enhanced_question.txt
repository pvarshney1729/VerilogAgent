Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.
  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset. On reset, all registers and state elements are initialized.
  - `in`: 8-bit input data stream. Bit indexing follows [7:0] convention, where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB).

- Outputs:
  - `done`: 1-bit signal that indicates the successful receipt of a complete three-byte message. This signal is asserted high for one clock cycle following the reception of the third byte.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify the boundaries of messages in a continuous 8-bit byte stream, adhering to the PS/2 mouse protocol.
- Message Identification:
  - The first byte of each message is identified by `in[3]` being set to `1`.
  - Subsequent bytes (the second and third) may have `in[3]` set to either `1` or `0`.
- The FSM discards bytes until a byte with `in[3] = 1` is detected, indicating the start of a new message.
- Once the first byte is detected, the FSM counts the subsequent two bytes, completing the message upon receiving the third byte.
- The `done` output is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte of a message is successfully received.

Reset Behavior:
- On receiving a synchronous active-high reset signal (`reset = 1`), the FSM and all registers are reset to a known initial state, ready to begin processing a new byte stream.
- The reset initializes the FSM to a state where it waits for the first byte of a new message (`in[3] = 1`).

Clock and Timing:
- All sequential elements, including the FSM states and any counters, are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- The FSM transitions and output signals are updated based on the clock edge, ensuring predictable and synchronized behavior.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- If no message start (`in[3] = 1`) is detected, the FSM remains in its initial state, discarding bytes until the condition is met.
- Any bytes following the third byte of a completed message are considered out-of-scope until a new message start is detected.
- The FSM handles continuous streams without explicit delimiters by strictly adhering to the message start condition (`in[3] = 1`).

This refined specification ensures clarity in the design and implementation of the FSM logic within the `TopModule`, aligning with the PS/2 mouse protocol requirements.
