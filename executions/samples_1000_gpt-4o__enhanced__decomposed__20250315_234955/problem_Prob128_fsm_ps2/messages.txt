        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. The module operates on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit synchronous active-high reset. On reset, all registers and state elements are initialized.\n  - `in`: 8-bit input data stream. Bit indexing follows [7:0] convention, where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `done`: 1-bit signal that indicates the successful receipt of a complete three-byte message. This signal is asserted high for one clock cycle following the reception of the third byte.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify the boundaries of messages in a continuous 8-bit byte stream, adhering to the PS/2 mouse protocol.\n- Message Identification:\n  - The first byte of each message is identified by `in[3]` being set to `1`.\n  - Subsequent bytes (the second and third) may have `in[3]` set to either `1` or `0`.\n- The FSM discards bytes until a byte with `in[3] = 1` is detected, indicating the start of a new message.\n- Once the first byte is detected, the FSM counts the subsequent two bytes, completing the message upon receiving the third byte.\n- The `done` output is asserted high for one clock cycle immediately after the third byte of a message is successfully received.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On receiving a synchronous active-high reset signal (`reset = 1`), the FSM and all registers are reset to a known initial state, ready to begin processing a new byte stream.\n- The reset initializes the FSM to a state where it waits for the first byte of a new message (`in[3] = 1`).\n\nClock and Timing:\n- All sequential elements, including the FSM states and any counters, are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The FSM transitions and output signals are updated based on the clock edge, ensuring predictable and synchronized behavior.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- If no message start (`in[3] = 1`) is detected, the FSM remains in its initial state, discarding bytes until the condition is met.\n- Any bytes following the third byte of a completed message are considered out-of-scope until a new message start is detected.\n- The FSM handles continuous streams without explicit delimiters by strictly adhering to the message start condition (`in[3] = 1`).\n\nThis refined specification ensures clarity in the design and implementation of the FSM logic within the `TopModule`, aligning with the PS/2 mouse protocol requirements.\n                    "
