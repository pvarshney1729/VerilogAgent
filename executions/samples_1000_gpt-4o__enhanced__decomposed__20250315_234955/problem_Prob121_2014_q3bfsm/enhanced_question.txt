Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- input wire clk; // Clock signal, triggering events on the positive edge.
- input wire reset; // Synchronous active-high reset signal.
- input wire x; // Input signal affecting state transitions.
- output reg z; // Output signal determined by the current state.

State Encoding:
- Present State Register: y[2:0] (3-bit wide, unsigned)
  - y[2] is the most significant bit (MSB).
  - y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Reset Behavior:
- Synchronous with the clock.
- On reset (reset == 1), the state is initialized to y = 3'b000.

Clock Behavior:
- All sequential logic transitions occur on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.

Finite State Machine (FSM):
- State Transitions and Output Logic:
  1. Present State: 000
     - Next State if x = 0: 000
     - Next State if x = 1: 001
     - Output z: 0

  2. Present State: 001
     - Next State if x = 0: 001
     - Next State if x = 1: 100
     - Output z: 0

  3. Present State: 010
     - Next State if x = 0: 010
     - Next State if x = 1: 001
     - Output z: 0

  4. Present State: 011
     - Next State if x = 0: 001
     - Next State if x = 1: 010
     - Output z: 1

  5. Present State: 100
     - Next State if x = 0: 011
     - Next State if x = 1: 100
     - Output z: 1

General Notes:
- Ensure state transitions and output logic are implemented combinatorially based on the present state and input 'x'.
- There are no undefined states or behavior for the specified state transitions and input combinations.
- Edge cases involving reset and clock signal transitions must be handled to prevent race conditions.
