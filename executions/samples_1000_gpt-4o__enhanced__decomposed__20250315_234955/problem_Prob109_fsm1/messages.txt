Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit input; serves as the clock signal for the sequential logic.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit input; serves as an asynchronous reset signal.\n  - `in`: 1-bit input; serves as the machine's input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output; represents the output of the Moore machine.\n\nOperation:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states, A and B.\n- State Encoding:\n  - State A: Outputs `out = 0`.\n  - State B: Outputs `out = 1`.\n\nState Transition Diagram:\n- From State B:\n  - On `in = 0`: Transition to State A.\n  - On `in = 1`: Remain in State B.\n  \n- From State A:\n  - On `in = 0`: Transition to State B.\n  - On `in = 1`: Remain in State A.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module should asynchronously reset to State B when `areset` is high.\n- `areset` has priority over other state transitions.\n\nAdditional Specifications:\n- Bit Indexing: The module uses 1-bit signals (no indexing required).\n- The reset initializes the state to B, producing an output of 1.\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- Ensure there are no race conditions by assuming zero setup and hold time for the `clk` signal relative to `areset` and `in`.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- The module handles changes in `in` on any clock edge, but transitions occur only on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- Ensure the state machine remains deterministic and consistent across all input variations.\n\nNote: Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have defined behavior for both reset and normal operational conditions.\n                    "
