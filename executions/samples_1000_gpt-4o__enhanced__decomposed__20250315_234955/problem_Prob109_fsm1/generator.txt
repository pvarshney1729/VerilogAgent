<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The machine should asynchronously reset to state B when `areset` is high. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state: it is `1` in state B and `0` in state A.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a 1-bit signal to represent the states, where `0` represents state A and `1` represents state B.

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset logic will ensure that the state transitions to B whenever `areset` is high, regardless of the clock.

3. **State Transition Logic**: We will use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output is directly tied to the state, so it will be set to `1` if the current state is B and `0` if the current state is A.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the always block for the state transition will use `always @(*)` to infer the sensitivity list automatically.

6. **Sequential Logic**: The state register will be updated on the rising edge of `clk`, with the asynchronous reset taking precedence.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specified behavior and coding conventions.
