Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit input; serves as the clock signal for the sequential logic.
  - `areset`: 1-bit input; serves as an asynchronous reset signal.
  - `in`: 1-bit input; serves as the machine's input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output; represents the output of the Moore machine.

Operation:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states, A and B.
- State Encoding:
  - State A: Outputs `out = 0`.
  - State B: Outputs `out = 1`.

State Transition Diagram:
- From State B:
  - On `in = 0`: Transition to State A.
  - On `in = 1`: Remain in State B.
  
- From State A:
  - On `in = 0`: Transition to State B.
  - On `in = 1`: Remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- The module should asynchronously reset to State B when `areset` is high.
- `areset` has priority over other state transitions.

Additional Specifications:
- Bit Indexing: The module uses 1-bit signals (no indexing required).
- The reset initializes the state to B, producing an output of 1.
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
- Ensure there are no race conditions by assuming zero setup and hold time for the `clk` signal relative to `areset` and `in`.

Boundary Conditions:
- The module handles changes in `in` on any clock edge, but transitions occur only on the rising edge of `clk`.
- Ensure the state machine remains deterministic and consistent across all input variations.

Note: Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have defined behavior for both reset and normal operational conditions.
