<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we will design a finite state machine (FSM) to handle the serial communication protocol described. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0). The line is idle at logic 1.
2. **START**: Upon detecting a start bit, the FSM transitions to this state to confirm the start of data reception.
3. **DATA**: The FSM shifts in 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit (LSB).
4. **STOP**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (logic 1).
5. **DONE**: If the stop bit is correct, the FSM asserts `done` and outputs the received byte.

The FSM will transition between these states based on the input bit stream and the current state. The `out_byte` will be valid when `done` is asserted. The synchronous reset will initialize the FSM to the IDLE state and clear any registers.

We will use a 3-bit counter to keep track of the number of data bits received. The FSM will be implemented using an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The reset logic will be synchronous, meaning it will be sampled with the clock.

The module will adhere to the specified interface and coding conventions, using `logic` for all ports and signals, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.
