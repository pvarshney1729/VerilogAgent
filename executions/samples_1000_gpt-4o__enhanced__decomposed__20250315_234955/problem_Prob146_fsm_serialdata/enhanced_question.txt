<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- `input in`: Serial input data stream.
- `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- `output reg [7:0] out_byte`: 8-bit output representing the correctly received data byte.
- `output reg done`: Indicates the successful reception of a complete byte, including start and stop bits.

The module will operate as follows:

1. **Idle State**: The line is at logic high (1) when idle. The FSM should remain in this state until a start bit is detected.

2. **Start Bit Detection**: The FSM transitions from the idle state upon detection of a start bit (logic 0).

3. **Data Bit Reception**: After the start bit, the FSM will sequentially shift in 8 data bits. The serial protocol sends bits starting with the least significant bit (LSB), meaning bit[0] is received first.

4. **Stop Bit Verification**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM expects a stop bit (logic 1). If the stop bit is correct, the FSM will:
   - Assert `done` high for one clock cycle.
   - Load the received 8-bit data into `out_byte`.
   
5. **Error Handling**: If a stop bit is not detected, the FSM will wait for a stop bit before resetting to the idle state and attempting to receive the next byte.

6. **Reset Behavior**: On asserting `reset` high, the FSM will initialize to the idle state, `out_byte` is set to a don't-care state unless `done` is asserted, and `done` is set to low. 

7. **Clock Cycle Relationships**: All transitions and data capturing occur on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring synchronization with the input data stream.

This design ensures correct byte reception by adhering to the start bit (0), 8 data bits, and stop bit (1) protocol, with all outputs and state transitions clearly defined.
