To implement the FSM described in the specification, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the States**: We have four states: A, B, C, and D. We'll use a 2-bit encoding for these states.

2. **State Transition Logic**: 
   - From State A, transition to:
     - State B if `r[0]` is high.
     - State C if `r[1]` is high and `r[0]` is low.
     - State D if `r[2]` is high and both `r[0]` and `r[1]` are low.
     - Remain in State A if all requests are low.
   - From State B, remain in State B if `r[0]` is high, otherwise transition to State A.
   - From State C, remain in State C if `r[1]` is high, otherwise transition to State A.
   - State D is not explicitly defined in the transitions, so it will transition back to State A.

3. **Output Logic**: 
   - In State B, set `g[0]` high.
   - In State C, set `g[1]` high.
   - In State D, set `g[2]` high.
   - In State A, all grants are low.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement an active-low synchronous reset to initialize the FSM to State A.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and follow the guidelines for always blocks and sensitivity lists.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the FSM behaves according to the specification and handles the priority of requests correctly.
