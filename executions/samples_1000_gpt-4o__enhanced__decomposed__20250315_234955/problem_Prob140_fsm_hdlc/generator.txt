<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to design a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) that can recognize specific bit patterns in a serial data stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Initial state, waiting for the start of a sequence.
2. **S1 to S6**: Intermediate states to track consecutive '1's.
3. **DISCARD**: State to signal a bit needs to be discarded after detecting "0111110".
4. **FLAG**: State to signal a frame boundary after detecting "01111110".
5. **ERROR**: State to signal an error after detecting "01111111".

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input bit stream. The outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) are asserted for one clock cycle after the respective sequence is detected. The FSM resets to the IDLE state synchronously with the clock when the reset signal is high.

The implementation will use a synchronous reset and will follow the coding conventions provided, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring correct sensitivity lists for combinational logic.
