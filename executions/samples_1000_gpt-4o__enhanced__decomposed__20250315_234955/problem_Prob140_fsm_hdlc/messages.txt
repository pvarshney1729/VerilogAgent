        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. The module operates on the positive edge.\n  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n  - in: 1-bit serial data input.\n- Output Ports:\n  - disc: 1-bit output. Asserted for one clock cycle to indicate a bit should be discarded.\n  - flag: 1-bit output. Asserted for one clock cycle to indicate a frame boundary (start or end of a frame).\n  - err: 1-bit output. Asserted for one clock cycle to indicate an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.\n\nBehavioral Description:\n- The module implements a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to process a continuous serial bit stream.\n- The FSM should recognize the following sequences:\n  1. Sequence \"0111110\": After detecting this sequence, assert the 'disc' output signal for one clock cycle immediately following the detection.\n  2. Sequence \"01111110\": After detecting this sequence, assert the 'flag' output signal for one clock cycle immediately following the detection.\n  3. Sequence \"01111111...\": After detecting seven or more consecutive '1's, assert the 'err' output signal for one clock cycle immediately following the detection.\n\nState and Reset Conditions:\n- The FSM should initialize to a state equivalent to having just processed an input '0' after reset.\n- The reset is active-high and synchronous with the clock, meaning that the reset state is entered on the next positive clock edge when the reset signal is high.\n\nInputs and Outputs:\n- Each output (disc, flag, err) is asserted for exactly one clock cycle following the recognition of its respective sequence.\n- The module should correctly handle edge cases where sequences overlap and ensure no race conditions occur by prioritizing sequences in the order given above (disc, flag, err).\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- Bit indexing: The least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0].\n- The FSM should handle transitions efficiently and prevent incorrect sequence recognition due to incomplete or overlapping sequences.\n\nNote: Ensure all state transitions and outputs are defined according to the detected sequence and handle potential overlaps logically.\n                    "
