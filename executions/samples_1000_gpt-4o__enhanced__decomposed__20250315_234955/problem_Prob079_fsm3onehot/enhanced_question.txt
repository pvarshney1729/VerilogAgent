Module Specification for TopModule:

- Module Name: TopModule

- Port Definitions:
  - Input:
    - `input in`: A single-bit input signal.
    - `input [3:0] state`: A 4-bit input representing the current state in a one-hot encoded format.
  - Output:
    - `output [3:0] next_state`: A 4-bit output representing the next state in a one-hot encoded format.
    - `output out`: A single-bit output signal.

- State Encoding:
  - State A: 4'b0001
  - State B: 4'b0010
  - State C: 4'b0100
  - State D: 4'b1000

- State Transition and Output Logic:
  - The state machine is a Moore type, meaning the output depends only on the current state.
  - Transitions are defined as follows:
    - State A:
      - If `in` is 0, the next state is A.
      - If `in` is 1, the next state is B.
    - State B:
      - If `in` is 0, the next state is C.
      - If `in` is 1, the next state is B.
    - State C:
      - If `in` is 0, the next state is A.
      - If `in` is 1, the next state is D.
    - State D:
      - If `in` is 0, the next state is C.
      - If `in` is 1, the next state is B.
  - Output Logic:
    - For states A, B, and C, the output is 0.
    - For state D, the output is 1.

- Implementation Notes:
  - This module should implement the combinational logic for state transitions and output determination.
  - All state transitions and outputs should be derived using the provided state transition table.
  - The implementation should correctly interpret one-hot encoded state inputs and produce the appropriate one-hot encoded next state and output.
  - Ensure that all combinational logic paths are fully specified to avoid any undefined behavior.

- Edge Cases:
  - The design assumes that only valid one-hot encoded states are provided at the `state` input.
  - Inputs outside the defined state encoding are not specified within this module and should be handled externally or lead to an undefined behavior.
