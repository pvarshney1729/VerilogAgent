        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal, 1-bit, triggering all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire reset` : Reset signal, 1-bit, active high, synchronous. It initializes the FSM to the reset state A.\n  - `input wire s` : Control signal, 1-bit, used to transition from state A to state B.\n  - `input wire w` : Data signal, 1-bit, examined during state B.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg z` : Output signal, 1-bit, set based on the conditions of state B.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n1. Initial State: \n   - The FSM begins in the reset state A on reset assertion.\n   - In state A, the FSM remains unless `s = 1`, which triggers a transition to state B on the next positive clock edge.\n\n2. State Transitions:\n   - State A:\n     - The FSM remains in state A as long as `s = 0`.\n     - Transition to state B occurs when `s = 1` is detected on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n   - State B:\n     - Upon entering state B, the FSM monitors the `w` input over three consecutive clock cycles.\n     - A counter tracks the number of cycles where `w = 1`.\n     - After three cycles, if `w` has been `1` for exactly two of these cycles, `z` is set to `1` for the next clock cycle.\n     - Otherwise, `z` is set to `0`.\n     - The FSM continues to cycle through state B, repeating the three-cycle monitoring of `w`.\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n   - On the assertion of `reset`, the FSM returns to state A, `z` is reset to `0`, and all internal counters are cleared.\n   - The reset is synchronous: the state transition and output `z` update occur on the next rising edge of `clk` following reset assertion.\n\n4. Signal Conventions:\n   - All bit indices follow the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n   - The FSM uses as few states as possible, focusing on the described functionality.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n   - Ensure that `w` is correctly counted only during the specified three-clock cycle windows in state B.\n   - Handle potential race conditions by ensuring all state transitions and output updates are synchronized with `clk`.\n\nThis specification ensures that the FSM operates correctly under the defined conditions and provides a clear guide for implementation.\n                    "
