        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. The interface and behavior requirements are as follows:\n\n### Port Definitions\n- **Input Ports:**\n  - `clk`: A single-bit input serving as the clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `reset`: A single-bit input for reset, active high. The reset is synchronous with the clock.\n\n- **Output Ports:**\n  - `q`: A 32-bit wide output representing the current state of the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n\n### LFSR Specifications\n- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- The Galois LFSR architecture shifts bits to the right on each clock cycle.\n- The feedback taps are at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0 (using zero-based indexing, where `q[0]` is the least significant bit).\n- The new value for each tapped bit position is determined by XORing its current value with the value of `q[0]`.\n- Bit positions not tapped simply shift right, taking the value of their left neighbor.\n\n### Reset Behavior\n- The reset signal (`reset`) is active high and synchronous, meaning it will only take effect on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- Upon assertion of reset, the output `q` is initialized to the value `32'h1`.\n\n### Sequential Logic\n- The shift and feedback operations occur on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n- The reset condition takes precedence over normal operation, ensuring `q` is set to `32'h1` when `reset` is high on a clock edge.\n\n### Edge Cases and Special Conditions\n- Ensure that the LFSR never enters a state of all zeros. This is inherently avoided by the reset value of `32'h1`.\n- The LFSR operates under the assumption that the clock is free from glitches and has a consistent duty cycle.\n\nThis specification provides the necessary details to implement the `TopModule` with the described functionality and behavior.\n                    "
