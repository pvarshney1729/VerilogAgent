<REASONING>
To implement the 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is `q`, which is a 32-bit wide signal.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset mechanism. When `reset` is high on the rising edge of `clk`, the output `q` should be set to `32'h1`.

3. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the Galois LFSR logic. The LFSR shifts right, and the new value for each tapped bit position is determined by XORing its current value with the least significant bit `q[0]`. The taps are at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0 (zero-based indexing).

4. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to implement the sequential logic. The reset condition should take precedence over the LFSR operation.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the provided coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

By following these steps, we can ensure the module meets the specified requirements and behaves correctly.
