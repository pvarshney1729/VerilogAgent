<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions depend on the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output is determined solely by the current state. The reset is synchronous, meaning it will only affect the state on the rising edge of the clock. The output `out` is set to 0 in the OFF state and 1 in the ON state. We'll use a localparam to define the state encoding, and a combination of always blocks to handle state transitions and output logic. The coding conventions specify using `logic` for all signals and using `always @(*)` for combinational logic.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    input logic j,
    input logic k,
    output logic out
);

    // State encoding
    localparam logic OFF = 1'b0;
    localparam logic ON  = 1'b1;

    logic state, next_state;

    // State transition logic with synchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= OFF;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            OFF: begin
                if (j)
                    next_state = ON;
                else
                    next_state = OFF;
            end
            ON: begin
                if (k)
