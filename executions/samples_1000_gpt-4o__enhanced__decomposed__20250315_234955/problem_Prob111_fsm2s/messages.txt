Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit wide unless otherwise specified. Signal naming follows a lower-case convention for inputs and outputs.\n\n- `input clk`: Clock signal, active on the rising edge.\n- `input reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n- `input j`: Input signal for state transition when in the OFF state.\n- `input k`: Input signal for state transition when in the ON state.\n- `output reg out`: Output signal representing the current state output.\n\nThis module implements a Moore state machine with two states, OFF and ON, each associated with a specific output value. The machine transitions between states based on inputs `j` and `k`. The reset operation is a synchronous active-high reset, which initializes the state machine to the OFF state with `out` set to 0.\n\nState Description and Transition Table:\n- State OFF (out = 0):\n  - If `j = 0`, remain in state OFF.\n  - If `j = 1`, transition to state ON.\n- State ON (out = 1):\n  - If `k = 0`, remain in state ON.\n  - If `k = 1`, transition to state OFF.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On reset (`reset = 1`), the state machine enters the OFF state, and `out` is set to 0. This reset behavior is synchronous to the clock.\n\nClock and Reset:\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The reset is synchronous, affecting the state machine at the next rising clock edge when `reset` is high.\n\nEnsure that any state transition logic and output assignments are updated only on the positive edge of the clock, respecting the synchronous reset condition.\n                    "
