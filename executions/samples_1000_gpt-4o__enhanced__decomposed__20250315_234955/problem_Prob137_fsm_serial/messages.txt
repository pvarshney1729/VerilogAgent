Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal for sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.\n  - reset: 1-bit, active-high, synchronous reset signal.\n  - in: 1-bit, serial data input stream.\n- Output Ports:\n  - done: 1-bit, indicates successful reception of a byte, active high.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. Serial Communication Protocol:\n   - The protocol utilizes a start bit (0), followed by 8 data bits, and concludes with a stop bit (1).\n   - The line remains at logic level 1 when idle.\n   - Data transmission is least significant bit (LSB) first.\n\n2. Finite State Machine (FSM) Requirements:\n   - The FSM should detect a start bit (0) to begin byte reception.\n   - After detecting the start bit, the FSM must collect the subsequent 8 data bits.\n   - After collecting 8 data bits, the FSM should check for the presence of a stop bit (1).\n   - If a stop bit is not detected where expected, the FSM should remain in a wait state until a valid stop bit is encountered before attempting to receive the next byte.\n\n3. Reset Behavior:\n   - The active-high synchronous reset should initialize all state registers to their default values.\n   - On reset assertion, the FSM should return to its idle state, ready to detect the next start bit.\n\n4. Clock and Timing:\n   - All sequential logic, including flip-flops and state transitions, should occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\n5. Signal Conventions:\n   - In all descriptions, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit of any multi-bit signal.\n   - Ensure all state transitions and data capture operations are free of race conditions and correctly synchronized with the edge of the clk signal.\n\n6. Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n   - The FSM should handle continuous high and low input streams and correctly reset to the idle state upon reception of a valid stop bit after an erroneous sequence.\n   - Ensure that any unexpected or erroneous input sequences do not result in undefined states or signals.\n\n7. Initial Values:\n   - Define initial states and values for all registers and flip-flops on reset assertion.\n\nThe design must comply with these specifications to ensure reliable operation within the defined serial communication protocol.\n                    "
