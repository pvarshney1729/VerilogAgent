Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal for sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.
  - reset: 1-bit, active-high, synchronous reset signal.
  - in: 1-bit, serial data input stream.
- Output Ports:
  - done: 1-bit, indicates successful reception of a byte, active high.

Specifications:
1. Serial Communication Protocol:
   - The protocol utilizes a start bit (0), followed by 8 data bits, and concludes with a stop bit (1).
   - The line remains at logic level 1 when idle.
   - Data transmission is least significant bit (LSB) first.

2. Finite State Machine (FSM) Requirements:
   - The FSM should detect a start bit (0) to begin byte reception.
   - After detecting the start bit, the FSM must collect the subsequent 8 data bits.
   - After collecting 8 data bits, the FSM should check for the presence of a stop bit (1).
   - If a stop bit is not detected where expected, the FSM should remain in a wait state until a valid stop bit is encountered before attempting to receive the next byte.

3. Reset Behavior:
   - The active-high synchronous reset should initialize all state registers to their default values.
   - On reset assertion, the FSM should return to its idle state, ready to detect the next start bit.

4. Clock and Timing:
   - All sequential logic, including flip-flops and state transitions, should occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.

5. Signal Conventions:
   - In all descriptions, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit of any multi-bit signal.
   - Ensure all state transitions and data capture operations are free of race conditions and correctly synchronized with the edge of the clk signal.

6. Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
   - The FSM should handle continuous high and low input streams and correctly reset to the idle state upon reception of a valid stop bit after an erroneous sequence.
   - Ensure that any unexpected or erroneous input sequences do not result in undefined states or signals.

7. Initial Values:
   - Define initial states and values for all registers and flip-flops on reset assertion.

The design must comply with these specifications to ensure reliable operation within the defined serial communication protocol.
