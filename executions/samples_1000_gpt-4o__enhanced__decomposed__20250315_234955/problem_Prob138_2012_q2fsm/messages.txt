Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and should adhere to the following interface specifications. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- Input: `clk` (Clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n- Input: `reset` (Synchronous active-high reset)\n- Input: `w` (Input signal to control state transitions)\n- Output: `z` (Output signal representing the FSM's output)\n\nThe state machine is defined with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The FSM transitions and outputs are as follows:\n\n- State A (output z = 0):\n  - On `w = 1`: Transition to state B\n  - On `w = 0`: Remain in state A\n- State B (output z = 0):\n  - On `w = 1`: Transition to state C\n  - On `w = 0`: Transition to state D\n- State C (output z = 0):\n  - On `w = 1`: Transition to state E\n  - On `w = 0`: Transition to state D\n- State D (output z = 0):\n  - On `w = 1`: Transition to state F\n  - On `w = 0`: Transition to state A\n- State E (output z = 1):\n  - On `w = 1`: Remain in state E\n  - On `w = 0`: Transition to state D\n- State F (output z = 1):\n  - On `w = 1`: Transition to state C\n  - On `w = 0`: Transition to state D\n\nUpon activation of the synchronous reset (reset = 1), the FSM should transition to state A on the next positive edge of the clock. The initial state on reset is A, with `z = 0`.\n\n- State encoding should be explicitly defined with unique binary codes for each state.\n- The FSM should be implemented using separate `always` blocks for state transition logic and state register (flip-flop) logic.\n- The output `z` should be generated using either a continuous assignment or an `always` block, ensuring that it correctly reflects the current state's output as defined above.\n\nBit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEnsure all sequential elements (state registers) have defined initial values as per the reset condition. Proper precedence of operations and signal dependencies must be maintained to prevent race conditions.\n                    "
