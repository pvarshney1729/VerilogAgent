Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\n**Port Definitions:**\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire d` : Single-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire done_counting` : Single-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire ack` : Single-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire [9:0] state` : 10-bit input representing the current state using one-hot encoding.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire B3_next` : Single-bit output, asserted when the next state is B3.\n  - `output wire S_next` : Single-bit output, asserted when the next state is S.\n  - `output wire S1_next` : Single-bit output, asserted when the next state is S1.\n  - `output wire Count_next` : Single-bit output, asserted when the next state is Count.\n  - `output wire Wait_next` : Single-bit output, asserted when the next state is Wait.\n  - `output wire done` : Single-bit output, indicates completion of a cycle.\n  - `output wire counting` : Single-bit output, indicates counting is in progress.\n  - `output wire shift_ena` : Single-bit output, enables shift operation in states B0, B1, B2, and B3.\n\n**State Machine Description:**\n- This is a Moore state machine with three inputs (`d`, `done_counting`, `ack`) and three main outputs (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`).\n- The state machine uses one-hot encoding for state representation:\n  - `S` = 10'b0000000001\n  - `S1` = 10'b0000000010\n  - `S11` = 10'b0000000100\n  - `S110` = 10'b0000001000\n  - `B0` = 10'b0000010000\n  - `B1` = 10'b0000100000\n  - `B2` = 10'b0001000000\n  - `B3` = 10'b0010000000\n  - `Count` = 10'b0100000000\n  - `Wait` = 10'b1000000000\n\n**State Transitions and Output Logic:**\n- Initial State: On reset (assumed synchronous), the state machine starts in state `S`.\n- State Transitions:\n  - `S` transitions to `S` if `d=0`, to `S1` if `d=1`.\n  - `S1` transitions to `S` if `d=0`, to `S11` if `d=1`.\n  - `S11` transitions to `S110` if `d=0`, remains in `S11` if `d=1`.\n  - `S110` transitions to `S` if `d=0`, to `B0` if `d=1`.\n  - `B0` transitions to `B1`, `B1` transitions to `B2`, `B2` transitions to `B3`, and `B3` transitions to `Count` sequentially.\n  - `Count` remains in `Count` if `done_counting=0`, transitions to `Wait` if `done_counting=1`.\n  - `Wait` remains in `Wait` if `ack=0`, transitions to `S` if `ack=1`.\n\n- Output Logic:\n  - `shift_ena` is asserted (1) in states `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, and `B3`.\n  - `counting` is asserted (1) in state `Count`.\n  - `done` is asserted (1) in state `Wait`.\n\n**Signal Logic Equations:**\n- Derive next state and output logic equations based on the above transitions and one-hot encoding.\n- Ensure no race conditions by carefully managing the state transitions, especially between sequential states like `B0` to `B1`.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- All flip-flops and registers are assumed to initialize to their respective states upon a synchronous reset.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n                    "
