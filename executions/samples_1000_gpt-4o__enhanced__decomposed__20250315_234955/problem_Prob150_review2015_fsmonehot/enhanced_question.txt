**State Machine Description:**
- This is a Moore state machine with three inputs (`d`, `done_counting`, `ack`) and three main outputs (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`).
- The state machine uses one-hot encoding for state representation:
  - `S` = 10'b0000000001
  - `S1` = 10'b0000000010
  - `S11` = 10'b0000000100
  - `S110` = 10'b0000001000
  - `B0` = 10'b0000010000
  - `B1` = 10'b0000100000
  - `B2` = 10'b0001000000
  - `B3` = 10'b0010000000
  - `Count` = 10'b0100000000
  - `Wait` = 10'b1000000000

**State Transitions and Output Logic:**
- Initial State: On reset (assumed synchronous), the state machine starts in state `S`.
- State Transitions:
  - `S` transitions to `S` if `d=0`, to `S1` if `d=1`.
  - `S1` transitions to `S` if `d=0`, to `S11` if `d=1`.
  - `S11` transitions to `S110` if `d=0`, remains in `S11` if `d=1`.
  - `S110` transitions to `S` if `d=0`, to `B0` if `d=1`.
  - `B0` transitions to `B1`, `B1` transitions to `B2`, `B2` transitions to `B3`, and `B3` transitions to `Count` sequentially.
  - `Count` remains in `Count` if `done_counting=0`, transitions to `Wait` if `done_counting=1`.
  - `Wait` remains in `Wait` if `ack=0`, transitions to `S` if `ack=1`.

- Output Logic:
  - `shift_ena` is asserted (1) in states `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, and `B3`.
  - `counting` is asserted (1) in state `Count`.
  - `done` is asserted (1) in state `Wait`.

**Signal Logic Equations:**
- Derive next state and output logic equations based on the above transitions and one-hot encoding.
- Ensure no race conditions by carefully managing the state transitions, especially between sequential states like `B0` to `B1`.

**Additional Notes:**
- All flip-flops and registers are assumed to initialize to their respective states upon a synchronous reset.
- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
