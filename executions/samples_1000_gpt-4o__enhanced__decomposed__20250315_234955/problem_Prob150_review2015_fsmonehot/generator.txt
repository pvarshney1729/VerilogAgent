<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a Verilog module that handles the state transitions and output logic for a Moore state machine using one-hot encoding. The state machine has 10 states, each represented by a single bit in a 10-bit vector. The transitions between states are determined by the inputs `d`, `done_counting`, and `ack`. The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are asserted based on the current state. The next state logic is derived from the current state and inputs, and the outputs are determined by the current state only, as per the Moore machine definition.

The implementation will use combinational logic to determine the next state and the outputs. We will use `always @(*)` blocks for combinational logic to ensure all inputs are considered in the sensitivity list. The module will adhere to the specified interface and coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.

The state transitions and output logic will be implemented using conditional assignments based on the current state and inputs. The next state signals (`B3_next`, `S_next`, `S1_next`, `Count_next`, `Wait_next`) will be asserted when the corresponding next state is reached. The outputs (`done`, `counting`, `shift_ena`) will be asserted based on the current state.
