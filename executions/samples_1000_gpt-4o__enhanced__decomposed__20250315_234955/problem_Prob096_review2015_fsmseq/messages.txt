        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal; triggers all sequential logic on the positive edge.\n- input wire reset: Active-high, synchronous reset signal.\n- input wire data: Input bit stream (1-bit).\n- output reg start_shifting: Output signal that becomes high when the sequence is detected.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module will implement a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the bit sequence \"1101\" in the input stream, 'data'.\n2. The FSM will consist of multiple states to represent partial detection of the sequence \"1101\".\n3. The output signal 'start_shifting' should be set to 1 once the sequence \"1101\" is detected and should remain high until a reset occurs.\n4. The reset signal is synchronous, meaning it affects the FSM state and 'start_shifting' output on the next positive clock edge when high.\n5. The initial state of the FSM and 'start_shifting' should be set to the default state (sequence not found) whenever reset is activated.\n\nBehavioral Details:\n- The FSM should transition states based on the input 'data' at each positive clock edge.\n- Upon detecting the final '1' of the sequence \"1101\", the FSM sets 'start_shifting' to 1.\n- The 'start_shifting' output, once set to 1, remains high until the next reset event.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The FSM must correctly handle any arbitrary length of input bit stream.\n- Overlapping sequences should be detected (e.g., in input \"1101101\", both sequences should be recognized).\n- The reset will clear the FSM to its initial state and set 'start_shifting' to 0 on the next positive clock edge if 'reset' is high.\n\nNote: Ensure that all state transitions and output logic are designed to avoid race conditions or glitches.\n                    "
