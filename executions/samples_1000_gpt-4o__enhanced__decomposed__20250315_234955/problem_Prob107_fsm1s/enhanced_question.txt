Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk` : 1-bit clock signal. It is used for synchronous operations.
  - `reset` : 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
  - `in` : 1-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `out` : 1-bit output signal.

Description:
This module implements a Moore state machine with two states, named 'A' and 'B'. The behavior of the state machine is determined by the input `in` and is as follows:

States and Transitions:
- State B:
  - Output `out` = 1
  - Transition to state A on `in = 0`
  - Remain in state B on `in = 1`

- State A:
  - Output `out` = 0
  - Transition to state B on `in = 0`
  - Remain in state A on `in = 1`

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is an active-high synchronous reset.
- On reset assertion (`reset = 1`), the state machine transitions to state B, regardless of the clock cycle.
- The reset state is B, where `out` = 1.

Clock and Timing:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`).
- The reset signal must be asserted synchronously with the clock to initialize the state to B.

Signal Indexing:
- All signals are 1-bit wide, with no additional indexing required.

Initial Values:
- The initial state of the state machine is B, with `out` = 1 upon reset.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The input `in` is considered stable during the rising edge of the clock.
- Ensure that the `reset` signal is de-asserted (set to 0) after initialization for normal operation.

This specification ensures the correct implementation of the described Moore state machine with clearly defined states, transitions, and signal behavior.
