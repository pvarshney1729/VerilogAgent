        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.\n- Outputs:\n  - `q`: 5-bit output representing the state of the LFSR.\n\nSpecification Details:\n1. The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n2. The LFSR is designed to cycle through 31 unique states (2^5 - 1), avoiding the all-zero state.\n3. The LFSR operates as follows:\n   - On each positive edge of the `clk`, the LFSR shifts right by one position.\n   - The least significant bit (LSB), `q[0]`, is used to compute the next state.\n   - The taps are located at bit positions 5 (`q[4]`) and 3 (`q[2]`).\n   - The next state's bit at position 5 (`q[4]`) is XORed with the current LSB (`q[0]`) if a tap is present.\n   - Bits without taps shift to the right unchanged.\n4. Reset Behavior:\n   - On an active-high `reset`, the LFSR synchronously resets to the binary value `00001`.\n   - This reset behavior occurs on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n5. Bit Indexing:\n   - Bit indices range from 4 (most significant bit, MSB) to 0 (least significant bit, LSB).\n6. Initial Conditions:\n   - Upon reset, the LFSR state is initialized to `00001`.\n7. Edge Cases:\n   - Ensure that the all-zero state is never reached or maintained during operation.\n\nNote: This specification assumes the correct implementation of the clock and reset logic to avoid race conditions and ensure predictable LFSR behavior.\n                    "
