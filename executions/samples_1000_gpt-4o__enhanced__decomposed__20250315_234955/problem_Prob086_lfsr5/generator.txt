<REASONING>
To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is `q`, which is a 5-bit vector.

2. **Signal Declaration**: Use `logic` to declare the internal signals and ports, as per the coding conventions.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that initializes the LFSR to the state `00001` when `reset` is high. This is done inside an `always_ff` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.

4. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the LFSR logic using a Galois configuration. The LFSR shifts right, and the feedback is applied to the taps at positions 5 and 3. The feedback is generated by XORing the LSB (`q[0]`) with the tapped positions.

5. **Bitwise Operations**: Ensure that the XOR operation is correctly applied to the tapped positions to generate the next state.

6. **Output Assignment**: Assign the LFSR state to the output `q`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specifications and coding conventions provided.
