Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
- Outputs:
  - `q`: 5-bit output representing the state of the LFSR.

Specification Details:
1. The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
2. The LFSR is designed to cycle through 31 unique states (2^5 - 1), avoiding the all-zero state.
3. The LFSR operates as follows:
   - On each positive edge of the `clk`, the LFSR shifts right by one position.
   - The least significant bit (LSB), `q[0]`, is used to compute the next state.
   - The taps are located at bit positions 5 (`q[4]`) and 3 (`q[2]`).
   - The next state's bit at position 5 (`q[4]`) is XORed with the current LSB (`q[0]`) if a tap is present.
   - Bits without taps shift to the right unchanged.
4. Reset Behavior:
   - On an active-high `reset`, the LFSR synchronously resets to the binary value `00001`.
   - This reset behavior occurs on the positive edge of the `clk`.
5. Bit Indexing:
   - Bit indices range from 4 (most significant bit, MSB) to 0 (least significant bit, LSB).
6. Initial Conditions:
   - Upon reset, the LFSR state is initialized to `00001`.
7. Edge Cases:
   - Ensure that the all-zero state is never reached or maintained during operation.

Note: This specification assumes the correct implementation of the clock and reset logic to avoid race conditions and ensure predictable LFSR behavior.
