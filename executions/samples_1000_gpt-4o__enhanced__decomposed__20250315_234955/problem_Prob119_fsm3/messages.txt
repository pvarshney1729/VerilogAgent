Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n  - areset: 1-bit, asynchronous reset signal, active high, resets the FSM to initial state A.\n  - in: 1-bit, primary input to the state machine.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit, output determined by current state of the FSM.\n\nState Machine Specifications:\n- Type: Moore State Machine\n- Number of States: 4\n- State Encoding: Use a 2-bit register to encode the states.\n  - State A: 2'b00\n  - State B: 2'b01\n  - State C: 2'b10\n  - State D: 2'b11\n\n- State Transition Table:\n  | Current State | Next State when in=0 | Next State when in=1 | Output |\n  |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|\n  | A (00)        | A (00)               | B (01)               | 0      |\n  | B (01)        | C (10)               | B (01)               | 0      |\n  | C (10)        | A (00)               | D (11)               | 0      |\n  | D (11)        | C (10)               | B (01)               | 1      |\n\n- Output Logic: \n  - The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state.\n  - Output is 0 for states A, B, and C. Output is 1 for state D.\n\nClock and Reset Specifications:\n- The FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.\n- The 'areset' signal is asynchronous and resets the FSM to state A.\n- Upon activation of 'areset', the FSM transitions immediately to state A, regardless of the clock signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- On initial power-up or upon reset, the FSM enters state A (2'b00).\n\nIndexing and Bit Conventions:\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) in multi-bit signals.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that all transitions are handled correctly during clock and reset signal changes to avoid metastability.\n\nDesign Assumptions:\n- Assume all flip-flops and sequential elements are positive-edge triggered.\n- No undefined or unused states. All possible 2-bit combinations are defined in the state table.\n\nNote: The state transition and output logic must be implemented according to the specified behavior in the table above.\n                    "
