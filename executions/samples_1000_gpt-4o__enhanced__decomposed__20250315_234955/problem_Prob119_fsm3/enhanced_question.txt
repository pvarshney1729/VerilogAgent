<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - areset: 1-bit, asynchronous reset signal, active high, resets the FSM to initial state A.
  - in: 1-bit, primary input to the state machine.

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit, output determined by current state of the FSM.

State Machine Specifications:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- Number of States: 4
- State Encoding: Use a 2-bit register to encode the states.
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

- State Transition Table:
  | Current State | Next State when in=0 | Next State when in=1 | Output |
  |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
  | A (00)        | A (00)               | B (01)               | 0      |
  | B (01)        | C (10)               | B (01)               | 0      |
  | C (10)        | A (00)               | D (11)               | 0      |
  | D (11)        | C (10)               | B (01)               | 1      |

- Output Logic: 
  - The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state.
  - Output is 0 for states A, B, and C. Output is 1 for state D.

Clock and Reset Specifications:
- The FSM is triggered on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.
- The 'areset' signal is asynchronous and resets the FSM to state A.
- Upon activation of 'areset', the FSM transitions immediately to state A, regardless of the clock signal.

Initial Conditions:
- On initial power-up or upon reset, the FSM enters state A (2'b00).

Indexing and Bit Conventions:
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) in multi-bit signals.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that all transitions are handled correctly during clock and reset signal changes to avoid metastability.

Design Assumptions:
- Assume all flip-flops and sequential elements are positive-edge triggered.
- No undefined or unused states. All possible 2-bit combinations are defined in the state table.

Note: The state transition and output logic must be implemented according to the specified behavior in the table above.
