Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. It is a Moore state machine with the following interface specifications:\n\n### Port Definitions\n- **Inputs**:\n  - `input wire in`: A single-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire [1:0] state`: A 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. The state encoding is as follows:\n    - State A: `2'b00`\n    - State B: `2'b01`\n    - State C: `2'b10`\n    - State D: `2'b11`\n\n- **Outputs**:\n  - `output wire [1:0] next_state`: A 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine.\n  - `output wire out`: A single-bit output signal.\n\n### State Transition Table and Output Logic\nThe state machine implements the following state transition and output logic:\n\n| Current State (state) | Next State if `in`=0 | Next State if `in`=1 | Output (out) |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|\n| A (`2'b00`)           | A (`2'b00`)          | B (`2'b01`)          | 0            |\n| B (`2'b01`)           | C (`2'b10`)          | B (`2'b01`)          | 0            |\n| C (`2'b10`)           | A (`2'b00`)          | D (`2'b11`)          | 0            |\n| D (`2'b11`)           | C (`2'b10`)          | B (`2'b01`)          | 1            |\n\n### Implementation Notes\n- The state transition and output logic should be implemented as combinational logic.\n- The output `next_state` should be determined solely by the current `state` and the input `in`, with no memory of previous states.\n- The output `out` is determined by the current state and is independent of the input signal `in`.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Ensure that all logic paths are explicitly defined to prevent indeterminate states or glitches due to race conditions.\n                    "
