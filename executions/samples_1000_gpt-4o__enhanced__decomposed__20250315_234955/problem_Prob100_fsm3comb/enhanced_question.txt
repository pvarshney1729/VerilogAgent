<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. It is a Moore state machine with the following interface specifications:

### Port Definitions
- **Inputs**:
  - `input wire in`: A single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [1:0] state`: A 2-bit input representing the current state of the state machine. The state encoding is as follows:
    - State A: `2'b00`
    - State B: `2'b01`
    - State C: `2'b10`
    - State D: `2'b11`

- **Outputs**:
  - `output wire [1:0] next_state`: A 2-bit output representing the next state of the state machine.
  - `output wire out`: A single-bit output signal.

### State Transition Table and Output Logic
The state machine implements the following state transition and output logic:

| Current State (state) | Next State if `in`=0 | Next State if `in`=1 | Output (out) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| A (`2'b00`)           | A (`2'b00`)          | B (`2'b01`)          | 0            |
| B (`2'b01`)           | C (`2'b10`)          | B (`2'b01`)          | 0            |
| C (`2'b10`)           | A (`2'b00`)          | D (`2'b11`)          | 0            |
| D (`2'b11`)           | C (`2'b10`)          | B (`2'b01`)          | 1            |

### Implementation Notes
- The state transition and output logic should be implemented as combinational logic.
- The output `next_state` should be determined solely by the current `state` and the input `in`, with no memory of previous states.
- The output `out` is determined by the current state and is independent of the input signal `in`.
- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- Ensure that all logic paths are explicitly defined to prevent indeterminate states or glitches due to race conditions.
