<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles upon reset and then keep it deasserted until another reset occurs. The reset is synchronous, meaning it should be sampled on the rising edge of the clock.

1. **State Encoding**: We'll use a simple counter to track the number of cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted. This counter will count from 4 down to 0.

2. **State Transition**: On reset, the counter is initialized to 4. On each clock cycle, if the counter is not zero, it decrements by 1. When the counter reaches zero, `shift_ena` is deasserted.

3. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` signal is asserted whenever the counter is greater than zero.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented within the clocked always block, ensuring that the reset is sampled with the clock.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the always block will be sensitive only to the clock edge, adhering to the synchronous reset requirement.

This approach ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 cycles after a reset and remains deasserted otherwise.
