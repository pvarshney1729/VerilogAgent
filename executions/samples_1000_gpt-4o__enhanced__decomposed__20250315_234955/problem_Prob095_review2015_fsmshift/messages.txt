        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: `clk` (1-bit) - Clock signal, all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n- Input: `reset` (1-bit) - Active high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, it initializes the FSM and the output.\n- Output: `shift_ena` (1-bit) - Control signal to enable the shift register for 4 clock cycles.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control a shift register. The FSM has the following behavior:\n\n1. Upon detecting the proper bit pattern (specification of the pattern is assumed to be external to this description), the FSM enables the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles by asserting `shift_ena`.\n\n2. Upon receiving a reset signal (`reset` is high), the FSM should immediately initialize and assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles, regardless of the current state. After this, `shift_ena` should remain deasserted (low) indefinitely until another reset occurs or the proper bit pattern is detected again.\n\n3. The FSM and all its associated sequential elements are clocked on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset (`reset`) is a synchronous active high signal. Upon assertion of `reset`, the FSM should transition to the initial state, and `shift_ena` should be asserted for 4 clock cycles before being deasserted.\n- Initial values for all registers and flip-flops should be explicitly defined. Upon reset, all registers should be set to a state that enables the 4-cycle assertion of `shift_ena`.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- Ensure that `shift_ena` is asserted precisely for 4 clock cycles, with no overlap or gaps, both after reset and upon detection of the bit pattern.\n- The FSM should correctly handle back-to-back resets and pattern detections without missing the 4-cycle window for `shift_ena`.\n\nNote: The specification assumes that pattern detection logic is handled externally and triggers the FSM to enable the shift register when appropriate.\n                    "
