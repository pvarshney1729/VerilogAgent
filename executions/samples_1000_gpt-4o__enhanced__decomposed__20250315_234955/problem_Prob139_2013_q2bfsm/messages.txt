Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPorts:\n- input clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- input resetn: Active low, synchronous reset signal.\n- input x: Input signal from the motor.\n- input y: Input signal from the motor.\n- output reg f: Output signal to control the motor.\n- output reg g: Output signal to control the motor.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. Reset Behavior:\n   - The FSM remains in the initial state (State A) while resetn is asserted (logic 0).\n   - Upon de-assertion of resetn (logic 1), the FSM transitions from State A on the next positive clock edge.\n\n2. FSM Initial Actions:\n   - After resetn is de-asserted, the FSM sets f = 1 for one clock cycle on the first positive clock edge.\n\n3. Transition Conditions:\n   - From State A, the FSM monitors the x input.\n   - The FSM transitions to the next relevant state when x follows the sequence: 1, 0, 1 over three successive clock cycles.\n\n4. Output Logic for g:\n   - Upon detecting the x sequence (1, 0, 1), the FSM sets g = 1 on the next clock cycle.\n   - While g = 1, the FSM monitors the y input:\n     - If y = 1 within two clock cycles, g remains 1 permanently until reset.\n     - If y \u2260 1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently until reset.\n\n5. Edge Cases and Initial Conditions:\n   - All registers, including f and g, should be initialized to 0 during reset.\n   - The FSM should handle input edge cases by maintaining proper state transitions based on the described conditions.\n\n6. Clock and Reset Note:\n   - All sequential elements are triggered by the positive edge of clk.\n   - Reset behavior is synchronous, affecting state transitions and output register values.\n\n7. Bit Indexing and MSB/LSB Conventions:\n   - Not applicable for single-bit signals in this specification.\n\n8. Additional Considerations:\n   - Ensure no race conditions by adhering to the described clock-edge-triggering mechanisms.\n                    "
