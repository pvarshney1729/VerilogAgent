<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- input clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input resetn: Active low, synchronous reset signal.
- input x: Input signal from the motor.
- input y: Input signal from the motor.
- output reg f: Output signal to control the motor.
- output reg g: Output signal to control the motor.

Specifications:
1. Reset Behavior:
   - The FSM remains in the initial state (State A) while resetn is asserted (logic 0).
   - Upon de-assertion of resetn (logic 1), the FSM transitions from State A on the next positive clock edge.

2. FSM Initial Actions:
   - After resetn is de-asserted, the FSM sets f = 1 for one clock cycle on the first positive clock edge.

3. Transition Conditions:
   - From State A, the FSM monitors the x input.
   - The FSM transitions to the next relevant state when x follows the sequence: 1, 0, 1 over three successive clock cycles.

4. Output Logic for g:
   - Upon detecting the x sequence (1, 0, 1), the FSM sets g = 1 on the next clock cycle.
   - While g = 1, the FSM monitors the y input:
     - If y = 1 within two clock cycles, g remains 1 permanently until reset.
     - If y â‰  1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently until reset.

5. Edge Cases and Initial Conditions:
   - All registers, including f and g, should be initialized to 0 during reset.
   - The FSM should handle input edge cases by maintaining proper state transitions based on the described conditions.

6. Clock and Reset Note:
   - All sequential elements are triggered by the positive edge of clk.
   - Reset behavior is synchronous, affecting state transitions and output register values.

7. Bit Indexing and MSB/LSB Conventions:
   - Not applicable for single-bit signals in this specification.

8. Additional Considerations:
   - Ensure no race conditions by adhering to the described clock-edge-triggering mechanisms.
