<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore state machine, we need to define two states: `OFF` and `ON`. The state transitions are based on the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` is determined solely by the current state.

1. **State Encoding**: We'll use a single bit to represent the two states: `OFF` (0) and `ON` (1).

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The `areset` signal is an active-high asynchronous reset that forces the state machine to the `OFF` state.

3. **State Transition Logic**: 
   - From `OFF`, transition to `ON` if `j=1`; otherwise, remain in `OFF`.
   - From `ON`, transition to `OFF` if `k=1`; otherwise, remain in `ON`.

4. **Output Logic**: 
   - In state `OFF`, `out` is `0`.
   - In state `ON`, `out` is `1`.

5. **Coding Conventions**: 
   - Use `logic` for all signals.
   - Use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.
   - Use `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` for sequential logic with asynchronous reset.

By following these steps, we ensure the implementation adheres to the specification and coding conventions.
