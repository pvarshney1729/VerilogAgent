        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule` and has the following interface. Each input and output port is a single bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input clk`: The clock signal, used for synchronizing state transitions.\n- `input areset`: An asynchronous active-high reset signal that, when asserted, resets the state machine to the initial state `OFF`.\n- `input j`: Input signal used for state transitions from `OFF` to `ON`.\n- `input k`: Input signal used for state transitions from `ON` to `OFF`.\n- `output reg out`: The output signal representing the current state output. It is a registered output to ensure it holds state information correctly.\n\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with two states, named `OFF` and `ON`, and operates based on the following state transition diagram:\n- State `OFF`: The output `out` is `0`.\n  - Transition to `OFF` remains when `j=0`.\n  - Transition to `ON` occurs when `j=1`.\n- State `ON`: The output `out` is `1`.\n  - Transition to `ON` remains when `k=0`.\n  - Transition to `OFF` occurs when `k=1`.\n\nThe reset signal `areset` is an asynchronous reset that takes precedence over all other operations and transitions. When `areset` is asserted (`areset=1`), the state machine immediately transitions to the `OFF` state regardless of the clock or other input signals.\n\nThe state machine transitions occur on the rising edge of the `clk` signal, except when the asynchronous reset is active. Ensure that the reset state of all registers is explicitly defined as follows:\n- On `areset`, set the state to `OFF` and `out` to `0`.\n\nBit indexing conventions do not apply since all signals are single-bit. The state transitions are evaluated based on the inputs `j` and `k` as described, ensuring no race conditions occur due to the asynchronous nature of the reset signal.\n                    "
