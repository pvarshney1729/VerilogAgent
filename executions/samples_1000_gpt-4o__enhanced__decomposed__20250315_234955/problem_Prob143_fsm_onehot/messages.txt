        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input wire in;`\n    - Description: Single-bit input signal used for state transitions.\n  - `input wire [9:0] state;`\n    - Description: One-hot encoded current state vector. Each bit represents a state, with `state[0]` being the least significant bit corresponding to S0 and `state[9]` corresponding to S9.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output wire [9:0] next_state;`\n    - Description: One-hot encoded next state vector. Each bit represents the transition to a specific state, with `next_state[0]` through `next_state[9]` corresponding to S0 through S9 respectively.\n  - `output wire out1;`\n    - Description: Single-bit output. Primarily 0 except when specified by state transitions.\n  - `output wire out2;`\n    - Description: Single-bit output. Primarily 0 except when specified by state transitions.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The state machine is defined with states S0 to S9, using one-hot encoding.\n- Each state transition is triggered by the `in` input, moving to a new state based on the current state and input value.\n- Outputs `(out1, out2)` are predominantly `(0, 0)` except for specific transitions where they are explicitly defined otherwise.\n\nState Transitions and Outputs:\n- S0: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S1\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`\n- S1: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S2\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`\n- S2: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S3\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`\n- S3: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S4\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`\n- S4: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S5\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`\n- S5: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S8\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S6\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`\n- S6: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S9\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S7\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`\n- S7: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S7\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 1)`\n- S8: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S1\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (1, 0)`\n- S9: \n  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0\n  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S1\n  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (1, 1)`\n\nAdditional Details:\n- The module must handle cases where multiple states are active in the input `state[9:0]`. This may occur if the input vector represents a combination of states, and the module should appropriately transition each active state to its respective next state.\n- Ensure that the output `next_state` is a valid one-hot encoded vector reflecting the transitions of all active states.\n- The design does not include the state flip-flops; it only implements the combinational logic for determining the next state and outputs based on the current state and input.\n                    "
