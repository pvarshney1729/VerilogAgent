Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire in;`
    - Description: Single-bit input signal used for state transitions.
  - `input wire [9:0] state;`
    - Description: One-hot encoded current state vector. Each bit represents a state, with `state[0]` being the least significant bit corresponding to S0 and `state[9]` corresponding to S9.

- Outputs:
  - `output wire [9:0] next_state;`
    - Description: One-hot encoded next state vector. Each bit represents the transition to a specific state, with `next_state[0]` through `next_state[9]` corresponding to S0 through S9 respectively.
  - `output wire out1;`
    - Description: Single-bit output. Primarily 0 except when specified by state transitions.
  - `output wire out2;`
    - Description: Single-bit output. Primarily 0 except when specified by state transitions.

State Machine Description:
- The state machine is defined with states S0 to S9, using one-hot encoding.
- Each state transition is triggered by the `in` input, moving to a new state based on the current state and input value.
- Outputs `(out1, out2)` are predominantly `(0, 0)` except for specific transitions where they are explicitly defined otherwise.

State Transitions and Outputs:
- S0: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S1
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
- S1: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S2
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
- S2: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S3
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
- S3: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S4
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
- S4: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S5
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
- S5: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S8
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S6
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
- S6: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S9
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S7
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 0)`
- S7: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S7
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (0, 1)`
- S8: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S1
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (1, 0)`
- S9: 
  - Transition: `in == 0` --> S0
  - Transition: `in == 1` --> S1
  - Output: `(out1, out2) = (1, 1)`

Additional Details:
- The module must handle cases where multiple states are active in the input `state[9:0]`. This may occur if the input vector represents a combination of states, and the module should appropriately transition each active state to its respective next state.
- Ensure that the output `next_state` is a valid one-hot encoded vector reflecting the transitions of all active states.
- The design does not include the state flip-flops; it only implements the combinational logic for determining the next state and outputs based on the current state and input.
