<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to follow the state machine transitions and output logic as specified. The state machine uses one-hot encoding, meaning each state is represented by a single bit in a 10-bit vector. The transitions depend on the input `in`, and the outputs `out1` and `out2` are determined by the current state.

1. **State Transition Logic**: For each state, we determine the next state based on the input `in`. The transitions are straightforward as per the given state diagram. We will use an `always @(*)` block to implement the combinational logic for determining `next_state`.

2. **Output Logic**: The outputs `out1` and `out2` are determined by the current state. Most states have outputs `(0, 0)`, except for S7 `(0, 1)`, S8 `(1, 0)`, and S9 `(1, 1)`.

3. **Handling Multiple Active States**: Since the input `state` can be a combination of multiple active states, we need to ensure that the `next_state` reflects transitions for all active states. This is achieved by checking each bit of the `state` vector and updating the `next_state` accordingly.

4. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the `always @(*)` block for combinational logic. We will ensure that all numeric constants are properly sized.

5. **No Synchronous Reset**: The specification does not mention a reset, so we will not implement one.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the module adheres to the specification and coding conventions.
