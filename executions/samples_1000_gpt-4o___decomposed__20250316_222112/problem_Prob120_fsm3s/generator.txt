<REASONING>
To implement the requested Moore state machine, we need to define a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified interface. The module will have a synchronous reset that resets the FSM to state A. The state machine has four states (A, B, C, D) with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a 2-bit encoding for the states, as there are four states. This will be done using `localparam` for clarity and maintainability.

2. **State Register**: A register will hold the current state, and it will be updated on the positive edge of the clock. The reset logic will ensure that the state is set to A when the reset is active.

3. **Next State Logic**: A combinational block will determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`.

4. **Output Logic**: Another combinational block will set the output `out` based on the current state.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the combinational logic will be implemented using `always @(*)`. The synchronous reset will be handled within the sequential `always` block triggered by `posedge clk`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the given specifications and coding conventions.
