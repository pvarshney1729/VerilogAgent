<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule`, we need to design a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes specific bit patterns in a continuous bit stream. The FSM should detect three conditions: 
1. A sequence of `0111110` which requires discarding a bit.
2. A sequence of `01111110` which indicates a flag for frame boundaries.
3. A sequence of `01111111...` which indicates an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s.

The FSM will have states representing the number of consecutive 1s detected. The state transitions will be based on the input bit, and the outputs (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) will be determined by the current state. The FSM should reset to an initial state that behaves as if the previous input were 0. The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with the clock.

The FSM will be implemented using an always block for state transitions and another always block for output logic. The state encoding will be done using an enumerated type for clarity. The outputs will be asserted for one clock cycle after the respective condition is detected.
