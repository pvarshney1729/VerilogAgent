<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define two states, OFF and ON, and handle transitions based on inputs j and k. The state machine will have a synchronous reset to the OFF state. The output is determined solely by the current state, making it a Moore machine. We will use a single-bit logic type for the state and next_state variables, and implement the state transition and output logic using always blocks. The synchronous reset will be handled in the state transition always block, triggered by the clock edge.
