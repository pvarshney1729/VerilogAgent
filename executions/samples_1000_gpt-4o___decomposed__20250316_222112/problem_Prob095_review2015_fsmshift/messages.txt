Define states: IDLE (2'b00), ASSERT (2'b01), and DONE (2'b10).\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding using localparam for binary encoding\n  localparam IDLE   = 2'b00;\n  localparam ASSERT = 2'b01;\n  localparam DONE   = 2'b10;\n\n  // State register declaration\n  reg [1:0] state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with synchronous reset logic. On reset, transition to ASSERT state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam ASSERT = 1'b0;\n  localparam IDLE   = 1'b1;\n\n  // State register\n  reg state;\n\n  // Synchronous reset logic\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      state <= ASSERT;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
