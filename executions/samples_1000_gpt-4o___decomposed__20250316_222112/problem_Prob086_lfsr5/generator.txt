<REASONING>
To implement the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The output `q` is a 5-bit vector.

2. **Signal Declaration**: Use `logic` to declare the internal register that holds the state of the LFSR. This will be a 5-bit register.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the LFSR state to `5'b00001` when the reset signal is high. This ensures that the LFSR starts from a known state.

4. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the Galois LFSR logic. The LFSR shifts right, and the feedback is applied to the MSB. The feedback is generated by XORing the current LSB with the taps at positions 5 and 3. This means `q[4]` will be XORed with `q[2]` to generate the new `q[4]`.

5. **Output Assignment**: Assign the internal LFSR state to the output `q`.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the specified coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring the synchronous reset is implemented correctly.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specification and adheres to the coding guidelines provided.
