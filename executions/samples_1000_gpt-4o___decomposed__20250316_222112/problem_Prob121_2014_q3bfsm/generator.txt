To implement the FSM as specified, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports.

2. **State Encoding**: Use 3-bit encoding for the states as described in the state table.

3. **State Register**: Implement a state register to hold the current state. This register should be updated on the positive edge of the clock and reset synchronously to state `000` when the reset signal is high.

4. **Next State Logic**: Use combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current state and input `x`. This will be implemented using a `case` statement.

5. **Output Logic**: Determine the output `z` based on the current state using a `case` statement.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the provided coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and using `always @(*)` for combinational logic.

7. **Synchronous Reset**: Ensure the reset logic is synchronous, meaning it is checked within the clocked always block.

By following these steps, we can ensure the FSM behaves as specified in the state table.
