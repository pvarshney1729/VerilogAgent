Use reg [1:0] for current_state and next_state. Define localparam A = 2'b00 and B = 2'b01 for state encoding.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg [1:0] current_state, next_state;\n  localparam A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with synchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk) and set current_state to B when reset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg current_state;\n  parameter A = 1'b0, B = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      current_state <= B;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on the input 'in' and current_state.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg current_state, next_state;\n\n  // State encoding\n  localparam STATE_A = 1'b0;\n  localparam STATE_B = 1'b1;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      STATE_B: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n      end\n      STATE_A: begin\n        if (in == 1'b0)\n          next_state = STATE_B;\n        else\n          next_state = STATE_A;\n      end\n      default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to reset state\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statement. Set out = 1 when current_state is B and out = 0 when current_state is A.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// Define the states\n  typedef enum logic [0:0] {\n    A = 1'b0,\n    B = 1'b1\n  } state_t;\n\n  // Declare the current state signal\n  state_t current_state;\n\n  // Combinational logic for output\n  assign out = (current_state == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;\n                    "
