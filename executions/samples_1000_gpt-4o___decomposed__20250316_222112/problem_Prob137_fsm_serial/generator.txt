<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that can detect a start bit, process 8 data bits, and verify a stop bit in a serial data stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0) to begin receiving a byte.
2. **START**: Once a start bit is detected, transition to this state to confirm the start of a byte.
3. **DATA**: In this state, the FSM will count and process 8 data bits.
4. **STOP**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (logic 1).
5. **ERROR**: If the stop bit is not detected correctly, transition to this state and wait for a valid stop bit before returning to IDLE.

The FSM will use a synchronous reset to initialize the state to IDLE. The `done` output will be asserted when a complete byte is correctly received, including the stop bit.

The FSM will be implemented using a state register and a next-state logic block. The state register will be updated on the positive edge of the clock, and the next-state logic will determine the transitions based on the current state and input.

The `bit_counter` will be used to count the 8 data bits. The `done` signal will be set high when the FSM is in the STOP state and the stop bit is detected correctly.

Following the coding conventions, all signals will be declared as `logic`, and the combinational logic will use `always @(*)`.
