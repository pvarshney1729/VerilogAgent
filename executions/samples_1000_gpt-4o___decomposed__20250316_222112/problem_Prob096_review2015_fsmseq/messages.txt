S1101 : IDLE;\n            S1101: next_state = S1101;\n            default: next_state = IDLE;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n\nSUBTASK 2: Declare the state register and state encoding using reg [1:0] for the FSM states. Use binary encoding for states: IDLE=2'b00, S1=2'b01, S2=2'b10, S3=2'b11.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam IDLE = 2'b00;\n  localparam S1   = 2'b01;\n  localparam S2   = 2'b10;\n  localparam S3   = 2'b11;\n\n  // State register\n  reg [1:0] state;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with synchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk) and reset the state to IDLE when reset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg [1:0] state;\n  parameter IDLE = 2'b00;\n\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n      state <= IDLE;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic would go here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*) block. Define state transitions based on the input data to detect the sequence 1101.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n    IDLE    = 3'b000,\n    S1      = 3'b001,\n    S11     = 3'b010,\n    S110    = 3'b011,\n    S1101   = 3'b100\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (current_state)\n      IDLE: begin\n        if (data == 1'b1)\n          next_state = S1;\n        else\n          next_state = IDLE;\n      end\n      S1: begin\n        if (data == 1'b1)\n          next_state = S11;\n        else\n          next_state = IDLE;\n      end\n      S11: begin\n        if (data == 1'b0)\n          next_state = S110;\n        else\n          next_state = S11;\n      end\n      S110: begin\n        if (data == 1'b1)\n          next_state = S1101;\n        else\n          next_state = IDLE;\n      end\n      S1101: begin\n        next_state = S1101; // Remain in S1101 once sequence is detected\n      end\n      default: begin\n        next_state = IDLE;\n      end\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statement. Set start_shifting to 1 when the FSM reaches the final state S3, indicating the sequence 1101 is detected.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nassign start_shifting = (state == S3);\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n"
