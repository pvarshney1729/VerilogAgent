<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule`, we need to design a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in a serial bit stream. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: Initial state, waiting for the first `1` of the sequence.
2. **S1**: Detected the first `1`.
3. **S11**: Detected `11`.
4. **S110**: Detected `110`.
5. **S1101**: Detected the complete sequence `1101`.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input `data`. Once the sequence `1101` is detected, the FSM enters the `S1101` state and sets `start_shifting` to `1`. This output remains `1` until a reset occurs.

The reset is synchronous, meaning it is checked on the rising edge of the clock. When reset is active (high), the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state, and `start_shifting` is set to `0`.

The implementation will use an `always` block for the state transitions and another `always` block for the next state logic. The `start_shifting` output will be controlled based on the current state.
