Use binary encoding for states: OFF=2'b00, ON=2'b01.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg [1:0] state;\n  localparam OFF = 2'b00, ON = 2'b01;\n\nSUBTASK 3: Implement the state register with asynchronous reset logic. Use always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) to reset the state to OFF when areset is high.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nreg state;\n  parameter OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset) begin\n      state <= OFF;\n    end else begin\n      // State transition logic will be implemented here\n    end\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 4: Implement the next state combinational logic using always @(*). Define state transitions based on inputs j and k according to the state diagram.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  typedef enum logic [0:0] {\n    OFF = 1'b0,\n    ON  = 1'b1\n  } state_t;\n\n  state_t state, next_state;\n\n  // Next state logic\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (state)\n      OFF: begin\n        if (j)\n          next_state = ON;\n        else\n          next_state = OFF;\n      end\n      ON: begin\n        if (k)\n          next_state = OFF;\n        else\n          next_state = ON;\n      end\n      default: next_state = OFF;\n    endcase\n  end\n\nSUBTASK 5: Implement the output combinational logic using assign statements. Set output out based on the current state: out=0 for OFF, out=1 for ON.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n// State encoding\n  localparam OFF = 1'b0;\n  localparam ON  = 1'b1;\n\n  // Output combinational logic based on current state\n  assign out = (current_state == OFF) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1;\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
