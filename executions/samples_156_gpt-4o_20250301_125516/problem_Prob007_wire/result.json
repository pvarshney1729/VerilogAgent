The output reflects the input immediately without\n// any modification or delay.\n\n// Interface:\n// - input logic in_signal: Single-bit input signal. It is assumed to be unsigned.\n// - output logic out_signal: Single-bit output signal. It is assumed to be unsigned.\n\n// Behavior:\n// The module implements a combinational connection between `in_signal` and `out_signal`.\n// The value of `out_signal` is always equal to the value of `in_signal`.\n\n// Timing and Propagation:\n// - This is a purely combinational logic block. The output `out_signal` changes\n//   in accordance with the input `in_signal` without any clock dependency or delay.\n\n// Reset Behavior:\n// - There is no reset logic required or implemented, as the module's behavior is\n//   purely combinational and stateless.\n\n// Initial State:\n// - Not applicable, as this module does not contain any stateful elements like registers.\n\n// Boundary Conditions:\n// - Any change in `in_signal` is immediately reflected in `out_signal`\n//   in the same simulation time step.\n\nassign out_signal = in_signal;\n\nendmodule\n```",
