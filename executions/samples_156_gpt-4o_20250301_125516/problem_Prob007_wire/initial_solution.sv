```verilog
module TopModule (
    input logic in_signal, // Renamed for clarity and to avoid potential keyword conflicts
    output logic out_signal // Renamed for clarity
);

// Module Description:
// This module implements a direct connection between the input and output,
// functioning as a wire. The output reflects the input immediately without
// any modification or delay.

// Interface:
// - input logic in_signal: Single-bit input signal. It is assumed to be unsigned.
// - output logic out_signal: Single-bit output signal. It is assumed to be unsigned.

// Behavior:
// The module implements a combinational connection between `in_signal` and `out_signal`.
// The value of `out_signal` is always equal to the value of `in_signal`.

// Timing and Propagation:
// - This is a purely combinational logic block. The output `out_signal` changes
//   in accordance with the input `in_signal` without any clock dependency or delay.

// Reset Behavior:
// - There is no reset logic required or implemented, as the module's behavior is
//   purely combinational and stateless.

// Initial State:
// - Not applicable, as this module does not contain any stateful elements like registers.

// Boundary Conditions:
// - Any change in `in_signal` is immediately reflected in `out_signal`
//   in the same simulation time step.

assign out_signal = in_signal;
