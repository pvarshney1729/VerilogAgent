// Module Declaration: TopModule
// Description: This module continuously drives the output 'out' to a logic low (0).
// All ports in this module are one bit wide and unsigned unless explicitly stated.

module TopModule (
    output logic out  // Output port: 'out' is a one-bit unsigned signal.
);

// Behavioral Description:
// The module is purely combinational and will always drive the output 'out' to 0.

assign out = 1'b0; // The '1'b0' indicates a binary literal of width 1, value 0.

// Timing Behavior:
// This module is combinational and does not depend on any clock signal.

// Reset Behavior:
// There is no reset logic applicable for this module as it outputs a constant value.

// Initial States:
// Initial states are not relevant, as the module's output is constantly driven to 0.

// Dependencies and Logical Descriptions:
// There are no dependencies or precedence operations involved. The module's behavior is entirely static.

// Boundary Conditions:
// There are no boundary conditions or edge cases, as the module's output is invariant.
