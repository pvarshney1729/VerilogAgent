Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. The clock is assumed to be active on the rising edge.
  - reset: 1-bit input representing the reset signal. This signal is active high and synchronous.

- Output Ports:
  - q: 10-bit output representing the counter value. The output is indexed as q[9:0], where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[9] is the most significant bit (MSB).

Functionality:
- The module implements a synchronous counter that counts from 0 to 999 (inclusive).
- The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The counter has a period of 1000 clock cycles, meaning it will reset to 0 after reaching 999.
- Upon receiving a high signal on the reset input, the counter will reset to 0 on the next positive edge of the clk.

Initial Conditions:
- The counter output q should be initialized to 0 when the reset signal is asserted.

Edge Cases:
- The counter should handle the transition from 999 back to 0 seamlessly without any glitches.
- Ensure that the counter does not exceed the value of 999 and wraps around correctly.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals, with the reset taking precedence over the counting operation.
