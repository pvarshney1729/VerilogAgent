Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input representing the clock signal. The clock is assumed to be active on the rising edge.\n  - reset: 1-bit input representing the reset signal. This signal is active high and synchronous.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 10-bit output representing the counter value. The output is indexed as q[9:0], where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[9] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a synchronous counter that counts from 0 to 999 (inclusive).\n- The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The counter has a period of 1000 clock cycles, meaning it will reset to 0 after reaching 999.\n- Upon receiving a high signal on the reset input, the counter will reset to 0 on the next positive edge of the clk.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The counter output q should be initialized to 0 when the reset signal is asserted.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The counter should handle the transition from 999 back to 0 seamlessly without any glitches.\n- Ensure that the counter does not exceed the value of 999 and wraps around correctly.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals, with the reset taking precedence over the counting operation.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
