Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - b: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned)

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following truth table derived from the provided simulation waveforms:

| Time (ns) | a | b | q |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| 0         | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5         | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 10        | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 15        | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 20        | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 25        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 30        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 35        | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 40        | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 45        | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 50        | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 55        | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 60        | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 65        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 70        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 75        | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 80        | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 85        | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 90        | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Behavioral Description:
- The output q is determined by the values of inputs a and b as follows:
  - q = 1 when a = 1 and b = 1.
  - q = 0 in all other cases.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the module is implemented as a purely combinational circuit with no internal state or memory elements.
- The output q should be updated immediately based on the current values of inputs a and b without any delay.
- There are no edge cases or boundary conditions to consider beyond the defined input values of a and b (0 or 1).

Timing:
- The module does not have any clock or reset signals as it is purely combinational.
- The output q should reflect the correct value based on the inputs a and b at all times.
