<REASONING>
To determine the logic function implemented by the module, we need to analyze the provided simulation waveforms. The truth table derived from the waveforms is as follows:

- When `a = 0` and `b = 0`, `q = 0`
- When `a = 0` and `b = 1`, `q = 0`
- When `a = 1` and `b = 0`, `q = 0`
- When `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `q = 1`

From this truth table, we can see that the output `q` is `1` only when both `a` and `b` are `1`. This behavior corresponds to the logical AND operation. Therefore, the module should implement `q = a & b`.

Now, let's implement the Verilog module following the given guidelines and coding conventions.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic q
);
    // Implementing the AND operation
    assign q = a & b;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic q
);
    // Implementing the AND operation
    assign q = a & b;
endmodule
