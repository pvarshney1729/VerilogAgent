Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 255 bits
  - Description: A 255-bit wide input vector where each bit represents a binary value (0 or 1). The least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0] and the most significant bit (MSB) is bit[254].

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 8 bits
  - Description: An 8-bit wide output representing the population count of '1's in the input vector. The LSB is bit[0] and the MSB is bit[7].

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit that calculates the population count of the input vector 'in'. The output 'out' will represent the total number of bits set to '1' in the input vector.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The output 'out' will be updated immediately based on the input 'in' without any clock cycle dependencies, as this is a purely combinational logic operation.
- The output 'out' will be in the range of 0 to 255, corresponding to the possible number of '1's in the 255-bit input vector.

Edge Cases:
- If the input vector 'in' is all zeros (i.e., in = 255'b0), then the output 'out' should be 8'b00000000.
- If the input vector 'in' is all ones (i.e., in = 255'b111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111), then the output 'out' should be 8'b11111111.

Initial Conditions:
- There are no registers or flip-flops in this module, as it is purely combinational logic. Therefore, no initial values are required.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the input 'in'. Any change in 'in' will result in an immediate recalculation of 'out'.
