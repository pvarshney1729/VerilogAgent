<REASONING>
To implement a population count circuit for a 255-bit input vector, we need to count the number of '1's in the input vector and output this count as an 8-bit number. The maximum number of '1's in a 255-bit vector is 255, which can be represented with 8 bits (since 2^8 = 256).

The implementation will involve iterating over each bit of the input vector, checking if it is '1', and incrementing a counter accordingly. This can be efficiently done using a combinational logic block. We will use an `always @(*)` block to ensure that the logic is combinational and updates whenever the input changes.

The module will have a single 255-bit input and an 8-bit output. We will declare all ports and internal signals as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions. The output will be the result of the population count.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [254:0] in,  // 255-bit input
    output logic [7:0] out   // 8-bit output
);

    // Combinational logic to count the number of '1's in the input vector
    always @(*) begin
        integer i;
        out = 8'd0;  // Initialize the output to zero
        for (i = 0; i < 255; i = i + 1) begin
            if (in[i] == 1'b1) begin
                out = out + 1'b1;  // Increment the count for each '1'
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
