        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input:\n  - scancode: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned) - This input represents the scancode received from a PS/2 keyboard.\n\n- Output:\n  - left: bit (1 bit, unsigned) - Asserts high (1) when the left arrow key is pressed.\n  - down: bit (1 bit, unsigned) - Asserts high (1) when the down arrow key is pressed.\n  - right: bit (1 bit, unsigned) - Asserts high (1) when the right arrow key is pressed.\n  - up: bit (1 bit, unsigned) - Asserts high (1) when the up arrow key is pressed.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module processes the 16-bit scancode input to determine if one of the arrow keys (left, down, right, up) has been pressed. The mapping of scancodes to arrow keys is as follows:\n\n- When scancode[15:0] is 16'hE06B, assert left = 1.\n- When scancode[15:0] is 16'hE072, assert down = 1.\n- When scancode[15:0] is 16'hE074, assert right = 1.\n- When scancode[15:0] is 16'hE075, assert up = 1.\n- For any other value of scancode[15:0], all outputs (left, down, right, up) should be asserted low (0).\n\nImplementation Details:\n- The outputs (left, down, right, up) should be combinational logic derived from the input scancode.\n- Ensure that only one output can be high at any given time, corresponding to the pressed arrow key.\n- If multiple scancodes are received in quick succession, the module should consistently reflect the most recent valid scancode.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the scancode input is not one of the specified values, all output signals must be low (0).\n- The module should handle any invalid or unexpected scancode inputs gracefully without causing erroneous output states.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There is no explicit reset condition defined in this specification; the outputs should default to low (0) when no valid scancode is detected.\n                    "
