Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - in: bit[99:0] (100 bits) - A 100-bit input vector.

- Output Ports:
  - out_both: bit[99:0] (100 bits) - Indicates if both the corresponding input bit and its left neighbor are '1'.
  - out_any: bit[99:0] (100 bits) - Indicates if either the corresponding input bit or its right neighbor is '1'.
  - out_different: bit[99:0] (100 bits) - Indicates if the corresponding input bit is different from its left neighbor.

Functional Description:
1. out_both:
   - For each bit index i (0 ≤ i ≤ 99):
     - out_both[i] = (in[i] AND in[i+1]) if i < 99
     - out_both[99] = 0 (since in[99] has no left neighbor)

2. out_any:
   - For each bit index i (0 ≤ i ≤ 99):
     - out_any[i] = (in[i] OR in[i-1]) if i > 0
     - out_any[0] = 0 (since in[0] has no right neighbor)

3. out_different:
   - For each bit index i (0 ≤ i ≤ 99):
     - out_different[i] = (in[i] XOR in[i+1]) if i < 99
     - out_different[99] = (in[99] XOR in[0]) (wrapping around behavior)

Reset Behavior:
- The module does not specify a reset condition. If a reset is required, please define the reset behavior and initial states for all output ports.

Clocking:
- The module is combinational and does not require clocking.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the outputs are correctly set to zero for out_both[99] and out_any[0] as specified.

Signal Dependencies:
- The outputs depend on the values of the input vector in and its neighboring bits as described above.
