<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that has a single output port `out`, which should always drive a logic low (0). Since the output is constant and does not depend on any input or clock, we can use a continuous assignment with an `assign` statement to drive the output to 0. This approach is straightforward and efficient for such a simple requirement. There is no need for any internal logic or state, so the implementation will be minimal.

The guidelines and conventions provided are more relevant for more complex modules involving sequential logic, synchronous resets, and combinational logic with dependencies. However, for this specific task, we only need to ensure that the output is correctly assigned to 0 using the correct Verilog syntax.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic out
);
    // Assign the output to logic low (0)
    assign out = 1'b0;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
