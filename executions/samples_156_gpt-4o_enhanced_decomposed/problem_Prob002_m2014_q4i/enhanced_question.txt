<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Type: Logic (driven low)

Functional Description:
- The module shall continuously drive the output port 'out' to a logic low state (0).
- The output 'out' is defined as follows:
  - out[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
  
Behavior:
- The output 'out' shall remain at logic low (0) at all times, regardless of any input signals.
- There are no input ports for this module.

Reset Behavior:
- No reset mechanism is required as the output is statically driven low.

Timing:
- The module operates combinationally, with no clock cycles or sequential logic involved.

Edge Cases:
- There are no edge cases to consider as the output is constant and does not depend on any input conditions.

Initial State:
- The output 'out' is initialized to logic low (0) upon instantiation of the module.
