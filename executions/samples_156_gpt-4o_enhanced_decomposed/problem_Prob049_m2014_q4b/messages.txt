Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - ar: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal, active high)\n  - d: 1-bit input (data input)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 1-bit output (data output)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a D flip-flop with the following characteristics:\n- The flip-flop is positive edge-triggered, meaning that the output 'q' will be updated on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal.\n- The 'ar' input provides an asynchronous reset functionality. When 'ar' is high, the output 'q' will be immediately reset to '0', regardless of the clock signal or the data input 'd'.\n- The output 'q' will take the value of the input 'd' on the rising edge of 'clk' when 'ar' is low.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The output 'q' should be initialized to '0' when the module is reset by the 'ar' signal.\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- 'clk' is the clock signal used for synchronization.\n- 'ar' is the asynchronous reset signal, which takes precedence over the clock.\n- 'd' is the data input that is sampled on the rising edge of 'clk' when 'ar' is not asserted.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If 'ar' is asserted (high) during any clock cycle, 'q' will be reset to '0' immediately, regardless of the state of 'd' or the clock.\n- If 'ar' is deasserted (low) and a rising edge of 'clk' occurs, 'q' will be updated to the value of 'd'.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All signals are 1-bit wide, with bit[0] referring to the least significant bit (LSB).\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  ar\n - input  d\n - output q\n\nThe module should implement a D flip flop, positive edge triggered, with\nan asynchronous reset \"ar\".\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
