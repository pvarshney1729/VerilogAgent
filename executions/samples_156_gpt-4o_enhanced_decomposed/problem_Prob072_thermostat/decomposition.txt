Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  mode
 - input  too_cold
 - input  too_hot
 - input  fan_on
 - output heater
 - output aircon
 - output fan

The module should implement a heating/cooling thermostat controller which
controls both a heater (during winter) and an air conditioner (during
summer). The module should on and off the heater, air conditioning, and
blower fan as appropriate. The thermostat can be in one of two modes:
heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the
heater on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1) but do not use the air
conditioner. In cooling mode, turn the air conditioner on when it is too
hot (too_hot = 1), but do not turn on the heater. When the heater or air
conditioner are on, also turn on the fan to circulate the air. In
addition, the user can also request the fan to turn on (fan_on = 1), even
if the heater and air conditioner are off.
