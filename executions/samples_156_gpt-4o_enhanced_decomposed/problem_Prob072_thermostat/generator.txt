<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a combinational logic circuit that controls the heater, air conditioner, and fan based on the input signals `mode`, `too_cold`, `too_hot`, and `fan_on`. The module operates in two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0).

1. **Heater Control**: 
   - The heater should be turned on when the system is in heating mode (`mode = 1`) and it is too cold (`too_cold = 1`).
   - The heater should be off in cooling mode (`mode = 0`).

2. **Air Conditioner Control**:
   - The air conditioner should be turned on when the system is in cooling mode (`mode = 0`) and it is too hot (`too_hot = 1`).
   - The air conditioner should be off in heating mode (`mode = 1`).

3. **Fan Control**:
   - The fan should be turned on if either the heater or air conditioner is on.
   - Additionally, the fan should be turned on if the user requests it (`fan_on = 1`), regardless of the heater or air conditioner status.

The logic for each output can be derived as follows:
- `heater = mode & too_cold`
- `aircon = ~mode & too_hot`
- `fan = heater | aircon | fan_on`

We will use an `always @(*)` block to implement the combinational logic for these outputs.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic mode,
    input logic too_cold,
    input logic too_hot,
    input logic fan_on,
    output logic heater,
    output logic aircon,
    output logic fan
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Heater control logic
        heater = mode & too_cold;
        
        // Air conditioner control logic
        aircon = ~mode & too_hot;
        
        // Fan control logic
        fan = heater | aircon | fan_on;
    end

endmodule
