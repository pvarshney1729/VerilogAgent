Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in; // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire [9:0] state; // 10-bit input representing the current state in one-hot encoding
- Output Ports:
  - output wire [9:0] next_state; // 10-bit output representing the next state in one-hot encoding
  - output wire out1; // 1-bit output signal
  - output wire out2; // 1-bit output signal

State Machine Description:
The state machine operates with one-hot encoding for states S0 to S9, where:
- state[0] corresponds to S0
- state[1] corresponds to S1
- state[2] corresponds to S2
- state[3] corresponds to S3
- state[4] corresponds to S4
- state[5] corresponds to S5
- state[6] corresponds to S6
- state[7] corresponds to S7
- state[8] corresponds to S8
- state[9] corresponds to S9

Output Logic:
- The outputs out1 and out2 are initialized to 0 unless specified otherwise in the state transitions.
- The next_state outputs (next_state[0] to next_state[9]) are set based on the current state and input signal 'in'. For example, next_state[1] is set to 1 when transitioning to state S1, and 0 otherwise.

State Transition Logic:
The state transitions are defined as follows:
- From S0 (state[0] = 1):
  - If in = 0, remain in S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S1 (next_state[1] = 1).
- From S1 (state[1] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S2 (next_state[2] = 1).
- From S2 (state[2] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S3 (next_state[3] = 1).
- From S3 (state[3] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S4 (next_state[4] = 1).
- From S4 (state[4] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S5 (next_state[5] = 1).
- From S5 (state[5] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S8 (next_state[8] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S6 (next_state[6] = 1).
- From S6 (state[6] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S9 (next_state[9] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S7 (next_state[7] = 1).
- From S7 (state[7] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, remain in S7 (next_state[7] = 1).
- From S8 (state[8] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S1 (next_state[1] = 1).
- From S9 (state[9] = 1):
  - If in = 0, transition to S0 (next_state[0] = 1).
  - If in = 1, transition to S1 (next_state[1] = 1).

Input State Interpretation:
The input state[9:0] can represent multiple active states simultaneously. For example, if state[9:0] = 10'b0000010100, it indicates that states S4 (state[4] = 1) and S2 (state[2] = 1) are active.

Implementation Requirements:
- The module should implement the combinational logic for state transitions and output generation based on the current state and input signal.
- The module does not include the state flip-flops; it only computes the next state and outputs based on the current state and input.
