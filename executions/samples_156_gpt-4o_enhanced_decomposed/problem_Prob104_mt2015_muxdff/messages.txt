Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named `TopModule` shall be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.\n\n- **Input Ports:**\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal (active on the rising edge).\n  - `input L`: Load signal (active high).\n  - `input q_in`: Input data for the flip-flop.\n  - `input r_in`: Input data for the multiplexer.\n\n- **Output Ports:**\n  - `output reg Q`: Output of the flip-flop.\n\n**Functional Description:**\nThe `TopModule` will consist of a flip-flop and a 2:1 multiplexer. The flip-flop will store the value of `Q`, which can be loaded from `r_in` when `L` is asserted. If `L` is not asserted, the flip-flop will retain its previous value.\n\n**Signal Definitions:**\n- The output `Q` is a 1-bit register that will hold the state of the flip-flop.\n- The input `q_in` will be used as the data input for the flip-flop when `L` is asserted.\n\n**Clocking and Reset Behavior:**\n- The module will operate on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- There is no asynchronous reset specified; therefore, the initial state of `Q` should be defined explicitly (e.g., `Q` should be initialized to `0`).\n\n**Sequential Logic:**\n- The flip-flop will be implemented using a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) to ensure proper sequential behavior.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- When `L` is asserted, the value of `Q` will be updated to `r_in` on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n- If `L` is not asserted, `Q` will retain its previous value.\n\n**Instantiation:**\n- The `TopModule` will be instantiated three times in the `full_module`, each instance corresponding to one of the three bits of the `q` output.\n\n**Bit Indexing:**\n- The output `Q` will be indexed as `Q[0]` for the least significant bit (LSB) and `Q[2]` for the most significant bit (MSB) if expanded to a multi-bit output in the full module.\n\n**Naming Conventions:**\n- All signals should follow a consistent naming convention for clarity and maintainability.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
