<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named `TopModule` shall be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

- **Input Ports:**
  - `input clk`: Clock signal (active on the rising edge).
  - `input L`: Load signal (active high).
  - `input q_in`: Input data for the flip-flop.
  - `input r_in`: Input data for the multiplexer.

- **Output Ports:**
  - `output reg Q`: Output of the flip-flop.

**Functional Description:**
The `TopModule` will consist of a flip-flop and a 2:1 multiplexer. The flip-flop will store the value of `Q`, which can be loaded from `r_in` when `L` is asserted. If `L` is not asserted, the flip-flop will retain its previous value.

**Signal Definitions:**
- The output `Q` is a 1-bit register that will hold the state of the flip-flop.
- The input `q_in` will be used as the data input for the flip-flop when `L` is asserted.

**Clocking and Reset Behavior:**
- The module will operate on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
- There is no asynchronous reset specified; therefore, the initial state of `Q` should be defined explicitly (e.g., `Q` should be initialized to `0`).

**Sequential Logic:**
- The flip-flop will be implemented using a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) to ensure proper sequential behavior.

**Edge Cases:**
- When `L` is asserted, the value of `Q` will be updated to `r_in` on the next rising edge of `clk`.
- If `L` is not asserted, `Q` will retain its previous value.

**Instantiation:**
- The `TopModule` will be instantiated three times in the `full_module`, each instance corresponding to one of the three bits of the `q` output.

**Bit Indexing:**
- The output `Q` will be indexed as `Q[0]` for the least significant bit (LSB) and `Q[2]` for the most significant bit (MSB) if expanded to a multi-bit output in the full module.

**Naming Conventions:**
- All signals should follow a consistent naming convention for clarity and maintainability.
