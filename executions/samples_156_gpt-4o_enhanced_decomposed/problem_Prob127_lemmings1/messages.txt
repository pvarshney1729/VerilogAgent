        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)\n  - bump_left: 1-bit input (indicates a bump from the left)\n  - bump_right: 1-bit input (indicates a bump from the right)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - walk_left: 1-bit output (active high indicates walking left)\n  - walk_right: 1-bit output (active high indicates walking right)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of Lemmings in a 2D world. The Lemmings can be in one of two states:\n1. State 0: Walking Left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0)\n2. State 1: Walking Right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1)\n\nState Transition Conditions:\n- If bump_left is asserted (1), the Lemming will transition to State 1 (walk_right = 1).\n- If bump_right is asserted (1), the Lemming will transition to State 0 (walk_left = 1).\n- If both bump_left and bump_right are asserted simultaneously, the Lemming will switch directions according to the bump conditions.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The areset signal is an asynchronous active-high reset. When areset is asserted, the FSM will reset to State 0 (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0) regardless of the clock state.\n\nClocking:\n- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset (when areset is high), the outputs should be initialized as follows:\n  - walk_left = 1\n  - walk_right = 0\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle the scenario where both bump_left and bump_right are asserted at the same time, ensuring that the Lemming switches directions according to the bump conditions without any race conditions.\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- walk_left and walk_right are mutually exclusive outputs; only one can be high at any given time.\n- The least significant bit (LSB) is defined as bit[0] for all input and output ports.\n\nState Diagram:\n- The FSM can be represented as follows:\n  - State 0 (Walking Left) transitions to State 1 (Walking Right) on bump_left = 1.\n  - State 1 (Walking Right) transitions to State 0 (Walking Left) on bump_right = 1.\n                    "
