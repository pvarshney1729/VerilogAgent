<REASONING>
To implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Interface Definition**: Define the module with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is `q`, which is 32 bits wide.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the LFSR to an initial value of `32'h1` when the reset signal is high. This means the reset logic will be inside the clocked always block.

3. **LFSR Logic**: Implement the Galois LFSR logic. In a Galois LFSR, the new value of each bit is determined by shifting the current value to the right and XORing the taps with the least significant bit (LSB). The taps are at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1, which correspond to indices 31, 21, 1, and 0 in zero-based indexing.

4. **Sequential Logic**: Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to update the LFSR state. The LFSR should shift right, and the new value of the MSB should be the XOR of the LSB and the tapped bits.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and ensure the reset logic is synchronous by not including `reset` in the sensitivity list of the always block.

    logic [31:0] lfsr;

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            lfsr <= 32'h1;
        end else begin
            lfsr <= {lfsr[30:0], lfsr[31] ^ lfsr[21] ^ lfsr[1] ^ lfsr[0]};
        end
    end

    assign q = lfsr;
