<REASONING>
To implement the Moore machine as described, we need to define two states, A and B. Each state has a specific output associated with it: state A outputs 0, and state B outputs 1. The state transitions are determined by the input signal `in` and are as follows:

- From state B, if `in` is 0, transition to state A; if `in` is 1, remain in state B.
- From state A, if `in` is 0, transition to state B; if `in` is 1, remain in state A.

The module should asynchronously reset to state B when `areset` is high. This means that the reset condition is independent of the clock and should immediately set the state to B.

We will use an enumerated type to represent the states for clarity. The state transitions and output logic will be implemented using a sequential always block for state transitions and a combinational always block for output logic.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic areset,
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        STATE_A = 2'b00,
        STATE_B = 2'b01
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= STATE_B; // Asynchronous reset to state B
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always_comb begin
        case (current_state)
            STATE_A: begin
                if (in)
                    next_state = STATE_A;
                else
                    next_state = STATE_B;
            end
            STATE_B: begin
                if (in)
                    next_state = STATE_B;
                else
                    next_state = STATE_A;
            end
            default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to state B
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic
    always_comb begin
        case (current_state)
            STATE_A: out = 1'b0;
            STATE_B: out = 1'b1;
            default: out = 1'b1; // Default to output of state B
        endcase
