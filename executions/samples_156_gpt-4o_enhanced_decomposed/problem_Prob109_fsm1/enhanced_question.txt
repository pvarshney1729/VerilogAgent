Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal)
  - in: 1-bit input (data input)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (data output)

State Machine Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B. The state transitions are defined as follows:

States:
- State A (represented by 1'b0)
- State B (represented by 1'b1)

State Transition Diagram:
- From State B (1) with input 0, transition to State A (0).
- From State B (1) with input 1, remain in State B (1).
- From State A (0) with input 0, transition to State B (1).
- From State A (0) with input 1, remain in State A (0).

Reset Behavior:
- The module shall have an asynchronous reset. When the areset signal is high (1), the state machine shall reset to State B (1) immediately, regardless of the clock signal.

Additional Specifications:
- The output 'out' shall reflect the current state of the state machine, where 'out' is high (1) when in State B and low (0) when in State A.
- The clock signal (clk) is used for state transitions on the rising edge.
- All flip-flops and registers must be initialized to a defined state upon reset.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state machine handles transitions correctly for all combinations of input signals, particularly when transitioning from State A to State B and vice versa.
