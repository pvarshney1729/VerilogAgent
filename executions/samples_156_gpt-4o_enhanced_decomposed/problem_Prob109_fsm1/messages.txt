Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal)\n  - in: 1-bit input (data input)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output (data output)\n\nState Machine Description:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with two states: A and B. The state transitions are defined as follows:\n\nStates:\n- State A (represented by 1'b0)\n- State B (represented by 1'b1)\n\nState Transition Diagram:\n- From State B (1) with input 0, transition to State A (0).\n- From State B (1) with input 1, remain in State B (1).\n- From State A (0) with input 0, transition to State B (1).\n- From State A (0) with input 1, remain in State A (0).\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module shall have an asynchronous reset. When the areset signal is high (1), the state machine shall reset to State B (1) immediately, regardless of the clock signal.\n\nAdditional Specifications:\n- The output 'out' shall reflect the current state of the state machine, where 'out' is high (1) when in State B and low (0) when in State A.\n- The clock signal (clk) is used for state transitions on the rising edge.\n- All flip-flops and registers must be initialized to a defined state upon reset.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the state machine handles transitions correctly for all combinations of input signals, particularly when transitioning from State A to State B and vice versa.\n                    "
