        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - aresetn: 1-bit input (active low asynchronous reset)\n  - x: 1-bit input (input signal for sequence detection)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - z: 1-bit output (asserted high when the sequence \"101\" is detected)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Mealy-type finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes the overlapping sequence \"101\" on the input signal x. The output signal z is asserted to logic high (1) when the sequence is detected.\n\nState Machine:\n- The FSM shall consist of exactly 3 states.\n- The states must be defined to track the progress of detecting the sequence \"101\".\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The aresetn signal is an active low asynchronous reset. When aresetn is low (0), the FSM should reset to its initial state, and the output z should be deasserted (logic low, 0).\n- The initial state of the FSM and the output z must be clearly defined.\n\nClocking:\n- All sequential logic, including state transitions and output generation, is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should handle cases where the input x changes during the clock cycle, ensuring that the detection of the sequence \"101\" is accurate and does not produce false positives.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output z is dependent on the current state of the FSM and the current value of the input x.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions in the state transitions and output generation.\n\nPlease ensure that all flip-flops, registers, and sequential elements have explicitly defined initial values and that the behavior of the FSM is well-documented.\n                    "
