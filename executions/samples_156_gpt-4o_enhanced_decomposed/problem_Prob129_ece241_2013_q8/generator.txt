<REASONING>
To implement a Mealy-type FSM that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal `x`, we need to define three states. Let's name them as follows:
- `S0`: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.
- `S1`: State after detecting the first '1'.
- `S2`: State after detecting '10'.

The FSM transitions are as follows:
- From `S0` to `S1` on input `x = 1`.
- From `S1` to `S2` on input `x = 0`.
- From `S2` to `S0` on input `x = 1` (and output `z = 1` because the sequence "101" is detected).

The FSM should also handle overlapping sequences, meaning after detecting "101", it should be ready to detect another sequence starting from the last '1'.

The reset is asynchronous and active low, meaning the FSM should reset to `S0` on the negative edge of `aresetn`.

The output `z` is asserted to logic-1 when the sequence "101" is detected, which occurs during the transition from `S2` to `S0`.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic aresetn,
    input logic x,
    output logic z
);

    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        S0 = 2'b00,
        S1 = 2'b01,
        S2 = 2'b10
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin
        if (!aresetn)
            current_state <= S0;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Next state logic
    always_comb begin
        next_state = current_state; // Default to hold state
        z = 1'b0; // Default output

        case (current_state)
            S0: begin
                if (x)
                    next_state = S1;
            end
            S1: begin
                if (!x)
                    next_state = S2;
            end
            S2: begin
                if (x) begin
                    next_state = S1;
                    z = 1'b1; // Sequence "101" detected
                end
            end
