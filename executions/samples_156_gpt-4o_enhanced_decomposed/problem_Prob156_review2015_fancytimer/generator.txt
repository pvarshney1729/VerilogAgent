<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that handles the detection of the input pattern `1101`, shifts in the next 4 bits to determine the delay, and then counts down for `(delay + 1) * 1000` clock cycles. The FSM will have several states: IDLE, PATTERN_DETECT, LOAD_DELAY, COUNTING, and DONE. 

1. **IDLE State**: The FSM starts in this state and waits for the pattern `1101` to be detected on the `data` input. We will use a shift register to detect this pattern.

2. **PATTERN_DETECT State**: Once the pattern is detected, the FSM transitions to this state to shift in the next 4 bits, which determine the delay.

3. **LOAD_DELAY State**: After loading the delay, the FSM transitions to this state to prepare for counting.

4. **COUNTING State**: The FSM counts down for `(delay + 1) * 1000` clock cycles. During this time, the `counting` output is asserted, and the `count` output shows the remaining time in terms of 1000 clock cycles.

5. **DONE State**: Once counting is complete, the FSM transitions to this state, asserts the `done` signal, and waits for the `ack` signal to return to the IDLE state.

The synchronous reset will ensure that the FSM starts in the IDLE state and all registers are initialized to zero. The `count` output is a don't-care when not in the COUNTING state, so it can be left as is.
