<REASONING>
To implement the functionality of the 7458 chip using Verilog, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with the specified inputs and outputs. The chip consists of four AND gates and two OR gates. The outputs are determined by the following logic:

1. `p1y` is the OR of two 3-input AND gates:
   - The first AND gate takes inputs `p1a`, `p1b`, and `p1c`.
   - The second AND gate takes inputs `p1d`, `p1e`, and `p1f`.
   - The outputs of these two AND gates are then ORed together to produce `p1y`.

2. `p2y` is the OR of two 2-input AND gates:
   - The first AND gate takes inputs `p2a` and `p2b`.
   - The second AND gate takes inputs `p2c` and `p2d`.
   - The outputs of these two AND gates are then ORed together to produce `p2y`.

We will use `assign` statements to implement the combinational logic, as there is no need for sequential logic or a clock signal in this design. We will declare all ports and intermediate signals as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic p1a,
    input  logic p1b,
    input  logic p1c,
    input  logic p1d,
    input  logic p1e,
    input  logic p1f,
    input  logic p2a,
    input  logic p2b,
    input  logic p2c,
    input  logic p2d,
    output logic p1y,
    output logic p2y
);

    // Intermediate signals for AND gate outputs
    logic and1_out, and2_out, and3_out, and4_out;

    // AND gate logic
    assign and1_out = p1a & p1b & p1c;
    assign and2_out = p1d & p1e & p1f;
    assign and3_out = p2a & p2b;
    assign and4_out = p2c & p2d;

    // OR gate logic
    assign p1y = and1_out | and2_out;
    assign p2y = and3_out | and4_out;

endmodule
