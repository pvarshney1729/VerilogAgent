Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a;           // 1-bit input signal 'a'\n  - input wire b;           // 1-bit input signal 'b'\n  - input wire sel_b1;      // 1-bit selection signal 'sel_b1'\n  - input wire sel_b2;      // 1-bit selection signal 'sel_b2'\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out_assign; // 1-bit output signal for the assign statement\n  - output reg out_always;  // 1-bit output signal for the procedural if statement\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux) that selects between the input signals 'a' and 'b' based on the values of the selection signals 'sel_b1' and 'sel_b2'. \n\nSelection Logic:\n- The output 'out_assign' should be assigned the value of 'b' if both 'sel_b1' and 'sel_b2' are true (i.e., both are logic high). Otherwise, 'out_assign' should take the value of 'a'.\n- The output 'out_always' should be determined using a procedural if statement with the same selection criteria as 'out_assign'.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- The output 'out_always' should be defined as a reg type to accommodate procedural assignment.\n- Ensure that both outputs are updated correctly based on the selection signals without introducing race conditions.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The behavior of the module should be clearly defined for all possible combinations of the input signals 'sel_b1' and 'sel_b2', including when both are low, one is high, or both are high.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are specified in this module. Ensure that the outputs are initialized appropriately based on the selection logic.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

Otherwise, choose a. Do the\nsame twice, once using assign statements and once using a procedural if\nstatement.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
