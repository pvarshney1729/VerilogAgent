Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - x: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Represents the first operand for addition.\n  - y: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned) - Represents the second operand for addition.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - sum: bit[4:0] (5 bits, unsigned) - Represents the result of the addition, including the overflow bit.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a 4-bit binary adder using full adder logic.\n- The output 'sum' will be calculated as the sum of inputs 'x' and 'y', with the most significant bit (MSB) of 'sum' indicating overflow.\n\nBehavior:\n- The addition operation is combinational logic, meaning the output 'sum' is updated immediately based on the current values of 'x' and 'y'.\n- There are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved in this module.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The output 'sum' will correctly represent the result of adding the maximum values of 'x' and 'y' (i.e., 15 + 15 = 30), where the overflow bit will be set to 1.\n- If both inputs are 0, the output 'sum' will be 0.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are specified for this module as it is purely combinational.\n                    "

The output sum should include\nthe overflow bit.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
