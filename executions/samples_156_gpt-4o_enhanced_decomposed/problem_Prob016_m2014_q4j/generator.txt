<REASONING>
To implement a 4-bit adder using full adders, we need to add two 4-bit numbers, `x` and `y`, and produce a 5-bit output `sum` that includes the overflow bit. Each full adder takes two input bits and a carry-in bit, and it produces a sum bit and a carry-out bit. We will chain four full adders together, where the carry-out of one adder becomes the carry-in of the next.

1. **Define the Module Interface**: The module `TopModule` will have two 4-bit inputs `x` and `y`, and a 5-bit output `sum`.

2. **Full Adder Logic**: Each full adder will compute:
   - `sum_bit = x_bit ^ y_bit ^ carry_in`
   - `carry_out = (x_bit & y_bit) | (carry_in & (x_bit ^ y_bit))`

3. **Chaining Full Adders**: 
   - The first full adder will have a carry-in of 0.
   - The carry-out of each full adder will be the carry-in for the next full adder.
   - The final carry-out will be the overflow bit.

4. **Output Construction**: The `sum` output will be constructed by concatenating the final carry-out (overflow) with the sum bits from each full adder.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and use `always @(*)` for combinational logic.
