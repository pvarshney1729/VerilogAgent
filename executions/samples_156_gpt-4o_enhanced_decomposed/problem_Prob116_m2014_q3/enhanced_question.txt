<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - x: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)
    - x[0]: Least Significant Bit (LSB)
    - x[3]: Most Significant Bit (MSB)

- Output Ports:
  - f: bit (1 bit, unsigned)

Functionality:
The module implements the logic function f as defined by the following Karnaugh map. The variable 'd' represents don't-care conditions, allowing for flexibility in output assignment.

Karnaugh Map:
                x[1] x[2]
      x[3] x[4]   00   01   11   10
        00       |  d  |  0  |  d  |  d  |
        01       |  0  |  d  |  1  |  0  |
        11       |  1  |  1  |  d  |  d  |
        10       |  1  |  1  |  0  |  d  |

Behavior:
- The output f should be determined based on the values of input x[3:0] according to the Karnaugh map.
- For all combinations of x that correspond to 'd', the output f can be assigned either 0 or 1 based on implementation convenience.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the output f is defined for all possible input combinations of x[3:0].
- The module should handle all input boundaries without producing undefined behavior.

Reset and Initialization:
- The module does not specify any reset conditions. If sequential elements are added in the future, define synchronous or asynchronous reset behavior and initial states for all registers.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that the output f is combinationally dependent on the input x[3:0] without any race conditions.

Note: This specification is intended to clarify the functional intent and implementation details of the TopModule without altering its original purpose.
