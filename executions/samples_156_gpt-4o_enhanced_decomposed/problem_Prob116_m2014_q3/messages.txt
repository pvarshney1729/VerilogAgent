Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - x: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)\n    - x[0]: Least Significant Bit (LSB)\n    - x[3]: Most Significant Bit (MSB)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - f: bit (1 bit, unsigned)\n\nFunctionality:\nThe module implements the logic function f as defined by the following Karnaugh map. The variable 'd' represents don't-care conditions, allowing for flexibility in output assignment.\n\nKarnaugh Map:\n                x[1] x[2]\n      x[3] x[4]   00   01   11   10\n        00       |  d  |  0  |  d  |  d  |\n        01       |  0  |  d  |  1  |  0  |\n        11       |  1  |  1  |  d  |  d  |\n        10       |  1  |  1  |  0  |  d  |\n\nBehavior:\n- The output f should be determined based on the values of input x[3:0] according to the Karnaugh map.\n- For all combinations of x that correspond to 'd', the output f can be assigned either 0 or 1 based on implementation convenience.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the output f is defined for all possible input combinations of x[3:0].\n- The module should handle all input boundaries without producing undefined behavior.\n\nReset and Initialization:\n- The module does not specify any reset conditions. If sequential elements are added in the future, define synchronous or asynchronous reset behavior and initial states for all registers.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- Ensure that the output f is combinationally dependent on the input x[3:0] without any race conditions.\n\nNote: This specification is intended to clarify the functional intent and implementation details of the TopModule without altering its original purpose.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
