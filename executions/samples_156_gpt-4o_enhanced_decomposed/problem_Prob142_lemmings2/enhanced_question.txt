Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)
  - bump_left: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the left)
  - bump_right: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the right)
  - ground: 1-bit input (indicates presence of ground; 0 = no ground, 1 = ground present)

- Output Ports:
  - walk_left: 1-bit output (active high indicates Lemming is walking left)
  - walk_right: 1-bit output (active high indicates Lemming is walking right)
  - aaah: 1-bit output (active high indicates Lemming is falling and saying "aaah")

Functional Description:
The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of Lemmings in a 2D environment. The Lemming can be in one of two states:
1. Walking Left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0)
2. Walking Right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1)

State Transitions:
- The Lemming will switch its walking direction based on the following conditions:
  - If bump_left is asserted (1), the Lemming will transition to walking right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1).
  - If bump_right is asserted (1), the Lemming will transition to walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0).
  - If both bump_left and bump_right are asserted simultaneously, the Lemming will still switch directions according to the bump conditions.

Falling Behavior:
- When ground = 0, the Lemming will fall and assert aaah (aaah = 1).
- When ground = 1, the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction it was walking before falling.
- Bumps (bump_left or bump_right) while falling do not affect the walking direction.
- If a bump occurs in the same clock cycle as ground transitions to 0 (but before falling), or if ground transitions to 1 while the Lemming is still falling, the walking direction remains unchanged.

Reset Behavior:
- The areset signal is a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that initializes the Lemming's state to walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0) upon assertion.

Clocking:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Initial Conditions:
- All output signals (walk_left, walk_right, aaah) should be defined upon reset and during state transitions to ensure correct operation.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the module handles simultaneous bumps and ground transitions correctly without introducing race conditions or undefined behavior.
