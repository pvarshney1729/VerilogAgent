        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)\n  - bump_left: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the left)\n  - bump_right: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the right)\n  - ground: 1-bit input (indicates presence of ground; 0 = no ground, 1 = ground present)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - walk_left: 1-bit output (active high indicates Lemming is walking left)\n  - walk_right: 1-bit output (active high indicates Lemming is walking right)\n  - aaah: 1-bit output (active high indicates Lemming is falling and saying \"aaah\")\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of Lemmings in a 2D environment. The Lemming can be in one of two states:\n1. Walking Left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0)\n2. Walking Right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1)\n\nState Transitions:\n- The Lemming will switch its walking direction based on the following conditions:\n  - If bump_left is asserted (1), the Lemming will transition to walking right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1).\n  - If bump_right is asserted (1), the Lemming will transition to walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0).\n  - If both bump_left and bump_right are asserted simultaneously, the Lemming will still switch directions according to the bump conditions.\n\nFalling Behavior:\n- When ground = 0, the Lemming will fall and assert aaah (aaah = 1).\n- When ground = 1, the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction it was walking before falling.\n- Bumps (bump_left or bump_right) while falling do not affect the walking direction.\n- If a bump occurs in the same clock cycle as ground transitions to 0 (but before falling), or if ground transitions to 1 while the Lemming is still falling, the walking direction remains unchanged.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The areset signal is a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that initializes the Lemming's state to walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0) upon assertion.\n\nClocking:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All output signals (walk_left, walk_right, aaah) should be defined upon reset and during state transitions to ensure correct operation.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the module handles simultaneous bumps and ground transitions correctly without introducing race conditions or undefined behavior.\n                    "
