Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 32 bits
  - Description: A 32-bit input vector representing data to be processed.
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 32 bits
  - Description: A 32-bit output vector that will contain the byte-reversed version of the input vector.
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

Functional Description:
- The module shall reverse the byte order of the 32-bit input vector 'in'. This means that the output 'out' will have the following relationship with 'in':
  - out[7:0] = in[31:24]
  - out[15:8] = in[23:16]
  - out[23:16] = in[15:8]
  - out[31:24] = in[7:0]

Behavioral Specifications:
- The operation is combinational, meaning that the output 'out' is determined solely by the current value of the input 'in' without any clock cycles or sequential elements involved.
- There are no resets or initial values required for this module as it does not contain any state-holding elements.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible values of the input vector 'in', including all zeros, all ones, and mixed values, ensuring that the byte-reversal operation is consistently applied across all input scenarios.
