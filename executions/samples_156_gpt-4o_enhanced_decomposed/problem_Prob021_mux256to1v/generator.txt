<REASONING>
To implement the 256-to-1 multiplexer, we need to select one of the 256 4-bit groups from the 1024-bit input vector based on the 8-bit selection input `sel`. Each 4-bit group is selected by multiplying the `sel` value by 4 to determine the starting bit position in the `in` vector. The output `out` will be assigned the 4 bits starting from this calculated position.

The module does not require a clock or reset since it is purely combinational logic. We will use an `always @(*)` block to describe the combinational behavior, ensuring that the output `out` is updated whenever there is a change in the input `in` or the selection `sel`.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [1023:0] in,
    input logic [7:0] sel,
    output logic [3:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Calculate the starting bit position for the selected 4-bit group
        integer start_bit;
        start_bit = sel * 4;
        
        // Assign the selected 4-bit group to the output
        out = in[start_bit +: 4];
    end

endmodule
