Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - d: 1-bit input (data input)
  - r: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: 1-bit output (data output)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a D flip-flop with the following characteristics:
- The flip-flop captures the value of the data input (d) on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
- The output (q) is updated to the value of d unless the reset (r) signal is asserted.
- When the reset signal (r) is high, the output (q) is set to 0, regardless of the clock or data input.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset (r) is active high and synchronous, meaning that the output (q) will only be reset to 0 on the rising edge of the clock when r is high.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon power-up or reset, the output (q) should be initialized to 0.

Signal Definitions:
- clk: Clock signal, used to synchronize the operation of the flip-flop.
- d: Data input signal, which is sampled on the rising edge of clk.
- r: Reset signal, which takes precedence over the clock and data input.
- q: Output signal representing the stored value of the flip-flop.

Edge Cases:
- If both r and d are asserted during the same clock cycle, the output (q) will be reset to 0 due to the priority of the reset signal.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals are treated as single-bit values, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
