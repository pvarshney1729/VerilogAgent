Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)
  - in: 1-bit input (data input signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (data output signal)

Functional Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
- The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.
- The state transitions and output behavior are defined by the following state transition table:

| Current State | Input (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------|
| A             | A             | B                  | 0      |
| B             | C             | B                  | 0      |
| C             | A             | D                  | 0      |
| D             | C             | B                  | 1      |

State Transition Details:
- The state machine transitions occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The areset signal is asynchronous and, when asserted (high), resets the state machine to state A regardless of the clk signal.

Reset Behavior:
- Upon assertion of areset, the state machine will immediately transition to state A, and the output out will be set to 0.

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and output assignments are to be implemented using flip-flops that are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The initial state of the state machine is undefined until the first assertion of areset.

Signal Definitions:
- The output out is determined solely by the current state of the state machine, following the Moore model.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state machine behaves correctly during transitions, particularly when the input signal in changes state at the clock edge.

Note: Ensure that all flip-flops and registers are initialized appropriately to avoid undefined behavior.
