Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)\n  - in: 1-bit input (data input signal)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output (data output signal)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:\n- The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.\n- The state transitions and output behavior are defined by the following state transition table:\n\n| Current State | Input (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |\n|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------|\n| A             | A             | B                  | 0      |\n| B             | C             | B                  | 0      |\n| C             | A             | D                  | 0      |\n| D             | C             | B                  | 1      |\n\nState Transition Details:\n- The state machine transitions occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The areset signal is asynchronous and, when asserted (high), resets the state machine to state A regardless of the clk signal.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon assertion of areset, the state machine will immediately transition to state A, and the output out will be set to 0.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions and output assignments are to be implemented using flip-flops that are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The initial state of the state machine is undefined until the first assertion of areset.\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- The output out is determined solely by the current state of the state machine, following the Moore model.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the state machine behaves correctly during transitions, particularly when the input signal in changes state at the clock edge.\n\nNote: Ensure that all flip-flops and registers are initialized appropriately to avoid undefined behavior.\n                    "
