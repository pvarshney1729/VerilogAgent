Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the positive edge)\n  - a: 1-bit input\n  - b: 1-bit input\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 1-bit output (observable output of the flip-flop)\n  - state: 1-bit output (current state of the flip-flop)\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule implements a sequential circuit that consists of combinational logic and a single 1-bit memory element (flip-flop). The flip-flop's output is observable through the output port 'state'. The circuit is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The flip-flop should have an initial state of 0 when the simulation starts (asynchronous reset behavior is not specified, thus assume no reset).\n- The output 'q' should reflect the state of the flip-flop at the positive edge of 'clk'.\n\nCombinational Logic:\n- The behavior of the circuit is determined by the inputs 'a' and 'b' and the current state of the flip-flop.
