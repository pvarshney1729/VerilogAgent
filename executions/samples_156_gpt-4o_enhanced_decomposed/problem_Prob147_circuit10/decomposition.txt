Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output q
 - output state

The module should implement a sequential circuit. The circuit consists of
combinational logic and one bit of memory (i.e., one flip-flop). The
output of the flip-flop has been made observable through the output
state. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

Read the simulation waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then
implement it.
