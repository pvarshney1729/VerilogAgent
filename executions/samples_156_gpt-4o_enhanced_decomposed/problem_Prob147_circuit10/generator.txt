<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to analyze the provided simulation waveforms to determine the behavior of the circuit. The circuit has two inputs `a` and `b`, and two outputs `q` and `state`. The `state` output represents the current state of the flip-flop, while `q` is the output of the combinational logic.

From the waveform, we can observe the following:
1. The `state` output changes on the positive edge of the clock.
2. The `q` output seems to depend on both the current state and the inputs `a` and `b`.

By examining the transitions:
- When `b` is `1`, `q` becomes `1` if the current `state` is `0`.
- When `a` is `1` and `b` is `0`, `q` remains `1` if the current `state` is `1`.
- When both `a` and `b` are `1`, `q` toggles its value.

The logic for `q` can be deduced as:
- `q = (state & a & ~b) | (~state & b)`

The `state` is updated on the positive edge of the clock:
- `state` toggles when both `a` and `b` are `1`.

The logic for updating `state` can be deduced as:
- `next_state = (a & b) ? ~state : state`

We will implement this logic in the `TopModule` using a flip-flop for `state` and combinational logic for `q`.

    // Combinational logic for q
    always @(*) begin
        q = (state & a & ~b) | (~state & b);
    end

    // Sequential logic for state
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (a & b) begin
            next_state = ~state;
        end else begin
            next_state = state;
        end
        state <= next_state;
    end
