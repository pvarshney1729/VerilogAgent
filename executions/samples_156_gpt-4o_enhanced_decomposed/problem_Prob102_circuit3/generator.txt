<REASONING>
To determine the logic function implemented by the module, we need to analyze the given truth table. The truth table provides the output `q` for all combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

From the truth table, we can observe the following:
- The output `q` is `1` for the following input combinations:
  - `a = 0, b = 1, c = 0, d = 1`
  - `a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0`
  - `a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1`
  - `a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1`
  - `a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0`
  - `a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 1`
  - `a = 1, b = 1, c = 0, d = 1`
  - `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0`
  - `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1`

From these observations, we can derive the logic expression for `q` using a Karnaugh map or by inspection. The expression can be simplified to:
- `q = (b & c) | (a & d)`

This expression indicates that `q` is `1` when either `b` and `c` are both `1`, or `a` and `d` are both `1`.

Now, let's implement this logic in Verilog.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);
    assign q = (b & c) | (a & d);
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);
    assign q = (b & c) | (a & d);
endmodule
