Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input
  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input
  - input logic c;  // 1-bit input
  - input logic d;  // 1-bit input
- Output Port:
  - output logic q; // 1-bit output

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following truth table derived from the provided simulation waveforms. The output 'q' is determined by the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' at any given time.

Truth Table:
| Time (ns) | a | b | c | d | q |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 10        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 15        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 20        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 25        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 30        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 35        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 40        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 45        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 50        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 55        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 60        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 65        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 70        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 75        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 80        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 85        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 90        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Implementation Notes:
- The module is purely combinational; there are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved.
- The output 'q' should be updated immediately based on the current values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
- Ensure that the logic for determining 'q' is derived from the truth table provided above.
- There are no resets or initial values for registers since this is a combinational circuit.
- Edge cases and input boundaries are implicitly handled by the truth table; ensure that all combinations of inputs are accounted for.
