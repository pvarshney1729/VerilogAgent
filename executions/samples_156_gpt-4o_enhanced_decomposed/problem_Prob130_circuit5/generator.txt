<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to determine the logic that maps the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` to the output `q` based on the provided simulation waveforms. The waveforms suggest that the output `q` depends on the value of `c`:

- When `c` is 0, `q` is `b`.
- When `c` is 1, `q` is `e`.
- When `c` is 2, `q` is `a`.
- When `c` is 3, `q` is `d`.
- For `c` values from 4 to 15, `q` is `f` (which is 4'b1111).

This pattern indicates a simple combinational logic circuit where the output `q` is selected based on the value of `c`. We can implement this using a case statement inside an always block that is sensitive to changes in the inputs.

            4'd2: q = a;
            4'd3: q = d;
            default: q = 4'b1111; // For c = 4 to 15
        endcase
    end
