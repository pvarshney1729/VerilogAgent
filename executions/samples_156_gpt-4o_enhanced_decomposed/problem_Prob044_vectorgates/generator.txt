<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to perform three operations based on the given inputs `a` and `b`, both of which are 3-bit wide:

1. **Bitwise OR**: This operation will be performed between corresponding bits of `a` and `b`. The result will be a 3-bit vector `out_or_bitwise`.

2. **Logical OR**: This operation will check if either `a` or `b` is non-zero. The result will be a single bit `out_or_logical`.

3. **Bitwise NOT**: This operation will be performed on both `a` and `b`. The result will be a 6-bit vector `out_not`, where the upper 3 bits are the NOT of `b` and the lower 3 bits are the NOT of `a`.

The module will be purely combinational, so we will use continuous assignments (`assign` statements) to compute the outputs. We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [2:0] a,
    input logic [2:0] b,
    output logic [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output logic out_or_logical,
    output logic [5:0] out_not
);

    // Bitwise OR operation
    assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;

    // Logical OR operation
    assign out_or_logical = |(a | b);

    // Bitwise NOT operation
    assign out_not = {~b, ~a};

endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
