<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that can detect a valid byte in a serial communication protocol with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The FSM waits for the start bit (logic 0).
2. **START**: The FSM confirms the start bit and prepares to receive data bits.
3. **DATA**: The FSM receives 8 data bits.
4. **STOP**: The FSM checks for the stop bit (logic 1).
5. **DONE**: The FSM indicates a successful byte reception.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input bit and the current state. The `done` output is asserted when a valid byte is received, i.e., when the FSM reaches the `DONE` state.

The synchronous reset will reset the FSM to the `IDLE` state. The FSM will be implemented using a case statement inside an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. The `done` signal will be set high when the FSM reaches the `DONE` state and will be reset to low otherwise.
