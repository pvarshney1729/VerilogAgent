        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)\n  - in: 1-bit input (serial data input)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - done: 1-bit output (indicates successful reception of a byte)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) designed to receive a byte of data transmitted in a serial format. The serial protocol consists of:\n- 1 start bit (logic level 0)\n- 8 data bits (LSB first)\n- 1 stop bit (logic level 1)\n\nThe FSM must perform the following operations:\n1. Detect the start bit (0).\n2. Wait for and capture all 8 data bits.\n3. Verify the presence of the stop bit (1) following the data bits.\n\nBehavioral Requirements:\n- The FSM must remain in a waiting state if the expected stop bit does not appear after receiving the data bits. It should only attempt to receive the next byte once a valid stop bit is detected.\n- The module must handle the idle state of the line, which is at logic level 1 when no data is being transmitted.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous. Upon activation, all internal registers and state variables should be initialized to their default states, ensuring the FSM starts in a known state.\n\nTiming and Edge Sensitivity:\n- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- The least significant bit (LSB) of the data byte is transmitted first, and the most significant bit (MSB) is transmitted last.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should be robust against noise and ensure that it only transitions states based on valid start and stop bit detections.\n                    "
