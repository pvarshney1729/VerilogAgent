Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent
along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes
from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8
data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing
is being transmitted (idle).

Implement a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the
start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was
correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait
until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol
sends the least significant bit first.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.
