Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)
  - in: 1-bit input (serial data input)
  
- Output Ports:
  - done: 1-bit output (indicates successful reception of a byte)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) designed to receive a byte of data transmitted in a serial format. The serial protocol consists of:
- 1 start bit (logic level 0)
- 8 data bits (LSB first)
- 1 stop bit (logic level 1)

The FSM must perform the following operations:
1. Detect the start bit (0).
2. Wait for and capture all 8 data bits.
3. Verify the presence of the stop bit (1) following the data bits.

Behavioral Requirements:
- The FSM must remain in a waiting state if the expected stop bit does not appear after receiving the data bits. It should only attempt to receive the next byte once a valid stop bit is detected.
- The module must handle the idle state of the line, which is at logic level 1 when no data is being transmitted.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous. Upon activation, all internal registers and state variables should be initialized to their default states, ensuring the FSM starts in a known state.

Timing and Edge Sensitivity:
- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Signal Definitions:
- The least significant bit (LSB) of the data byte is transmitted first, and the most significant bit (MSB) is transmitted last.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM should be robust against noise and ensure that it only transitions states based on valid start and stop bit detections.
