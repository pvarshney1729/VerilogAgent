Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit [0] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - b: bit [0] (1-bit input, unsigned)

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit [0] (1-bit output, unsigned)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic function that performs the XNOR operation on the input signals 'a' and 'b'. The output 'out' will be high (1) if both inputs are equal (either both 0 or both 1), and low (0) otherwise.

Truth Table:
| a | b | out |
|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 |  1  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the values of inputs 'a' and 'b'.
- There are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved in this module.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible combinations of the input signals 'a' and 'b' as specified in the truth table.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions specified for this module as it is purely combinational logic.

Initial Values:
- The output 'out' does not require an initial value specification as it is determined solely by the current values of inputs 'a' and 'b'.
