<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a module with two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`. The functionality required is an XNOR gate, which outputs a logic high (1) when both inputs are the same (either both 0 or both 1) and a logic low (0) when the inputs are different.

The XNOR operation can be directly implemented using the bitwise XNOR operator in Verilog, which is represented by `~^`. This operator will perform the XNOR operation on the inputs `a` and `b`.

Since the task is purely combinational and does not involve any sequential logic or reset signals, we will use an `assign` statement to directly assign the result of the XNOR operation to the output `out`.

We will follow the coding conventions provided, such as using `logic` for port declarations and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero, although this is not directly applicable here as we are not using numeric constants.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing the XNOR gate
    assign out = a ~^ b;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
