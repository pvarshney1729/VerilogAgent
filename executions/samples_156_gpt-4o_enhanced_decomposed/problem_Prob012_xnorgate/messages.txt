Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - a: bit [0] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - b: bit [0] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: bit [0] (1-bit output, unsigned)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a combinational logic function that performs the XNOR operation on the input signals 'a' and 'b'. The output 'out' will be high (1) if both inputs are equal (either both 0 or both 1), and low (0) otherwise.\n\nTruth Table:\n| a | b | out |\n|---|---|-----|\n| 0 | 0 |  1  |\n| 0 | 1 |  0  |\n| 1 | 0 |  0  |\n| 1 | 1 |  1  |\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the values of inputs 'a' and 'b'.\n- There are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved in this module.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible combinations of the input signals 'a' and 'b' as specified in the truth table.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There are no reset conditions specified for this module as it is purely combinational logic.\n\nInitial Values:\n- The output 'out' does not require an initial value specification as it is determined solely by the current values of inputs 'a' and 'b'.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - output out\n\nThe module should implement an XNOR gate.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
