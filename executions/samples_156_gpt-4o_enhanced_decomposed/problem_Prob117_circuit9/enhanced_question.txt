Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - a: 1-bit input (data signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: 3-bit output (data output)

Specifications:
- The module implements a sequential circuit.
- The output q is defined as a 3-bit vector, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[2] is the most significant bit (MSB).

Clock and Reset:
- The circuit operates on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- There is no explicit reset signal defined; the initial state of q is undefined (x) at time 0ns.

Behavior:
- The output q is determined by the input a and the clock cycles as follows:
  - At time 0ns, clk = 0, a = 1, q = x (undefined)
  - At time 5ns, clk = 1, a = 1, q transitions to 4 (binary 100)
  - At time 10ns, clk = 0, a = 1, q remains 4
  - At time 15ns, clk = 1, a = 1, q remains 4
  - At time 20ns, clk = 0, a = 1, q remains 4
  - At time 25ns, clk = 1, a = 1, q remains 4
  - At time 30ns, clk = 0, a = 1, q remains 4
  - At time 35ns, clk = 1, a = 1, q remains 4
  - At time 40ns, clk = 0, a = 1, q remains 4
  - At time 45ns, clk = 1, a = 0, q remains 4
  - At time 50ns, clk = 0, a = 0, q remains 4
  - At time 55ns, clk = 1, a = 0, q transitions to 5 (binary 101)
  - At time 60ns, clk = 0, a = 0, q remains 5
  - At time 65ns, clk = 1, a = 0, q transitions to 6 (binary 110)
  - At time 70ns, clk = 0, a = 0, q remains 6
  - At time 75ns, clk = 1, a = 0, q transitions to 0 (binary 000)
  - At time 80ns, clk = 0, a = 0, q remains 0
  - At time 85ns, clk = 1, a = 0, q transitions to 1 (binary 001)
  - At time 90ns, clk = 0, a = 0, q remains 1

Edge Cases:
- The output q should be monitored for transitions on the rising edge of clk.
- The behavior of the circuit should be verified against the provided timing diagram to ensure correct implementation.

Note: The exact functional behavior of the circuit must be inferred from the provided timing diagram and may require further analysis to determine the logic governing the transitions of q based on a.
