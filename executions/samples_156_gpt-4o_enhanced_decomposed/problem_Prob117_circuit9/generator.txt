<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to analyze the given waveform data to understand the behavior of the sequential circuit. The waveform shows the output `q` as a 3-bit value that changes based on the input `a` and the clock `clk`.

1. **Initial State**: At time 0ns, `q` is undefined (`x`), which is typical before the first clock edge in a simulation.

2. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - From 5ns to 40ns, when `a` is `1`, `q` remains `4` regardless of the clock edges.
   - At 45ns, `a` changes to `0`, and `q` remains `4` until the next clock edge.
   - At 55ns, `q` increments to `5` on the rising edge of the clock.
   - At 65ns, `q` increments to `6`.
   - At 75ns, `q` wraps around to `0`.
   - At 85ns, `q` increments to `1`.

3. **Logic Deduction**:
   - When `a` is `1`, `q` is held constant at `4`.
   - When `a` is `0`, `q` increments by `1` on each rising edge of the clock, wrapping around after reaching `7` (since `q` is 3 bits).

4. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Use a 3-bit register for `q`.
   - On each rising edge of the clock, check the value of `a`.
   - If `a` is `1`, set `q` to `4`.
   - If `a` is `0`, increment `q` by `1`.

5. **Coding Conventions**:
   - Use `logic` for all signals.
   - Use an `always_ff` block for sequential logic.
   - Initialize `q` to `0` for simulation purposes.
