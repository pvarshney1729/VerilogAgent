<REASONING>
To determine the logic implemented by the module, we need to analyze the given truth table. The truth table provides the output `q` for all combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

From the truth table:
- `q` is `1` when:
  - `c` is `1` (regardless of `a`, `b`, `d`)
  - `b` is `1` and `c` is `0` (regardless of `a`, `d`)

This can be expressed in a logical equation:
- `q = c + (b & ~c)`

This equation can be simplified further:
- `q = c | b`

This means `q` is `1` if either `c` is `1` or `b` is `1`.

Now, let's implement this logic in Verilog. We will use an `assign` statement for combinational logic, as it is more appropriate for this simple logic expression.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);
    // Implement the logic derived from the truth table
    assign q = c | b;
endmodule
[DONE]
