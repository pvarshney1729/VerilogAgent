<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that behaves like a wire. This means the output `out` should directly reflect the input `in` without any modification or delay. Since the module is supposed to act as a wire, there is no need for any internal logic, flip-flops, or reset signals. The simplest way to achieve this is by using an `assign` statement to directly connect the input to the output. This approach adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, as it does not require any always blocks or additional logic.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);
    // Directly connect input to output
    assign out = in;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
