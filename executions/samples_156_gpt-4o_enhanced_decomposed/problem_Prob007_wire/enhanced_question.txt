Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit [0] (1-bit input, least significant bit)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: bit [0] (1-bit output, least significant bit)

Functional Description:
The TopModule shall function as a direct wire connection between the input and output ports. The output 'out' shall reflect the value of the input 'in' at all times.

Behavioral Characteristics:
- The module operates as combinational logic, meaning the output is continuously driven by the input without any clock cycles or sequential elements involved.
- There are no internal registers or flip-flops; thus, no reset conditions or initial values are applicable.

Edge Cases:
- The module shall handle all valid input states (0 or 1) without any undefined behavior.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the input 'in'. Any change in 'in' will immediately affect 'out'.
