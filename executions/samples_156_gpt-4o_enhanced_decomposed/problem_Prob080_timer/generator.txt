<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a down-counter that can be loaded with a 10-bit value and decrements on each clock cycle. The counter should stop decrementing once it reaches zero and should only be reloaded when the `load` signal is asserted. The output `tc` should indicate when the counter has reached zero.

1. **Inputs and Outputs**: We have a clock `clk`, a load signal `load`, a 10-bit input `data`, and a 1-bit output `tc`.

2. **Counter Logic**: 
   - When `load` is high, the counter should be loaded with the value from `data`.
   - When `load` is low, the counter should decrement by 1 if it is not already zero.
   - If the counter reaches zero, it should remain at zero until reloaded.

3. **Output Logic**: 
   - The `tc` output should be high when the counter is zero.

4. **Sequential Logic**: 
   - The counter operation should be synchronized with the positive edge of the clock.

5. **Single D Flip-Flop**: 
   - The problem statement mentions using a single D flip-flop, which implies that the counter should be implemented using a single register.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic load,
    input logic [9:0] data,
    output logic tc
);

    logic [9:0] counter;

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            counter <= data;
        end else if (counter != 10'b0) begin
            counter <= counter - 1;
        end
    end

    assign tc = (counter == 10'b0);

endmodule
