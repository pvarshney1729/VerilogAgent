        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - load: 1-bit input (load signal, active high)\n  - data: 10-bit input (data to load into the counter, bit[0] is the least significant bit)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - tc: 1-bit output (terminal count signal, active high when the counter reaches zero)\n\nFunctionality:\nThe TopModule implements a countdown timer using a down-counter. The timer counts down from a specified number of clock cycles, indicated by the 10-bit input data, and asserts the terminal count signal (tc) when the countdown reaches zero.\n\nOperational Description:\n1. On the positive edge of clk:\n   - If load = 1:\n     - Load the internal counter with the value from the 10-bit data input. This operation is asynchronous and can occur at any time, including during an active countdown.\n   - If load = 0:\n     - Decrement the internal counter by 1.\n     - The output signal tc will be asserted (set to 1) when the internal counter reaches zero. Once the counter reaches zero, it will remain at zero (stop counting) until a new value is loaded via the load signal.\n\nCounter Behavior:\n- The internal counter is initialized to zero upon reset (reset state).\n- The counter will not count below zero; it will remain at zero once it reaches that state until a new value is loaded.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The module contains a single D flip-flop to hold the current count value.\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the counter can be loaded with any value from 0 to 1023 (the range of a 10-bit number).\n- The tc output should only be asserted when the counter transitions from 1 to 0.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module does not specify a reset input; therefore, the initial state of the counter is assumed to be zero.\n                    "
