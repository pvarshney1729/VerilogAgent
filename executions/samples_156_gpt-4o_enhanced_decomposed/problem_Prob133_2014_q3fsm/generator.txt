<REASONING>
To implement the FSM as described, we need to define the states and transitions clearly. The FSM starts in state A and remains there as long as `s` is 0. When `s` becomes 1, it transitions to state B. In state B, the FSM needs to monitor the input `w` for three clock cycles and count how many times `w` is 1. If `w` is 1 exactly twice in these three cycles, the output `z` should be set to 1 in the next cycle; otherwise, `z` should be 0.

The FSM can be implemented with the following states:
- `STATE_A`: Initial state, waiting for `s` to become 1.
- `STATE_B`: Counting occurrences of `w` being 1 over three cycles.

We will use a counter to track the number of cycles and another counter to track the number of times `w` is 1. After three cycles, we will determine the value of `z` based on the count of `w`.

The synchronous reset will ensure that the FSM starts in `STATE_A` and all counters are reset to zero.
