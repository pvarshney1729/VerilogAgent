When reset is asserted, the FSM transitions to state A.\n\nClocking:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nImplementation Guidelines:\n- Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and the state flip-flops.\n- The output z should be derived from the current state of the FSM. It can be implemented using either continuous assignment statements or an always block, based on the designer's discretion.\n- Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have explicitly defined initial values.\n                    "
