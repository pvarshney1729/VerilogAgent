Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clock: 1-bit input (rising edge triggered)
  - a: 1-bit input
- Output Ports:
  - p: 1-bit output
  - q: 1-bit output

Description:
The TopModule implements a sequential circuit. The behavior of the circuit is defined by the following timing diagram, which indicates the relationship between the clock, input 'a', and outputs 'p' and 'q'. 

Timing Diagram:
- The clock signal is sampled on the rising edge.
- The outputs 'p' and 'q' are determined based on the state of the input 'a' and the previous state of the outputs.

Initial Conditions:
- At time 0ns, the outputs 'p' and 'q' are undefined (x).
- The module should initialize all registers to a known state upon reset (if applicable).

Behavior:
- The outputs 'p' and 'q' should be defined based on the following conditions observed in the timing diagram:
  - When clock transitions from low to high, the output 'p' and 'q' should be updated based on the current value of 'a' and the previous state of 'p' and 'q'.
  - The output 'p' should reflect the state of 'a' after a certain number of clock cycles.
  - The output 'q' should be a function of the previous state of 'p' and the current state of 'a'.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the outputs 'p' and 'q' do not change during the clock low period.
- Handle transitions of 'a' appropriately, especially when 'a' changes state during the clock high period.

Reset Behavior:
- If a reset signal is introduced, specify whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and define the reset state for all registers.

Signal Dependencies:
- Clearly define any dependencies between the input 'a' and the outputs 'p' and 'q' to avoid race conditions.

Note: The implementation should be verified against the provided timing diagram to ensure correctness.
