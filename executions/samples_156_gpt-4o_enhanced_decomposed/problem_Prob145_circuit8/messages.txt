Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clock: 1-bit input (rising edge triggered)\n  - a: 1-bit input\n- Output Ports:\n  - p: 1-bit output\n  - q: 1-bit output\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule implements a sequential circuit. The behavior of the circuit is defined by the following timing diagram, which indicates the relationship between the clock, input 'a', and outputs 'p' and 'q'. \n\nTiming Diagram:\n- The clock signal is sampled on the rising edge.\n- The outputs 'p' and 'q' are determined based on the state of the input 'a' and the previous state of the outputs.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- At time 0ns, the outputs 'p' and 'q' are undefined (x).\n- The module should initialize all registers to a known state upon reset (if applicable).\n\nBehavior:\n- The outputs 'p' and 'q' should be defined based on the following conditions observed in the timing diagram:\n  - When clock transitions from low to high, the output 'p' and 'q' should be updated based on the current value of 'a' and the previous state of 'p' and 'q'.\n  - The output 'p' should reflect the state of 'a' after a certain number of clock cycles.\n  - The output 'q' should be a function of the previous state of 'p' and the current state of 'a'.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the outputs 'p' and 'q' do not change during the clock low period.\n- Handle transitions of 'a' appropriately, especially when 'a' changes state during the clock high period.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- If a reset signal is introduced, specify whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and define the reset state for all registers.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- Clearly define any dependencies between the input 'a' and the outputs 'p' and 'q' to avoid race conditions.\n\nNote: The implementation should be verified against the provided timing diagram to ensure correctness.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
