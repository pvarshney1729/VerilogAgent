Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a;  // 1-bit input
  - input wire b;  // 1-bit input
  - input wire c;  // 1-bit input
  - input wire d;  // 1-bit input
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out;   // 1-bit output
  - output wire out_n; // 1-bit inverted output

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit consisting of two layers of gates. 

Layer 1:
- Two AND gates are utilized:
  - AND Gate 1: Takes inputs from 'a' and 'b'. 
  - AND Gate 2: Takes inputs from 'c' and 'd'.

Layer 2:
- An OR gate combines the outputs of the two AND gates. The output of this OR gate is assigned to the output port 'out'.

Inversion:
- The output 'out_n' is the logical NOT of 'out', effectively providing the inverted output.

Signal Connections:
- Intermediate wires (to be named as per design choice) will connect the outputs of the AND gates to the input of the OR gate. 
- Ensure that each wire is driven by exactly one source (the output of a gate) and can feed multiple inputs.

Reset and Initialization:
- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all combinations of the input signals 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', producing the correct outputs based on standard logical operations.

Note: Ensure that the implementation adheres to the specified input and output widths, and that all signal dependencies are clearly defined.
