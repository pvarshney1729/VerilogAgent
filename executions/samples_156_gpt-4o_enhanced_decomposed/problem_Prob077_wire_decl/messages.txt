Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire b;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire c;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire d;  // 1-bit input\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out;   // 1-bit output\n  - output wire out_n; // 1-bit inverted output\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit consisting of two layers of gates. \n\nLayer 1:\n- Two AND gates are utilized:\n  - AND Gate 1: Takes inputs from 'a' and 'b'. \n  - AND Gate 2: Takes inputs from 'c' and 'd'.\n\nLayer 2:\n- An OR gate combines the outputs of the two AND gates. The output of this OR gate is assigned to the output port 'out'.\n\nInversion:\n- The output 'out_n' is the logical NOT of 'out', effectively providing the inverted output.\n\nSignal Connections:\n- Intermediate wires (to be named as per design choice) will connect the outputs of the AND gates to the input of the OR gate. \n- Ensure that each wire is driven by exactly one source (the output of a gate) and can feed multiple inputs.\n\nReset and Initialization:\n- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all combinations of the input signals 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', producing the correct outputs based on standard logical operations.\n\nNote: Ensure that the implementation adheres to the specified input and output widths, and that all signal dependencies are clearly defined.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
