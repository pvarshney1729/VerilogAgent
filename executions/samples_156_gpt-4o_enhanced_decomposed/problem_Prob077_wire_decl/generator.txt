<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to follow the given specifications and guidelines. The module has four inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and two outputs (`out`, `out_n`). The circuit consists of two layers of logic gates:

1. **First Layer**: Two AND gates.
   - The first AND gate takes inputs `a` and `b`.
   - The second AND gate takes inputs `c` and `d`.

2. **Second Layer**: An OR gate.
   - The OR gate takes the outputs of the two AND gates as its inputs and produces the output `out`.

3. **Inverted Output**: The output `out_n` is the logical NOT of `out`.

We will use two intermediate wires to connect the outputs of the AND gates to the inputs of the OR gate. The output of the OR gate will directly drive the `out` signal, and the `out_n` will be the inverted value of `out`.

According to the coding conventions, we will declare all ports and signals as `logic`. We will use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) for combinational logic, as there is no need for an always block in this purely combinational circuit.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    input  logic c,
    input  logic d,
    output logic out,
    output logic out_n
);

    // Intermediate wires for AND gate outputs
    logic and1_out;
    logic and2_out;

    // AND gates
    assign and1_out = a & b;
    assign and2_out = c & d;

    // OR gate
    assign out = and1_out | and2_out;

    // NOT gate for inverted output
    assign out_n = ~out;

endmodule
[DONE]
