<REASONING>
The given waveform suggests that the output `q` changes state based on the input `a` and the clock `clk`. Initially, `q` is undefined, but it becomes `1` when `a` is `0` and remains `1` until `a` becomes `1`. When `a` is `1`, `q` transitions to `0` on the next rising edge of `clk` and stays `0` as long as `a` remains `1`.

This behavior can be implemented using a D flip-flop with a simple logic: `q` is set to `1` when `a` is `0` and reset to `0` when `a` is `1`. This can be achieved by using a synchronous reset mechanism where `q` is set to `1` when `a` is `0` and reset to `0` when `a` is `1`.

            q <= 1'b1;
        end else begin
            q <= 1'b0;
