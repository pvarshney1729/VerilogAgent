<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to concatenate the six 5-bit input vectors (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`) into a single 30-bit vector. Then, we append two additional bits set to `1` to form a 32-bit vector. This 32-bit vector is then split into four 8-bit output vectors (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`). 

The concatenation of the input vectors and the two additional bits can be done using the Verilog concatenation operator `{}`. The resulting 32-bit vector is then divided into four 8-bit segments, which are assigned to the outputs `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Since this operation is purely combinational, we will use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) to define the outputs. There is no need for an `always` block or a clock signal, as there is no sequential logic or state to maintain.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [4:0] a,
    input  logic [4:0] b,
    input  logic [4:0] c,
    input  logic [4:0] d,
    input  logic [4:0] e,
    input  logic [4:0] f,
    output logic [7:0] w,
    output logic [7:0] x,
    output logic [7:0] y,
    output logic [7:0] z
);

    // Concatenate inputs and two additional 1 bits, then split into outputs
    assign {w, x, y, z} = {a, b, c, d, e, f, 2'b11};

endmodule
