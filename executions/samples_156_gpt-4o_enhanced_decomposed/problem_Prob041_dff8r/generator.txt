<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a module with an 8-bit input `d` and an 8-bit output `q`. The module will use 8 D flip-flops to store the value of `d` on the rising edge of the clock `clk`. The flip-flops should have an active high synchronous reset, which means that when `reset` is high, the output `q` should be set to zero on the next rising edge of `clk`. 

The synchronous reset is implemented inside the always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of `clk`. The reset condition is checked first, and if `reset` is high, `q` is set to zero. Otherwise, `q` is assigned the value of `d`. 

We will use the `logic` type for all ports and internal signals as per the coding conventions. The always block will not include `reset` in the sensitivity list since it is a synchronous reset.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    input logic [7:0] d,
    output logic [7:0] q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 8'b00000000; // Set q to zero on reset
        end else begin
            q <= d; // Transfer input d to output q
        end
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
