Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - d: 8-bit input (data input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: 8-bit output (data output, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)

Functional Description:
- The module shall instantiate 8 D flip-flops (DFFs) that are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- Each DFF shall have an active high synchronous reset. When reset is asserted (high), the output of each DFF (q[i]) shall be set to '0' (zero).
- When reset is not asserted (low), the output of each DFF shall follow the corresponding input data (d[i]) on the rising edge of clk.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous, meaning that the reset condition is evaluated on the rising edge of clk.
- All DFF outputs (q[7:0]) shall initialize to '0' when reset is asserted.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q[i] of each DFF is dependent on the corresponding input d[i] and the clk signal.
- Ensure that there are no race conditions between the reset and data input signals.

Edge Cases:
- When reset is asserted during a clock cycle, the outputs q[i] should immediately reflect the reset state (zero) on the next rising edge of clk.
- If reset is deasserted while clk is high, the outputs should remain unchanged until the next rising edge of clk.

Bit Indexing:
- The bits of the input d and output q are indexed from 0 to 7, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).
