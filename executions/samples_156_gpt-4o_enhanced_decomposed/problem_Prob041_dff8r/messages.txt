Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)\n  - d: 8-bit input (data input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 8-bit output (data output, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module shall instantiate 8 D flip-flops (DFFs) that are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- Each DFF shall have an active high synchronous reset. When reset is asserted (high), the output of each DFF (q[i]) shall be set to '0' (zero).\n- When reset is not asserted (low), the output of each DFF shall follow the corresponding input data (d[i]) on the rising edge of clk.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous, meaning that the reset condition is evaluated on the rising edge of clk.\n- All DFF outputs (q[7:0]) shall initialize to '0' when reset is asserted.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q[i] of each DFF is dependent on the corresponding input d[i] and the clk signal.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions between the reset and data input signals.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When reset is asserted during a clock cycle, the outputs q[i] should immediately reflect the reset state (zero) on the next rising edge of clk.\n- If reset is deasserted while clk is high, the outputs should remain unchanged until the next rising edge of clk.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The bits of the input d and output q are indexed from 0 to 7, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

All DFFs should be triggered by the\npositive edge of clk.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
