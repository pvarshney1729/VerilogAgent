        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)\n  - x: 1-bit input (data signal)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - z: 1-bit output (result of the NOR gate)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following behavior:\n\n1. The input signal 'x' is processed through three distinct two-input logic gates: \n   - XOR Gate\n   - AND Gate\n   - OR Gate\n\n2. Each gate's output is connected to the input of a D flip-flop. The D flip-flops are defined as follows:\n   - DFF1: Input from XOR gate\n   - DFF2: Input from AND gate\n   - DFF3: Input from OR gate\n\n3. The outputs of the D flip-flops (DFF1_out, DFF2_out, DFF3_out) are used as follows:\n   - The second input of the XOR gate is connected to DFF1_out.\n   - The second input of the AND gate is connected to the complemented output of DFF2 (i.e., ~DFF2_out).\n   - The second input of the OR gate is connected to the complemented output of DFF3 (i.e., ~DFF3_out).\n\n4. The outputs of the three D flip-flops are fed into a three-input NOR gate, which produces the output 'z':\n   - z = ~(DFF1_out | DFF2_out | DFF3_out)\n\n5. Reset Conditions:\n   - All D flip-flops are initialized to a reset state of 0 (DFF1_out = 0, DFF2_out = 0, DFF3_out = 0) before the FSM begins operation.\n   - The reset is assumed to be synchronous with respect to the clock signal.\n\n6. Timing:\n   - All sequential logic (D flip-flops) is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (clk).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The behavior of the FSM should be defined for all possible input combinations of 'x' and the states of the D flip-flops.\n- Ensure that the output 'z' is correctly computed based on the defined logic gates and the states of the D flip-flops.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'z' is dependent on the outputs of the D flip-flops, which in turn depend on the input 'x' and the previous states of the flip-flops.\n\nPrecedence of Operations:\n- The logic operations (XOR, AND, OR) must be evaluated before the NOR operation to ensure correct output computation.\n\nPotential Race Conditions:\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions between the clock edge triggering and the evaluation of the logic gates.\n                    "
