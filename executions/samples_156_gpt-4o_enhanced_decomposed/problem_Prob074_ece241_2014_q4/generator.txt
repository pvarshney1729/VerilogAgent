<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) that processes the input `x` through three different gates (XOR, AND, OR) and then stores the results in D flip-flops. The outputs of these flip-flops are then fed into a three-input NOR gate to produce the output `z`.

1. **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has three ports: `clk` (clock), `x` (input), and `z` (output).

2. **D Flip-Flops**: We need three D flip-flops, each initialized to zero. These flip-flops will store the results of the XOR, AND, and OR operations.

3. **Gate Operations**:
   - XOR: The first input is `x`, and the second input is the output of its corresponding flip-flop.
   - AND: The first input is `x`, and the second input is the complement of its corresponding flip-flop's output.
   - OR: The first input is `x`, and the second input is the complement of its corresponding flip-flop's output.

4. **NOR Gate**: The outputs of the three flip-flops are fed into a three-input NOR gate to produce the output `z`.

5. **Clock Edge Triggering**: The flip-flops are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

6. **Initialization**: The flip-flops are initialized to zero, which can be done using an initial block for simulation purposes.
