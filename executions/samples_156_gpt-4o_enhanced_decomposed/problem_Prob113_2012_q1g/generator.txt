<REASONING>
To implement the function `f` based on the given Karnaugh map, we need to derive the minimized Boolean expression. The Karnaugh map provided is a 4-variable map with variables `x[3]`, `x[2]`, `x[1]`, and `x[0]`. We will identify the groups of 1s to simplify the expression.

From the Karnaugh map:
- The first row has 1s at positions (0,0) and (0,3), which corresponds to `x[2]'x[3]'x[0]' + x[2]'x[3]'x[0]`.
- The third row has 1s at positions (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2), which corresponds to `x[2]x[3]x[0]' + x[2]x[3]x[1]' + x[2]x[3]x[1]`.
- The fourth row has 1s at positions (3,0), (3,1), and (3,3), which corresponds to `x[2]'x[3]x[0]' + x[2]'x[3]x[1]' + x[2]'x[3]x[0]`.

By grouping and simplifying these terms, we can derive the minimized Boolean expression for `f`:
- `f = x[2]'x[3]'x[0] + x[2]x[3] + x[2]'x[3]x[1]'`

Now, we will implement this logic in Verilog using the specified coding conventions.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [3:0] x,
    output logic f
);
    always @(*) begin
        f = (~x[2] & ~x[3] & x[0]) | (x[2] & x[3]) | (~x[2] & x[3] & ~x[1]);
    end
endmodule
[DONE]
