Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - x: 4-bit vector (bit[3:0]), where:
    - x[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)
    - x[3] is the most significant bit (MSB)

- Output Ports:
  - f: 1-bit output

Functionality:
The module implements the logic function f as defined by the following Karnaugh map:

             x[0] x[1]
x[2] x[3]  00  01  11  10
  00     |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |
  01     |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
  11     |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |
  10     |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 |

Truth Table:
The truth table corresponding to the Karnaugh map is as follows:

| x[3] | x[2] | x[1] | x[0] | f |
|------|------|------|------|---|
|  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   | 1 |
|  0   |  0   |  0   |  1   | 0 |
|  0   |  0   |  1   |  0   | 0 |
|  0   |  0   |  1   |  1   | 1 |
|  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   | 0 |
|  0   |  1   |  0   |  1   | 0 |
|  0   |  1   |  1   |  0   | 1 |
|  0   |  1   |  1   |  1   | 1 |
|  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   | 1 |
|  1   |  0   |  0   |  1   | 0 |
|  1   |  0   |  1   |  0   | 0 |
|  1   |  0   |  1   |  1   | 0 |
|  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   | 0 |
|  1   |  1   |  0   |  1   | 1 |
|  1   |  1   |  1   |  0   | 1 |
|  1   |  1   |  1   |  1   | 0 |

Implementation Notes:
- The output f is a combinational logic output based on the values of the input vector x.
- Ensure that all signal dependencies are clearly defined, and there are no race conditions in the logic.
- The module does not require any synchronous or asynchronous resets, as it is purely combinational.
