Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[3:0] (4 bits, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB))

- Output Ports:
  - out_and: bit (1 bit output representing the result of a 4-input AND operation)
  - out_or: bit (1 bit output representing the result of a 4-input OR operation)
  - out_xor: bit (1 bit output representing the result of a 4-input XOR operation)

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit that processes the 4-bit input 'in' to produce three 1-bit outputs:
1. out_and: This output is the logical AND of all four input bits (in[3] AND in[2] AND in[1] AND in[0]).
2. out_or: This output is the logical OR of all four input bits (in[3] OR in[2] OR in[1] OR in[0]).
3. out_xor: This output is the logical XOR of all four input bits (in[3] XOR in[2] XOR in[1] XOR in[0]).

Behavioral Characteristics:
- The outputs are updated based on the current values of the input 'in' without any clocking mechanism, as this is a purely combinational circuit.
- There are no edge cases or input boundaries specified that would affect the output behavior.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module, as it is purely combinational and does not contain any state-holding elements.

Signal Dependencies:
- The outputs depend directly on the current values of the input bits. There are no additional dependencies or precedence of operations to consider.
