Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (positive edge-triggered clock signal)
  - in: 1-bit input (data signal)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (data signal from the D flip-flop)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a D flip-flop that is triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal. The D flip-flop's input is derived from a two-input XOR gate. The XOR gate takes two inputs: the current value of the input signal 'in' and the current output of the D flip-flop, 'out'.

Signal Definitions:
- The output 'out' of the D flip-flop is defined as the current state of the flip-flop.
- The XOR operation is defined as follows:
  - XOR(in, out) = (in AND NOT(out)) OR (NOT(in) AND out)

Sequential Logic:
- The D flip-flop is positive edge-triggered, meaning it captures the input value at the rising edge of the clk signal.
- There is no reset mechanism implemented in this module, and the initial state of the flip-flop is undefined.

Edge Case Behavior:
- The behavior of the module is not defined for the initial state of the flip-flop. It is recommended to specify an initial condition for the flip-flop to ensure predictable behavior upon the first clock cycle.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals are treated as single-bit values, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Timing Relationships:
- The output 'out' will be updated on the rising edge of clk based on the result of the XOR operation.

Potential Race Conditions:
- Ensure that the input 'in' is stable before the rising edge of clk to avoid any race conditions during the flip-flop's operation.
