        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)\n  - in: 1-bit input (data stream)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - disc: 1-bit output (signal to indicate a bit needs to be discarded)\n  - flag: 1-bit output (signal to indicate the beginning/end of a frame)\n  - err: 1-bit output (signal to indicate an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a synchronous HDLC framing mechanism that decodes a continuous bit stream of data to identify specific bit patterns that signify frame boundaries and error conditions. The following sequences are recognized:\n\n1. **Disc Signal (disc)**: \n   - Output is asserted when the input sequence 0111110 is detected, indicating that the next bit should be discarded.\n\n2. **Flag Signal (flag)**: \n   - Output is asserted when the input sequence 01111110 is detected, indicating the start or end of a frame.\n\n3. **Error Signal (err)**: \n   - Output is asserted when 7 or more consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111111...) are detected, indicating an error condition.\n\nState Machine Behavior:\n- The module shall utilize a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to recognize the specified sequences.\n- The FSM shall reset to a state that behaves as if the last input was 0 when the reset signal is asserted.\n- The reset signal is active high and synchronous to the clock.\n- The output signals (disc, flag, err) shall be asserted for one complete clock cycle, beginning on the clock cycle immediately following the detection of the respective condition.\n\nClocking:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (clk).\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, all output signals (disc, flag, err) shall be initialized to 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle input boundaries and ensure that the detection of sequences does not lead to race conditions or undefined behavior.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The input data stream is treated as a continuous sequence of bits, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit (LSB).\n                    "
