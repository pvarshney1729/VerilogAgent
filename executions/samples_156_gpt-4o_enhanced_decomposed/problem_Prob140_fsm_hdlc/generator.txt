<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) for detecting specific bit patterns in a synchronous HDLC framing system, we need to define states that represent the number of consecutive '1's seen in the input stream. The FSM will transition between these states based on the input bit and will assert the appropriate output signals (`disc`, `flag`, `err`) based on the detected patterns.

1. **State Definitions**: 
   - `S0`: Initial state or after a '0' is seen.
   - `S1` to `S5`: States representing 1 to 5 consecutive '1's.
   - `S6`: State representing 6 consecutive '1's, which is a potential flag.
   - `S7`: State representing 7 consecutive '1's, which indicates an error.

2. **State Transitions**:
   - From `S0`, if '1' is received, move to `S1`. If '0', stay in `S0`.
   - From `S1` to `S5`, move to the next state on '1', or reset to `S0` on '0'.
   - From `S5`, if '1' is received, move to `S6`. If '0', move to `S0`.
   - From `S6`, if '1' is received, move to `S7` (error). If '0', move to `S0` and assert `flag`.
   - From `S7`, stay in `S7` on '1' (error persists), or move to `S0` on '0'.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - `disc` is asserted when transitioning from `S5` to `S0` on a '0'.
   - `flag` is asserted when transitioning from `S6` to `S0` on a '0'.
   - `err` is asserted when in `S7`.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM should reset to `S0` on a synchronous reset signal.

5. **Implementation**: Use a case statement within an always block triggered by the clock to handle state transitions and output logic.
