Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - in: 1-bit input (data stream)

- Output Ports:
  - disc: 1-bit output (signal to indicate a bit needs to be discarded)
  - flag: 1-bit output (signal to indicate the beginning/end of a frame)
  - err: 1-bit output (signal to indicate an error due to 7 or more consecutive 1s)

Functional Description:
The module implements a synchronous HDLC framing mechanism that decodes a continuous bit stream of data to identify specific bit patterns that signify frame boundaries and error conditions. The following sequences are recognized:

1. **Disc Signal (disc)**: 
   - Output is asserted when the input sequence 0111110 is detected, indicating that the next bit should be discarded.

2. **Flag Signal (flag)**: 
   - Output is asserted when the input sequence 01111110 is detected, indicating the start or end of a frame.

3. **Error Signal (err)**: 
   - Output is asserted when 7 or more consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111111...) are detected, indicating an error condition.

State Machine Behavior:
- The module shall utilize a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to recognize the specified sequences.
- The FSM shall reset to a state that behaves as if the last input was 0 when the reset signal is asserted.
- The reset signal is active high and synchronous to the clock.
- The output signals (disc, flag, err) shall be asserted for one complete clock cycle, beginning on the clock cycle immediately following the detection of the respective condition.

Clocking:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (clk).

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, all output signals (disc, flag, err) shall be initialized to 0.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle input boundaries and ensure that the detection of sequences does not lead to race conditions or undefined behavior.

Bit Indexing:
- The input data stream is treated as a continuous sequence of bits, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit (LSB).
