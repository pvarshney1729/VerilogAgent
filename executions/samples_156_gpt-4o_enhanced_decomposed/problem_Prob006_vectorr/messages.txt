        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port:\n  - Name: in\n  - Width: 8 bits\n  - Description: This port accepts an 8-bit input signal. The least significant bit (LSB) is referred to as in[0] and the most significant bit (MSB) is referred to as in[7].\n\n- Output Port:\n  - Name: out\n  - Width: 8 bits\n  - Description: This port outputs an 8-bit signal, where the LSB is out[0] and the MSB is out[7].\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module shall reverse the bit ordering of the input signal 'in' and assign the reversed result to the output signal 'out'. Specifically, the output shall be defined as follows:\n  - out[0] = in[7]\n  - out[1] = in[6]\n  - out[2] = in[5]\n  - out[3] = in[4]\n  - out[4] = in[3]\n  - out[5] = in[2]\n  - out[6] = in[1]\n  - out[7] = in[0]\n\nBehavioral Characteristics:\n- The operation is combinational, meaning the output 'out' is immediately updated based on the current value of the input 'in' without any clock cycle dependencies.\n- There are no asynchronous or synchronous resets defined for this module.\n- The module does not have any initial values for the output; it will reflect the reversed input immediately upon receiving a valid input.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible 8-bit input values, including the cases where the input is all zeros (in = 8'b00000000) or all ones (in = 8'b11111111), ensuring that the output reflects the correct reversed bit order in these scenarios.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in  (8 bits)\n - output out (8 bits)\n\nThe module should reverse the bit ordering of the input port and write\nthe result to the output port.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
