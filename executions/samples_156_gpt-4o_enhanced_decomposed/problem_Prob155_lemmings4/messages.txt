Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (active high asynchronous reset)\n  - bump_left: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the left)\n  - bump_right: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the right)\n  - ground: 1-bit input (indicates presence of ground, 1 = present, 0 = absent)\n  - dig: 1-bit input (indicates request to dig, 1 = dig, 0 = do not dig)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - walk_left: 1-bit output (1 = walking left, 0 = not walking left)\n  - walk_right: 1-bit output (1 = walking right, 0 = not walking right)\n  - aaah: 1-bit output (1 = falling, 0 = not falling)\n  - digging: 1-bit output (1 = digging, 0 = not digging)\n\nState Description:\nThe Lemming can be in one of the following states:\n1. Walking Left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0)\n2. Walking Right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1)\n3. Falling (aaah = 1)\n4. Digging (digging = 1)\n5. Splattered (all outputs = 0)\n\nState Transition Logic:\n- The Lemming will switch directions based on bump inputs:\n  - If bump_left = 1, the Lemming will walk right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1).\n  - If bump_right = 1, the Lemming will walk left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0).\n  - If both bump_left and bump_right are 1, the Lemming will switch directions according to the bump precedence.\n\n- The Lemming will fall if ground = 0:\n  - When ground transitions from 1 to 0, the Lemming enters the falling state (aaah = 1).\n  - When ground transitions back to 1, the Lemming resumes walking in the last direction before falling.\n\n- Digging behavior:\n  - The Lemming can dig only when ground = 1 and not falling (aaah = 0).\n  - Digging will continue until ground = 0, at which point the Lemming will fall.\n  - If the Lemming is falling or there is no ground, the dig input is ignored.\n\nPrecedence of Actions:\n1. Falling (highest precedence)\n2. Digging\n3. Direction Change (bumping)\n\nSplattering Condition:\n- If the Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles and then hits the ground, it will splatter:\n  - All outputs (walk_left, walk_right, aaah, digging) will be set to 0.\n  - The Lemming remains in the splattered state until areset is activated.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The areset signal is a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that initializes the Lemming to the walking left state (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0, digging = 0).\n\nClocking:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The Lemming does not splatter while in mid-air; splattering occurs only upon hitting the ground after falling for too long.\n- The Lemming's behavior is defined for all possible combinations of input signals, ensuring clarity in state transitions and output conditions.\n                    "
