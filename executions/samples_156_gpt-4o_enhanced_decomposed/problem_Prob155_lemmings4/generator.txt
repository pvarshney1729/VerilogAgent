<REASONING>
To implement the Lemming behavior as described, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states:

1. **WALK_LEFT**: The Lemming is walking left.
2. **WALK_RIGHT**: The Lemming is walking right.
3. **FALL_LEFT**: The Lemming is falling after walking left.
4. **FALL_RIGHT**: The Lemming is falling after walking right.
5. **DIG_LEFT**: The Lemming is digging while walking left.
6. **DIG_RIGHT**: The Lemming is digging while walking right.
7. **SPLATTER**: The Lemming has splattered and all outputs are 0.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the inputs: `bump_left`, `bump_right`, `ground`, and `dig`. The priority of actions is:
- Falling (when `ground` is 0) has the highest priority.
- Digging (when `dig` is 1 and `ground` is 1) has the next priority.
- Switching directions (when bumped) has the lowest priority.

The FSM also needs to count the number of clock cycles the Lemming is falling to determine if it should splatter. If the Lemming falls for more than 20 cycles, it transitions to the `SPLATTER` state when it hits the ground.

The asynchronous reset (`areset`) initializes the FSM to the `WALK_LEFT` state.
