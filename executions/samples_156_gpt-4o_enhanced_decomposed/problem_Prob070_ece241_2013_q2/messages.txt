Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input\n  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input\n  - input logic c;  // 1-bit input\n  - input logic d;  // 1-bit input\n- Output Ports:\n  - output logic out_sop;  // 1-bit output for sum-of-products\n  - output logic out_pos;   // 1-bit output for product-of-sums\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit that processes four 1-bit inputs (a, b, c, d) to generate two outputs: out_sop and out_pos. The outputs are defined based on specific input combinations corresponding to decimal values.\n\nInput Conditions:\n- The output out_sop should be high (logic-1) when the input combination corresponds to the decimal values 2 (0010), 7 (0111), or 15 (1111).\n- The output out_sop should be low (logic-0) when the input combination corresponds to the decimal values 0 (0000), 1 (0001), 4 (0100), 5 (0101), 6 (0110), 9 (1001), 10 (1010), 13 (1101), or 14 (1110).\n- The input combinations for the decimal values 3 (0011), 8 (1000), 11 (1011), and 12 (1100) will not occur in this system.\n\nOutput Definitions:\n- The output out_sop must be expressed in minimum sum-of-products (SOP) form.\n- The output out_pos must be expressed in minimum product-of-sums (POS) form.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The inputs are indexed as follows: \n  - a = bit[0] (LSB)\n  - b = bit[1]\n  - c = bit[2]\n  - d = bit[3] (MSB)\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that all logic operations are clearly defined to avoid race conditions.\n- The module should be implemented as purely combinational logic with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
