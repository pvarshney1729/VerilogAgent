Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[255:0] (256 bits) - This is a packed vector containing 256 individual 1-bit inputs.
  - sel: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - This signal selects one of the 256 inputs. The value of sel ranges from 0 to 255.

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit (1 bit) - This is the selected output based on the sel input.

Functionality:
- The module implements a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.
- The selection logic is defined as follows:
  - When sel = 0, out = in[0]
  - When sel = 1, out = in[1]
  - When sel = 2, out = in[2]
  - ...
  - When sel = 255, out = in[255]

Behavior:
- The output out will reflect the value of the selected input in based on the sel signal.
- The module should handle all values of sel within the range of 0 to 255. If sel is outside this range, the behavior is undefined.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the selection logic is combinational.
- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets defined for this module.
- The output out should be driven by the selected input in without any additional delay or timing constraints.
