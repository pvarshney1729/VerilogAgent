<REASONING>
To implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer, we need to select one bit from a 256-bit input vector based on an 8-bit selection signal. The selection signal `sel` will determine which bit from the input vector `in` is routed to the output `out`. Since this is purely combinational logic, we will use an `always @(*)` block to describe the behavior of the multiplexer. The `sel` signal will be used as an index to access the appropriate bit from the `in` vector. We will ensure that the code adheres to the specified coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and not explicitly specifying the sensitivity list in the `always` block.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [255:0] in,  // 256-bit input vector
    input logic [7:0] sel,   // 8-bit selection signal
    output logic out         // 1-bit output
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = in[sel];  // Select the bit from 'in' based on 'sel'
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
