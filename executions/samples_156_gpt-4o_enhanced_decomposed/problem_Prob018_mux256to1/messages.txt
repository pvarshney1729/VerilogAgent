Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - in: bit[255:0] (256 bits) - This is a packed vector containing 256 individual 1-bit inputs.\n  - sel: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - This signal selects one of the 256 inputs. The value of sel ranges from 0 to 255.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: bit (1 bit) - This is the selected output based on the sel input.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.\n- The selection logic is defined as follows:\n  - When sel = 0, out = in[0]\n  - When sel = 1, out = in[1]\n  - When sel = 2, out = in[2]\n  - ...\n  - When sel = 255, out = in[255]\n\nBehavior:\n- The output out will reflect the value of the selected input in based on the sel signal.\n- The module should handle all values of sel within the range of 0 to 255. If sel is outside this range, the behavior is undefined.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that the selection logic is combinational.\n- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets defined for this module.\n- The output out should be driven by the selected input in without any additional delay or timing constraints.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
