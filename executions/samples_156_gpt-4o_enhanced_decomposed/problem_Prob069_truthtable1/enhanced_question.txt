Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire x3: 1-bit input representing the most significant bit (MSB).
  - input wire x2: 1-bit input representing the middle bit.
  - input wire x1: 1-bit input representing the least significant bit (LSB).
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire f: 1-bit output representing the result of the combinational logic.

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following truth table:

| x3 | x2 | x1 | f |
|----|----|----|---|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0 |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 0 |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 1 |
| 0  | 1  | 1  | 1 |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 0 |
| 1  | 0  | 1  | 1 |
| 1  | 1  | 0  | 0 |
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 1 |

Implementation Notes:
- The output f is determined solely by the current values of inputs x3, x2, and x1.
- The circuit is purely combinational; there are no sequential elements or clock cycles involved.
- Ensure that all input signals are treated as active high.
- The output f should be driven to a valid logic level based on the specified truth table for all combinations of inputs.
