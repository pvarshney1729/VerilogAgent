<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to detect any edge (rising or falling) for each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in`. The output `anyedge` should be set to 1 for a bit position if there is a transition from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 in the corresponding bit of `in` from one clock cycle to the next.

1. **Input and Output Declaration**: The module will have an 8-bit input `in` and an 8-bit output `anyedge`. The clock signal `clk` is also an input.

2. **Edge Detection Logic**: For each bit in the input vector, we need to store the previous state of the bit to compare it with the current state. This requires a register to hold the previous state of the input vector.

3. **Sequential Logic**: Use a sequential always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to update the previous state and compute the edge detection.

4. **Edge Detection Implementation**: For each bit, compare the current state with the previous state. If they differ, set the corresponding bit in `anyedge` to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.

5. **Initialization**: Initialize the previous state register to zero in simulation to ensure correct behavior from the start.

        anyedge <= in ^ prev_in;
        // Update previous state
        prev_in <= in;
