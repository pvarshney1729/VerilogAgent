        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high, synchronous reset)\n  - data: 1-bit input (input bit stream)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - start_shifting: 1-bit output (indicates the detection of the sequence 1101)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that searches for the specific bit sequence \"1101\" within the incoming data stream. \n\nBehavior:\n- Upon detecting the sequence \"1101\", the output signal start_shifting shall be set to high (1) and remain high indefinitely until the reset signal is activated.\n- The reset signal is synchronous and, when asserted (high), will reset the FSM to its initial state, setting start_shifting to low (0).\n\nState Initialization:\n- All sequential elements, including flip-flops and registers, must be initialized to a defined state upon reset. The initial state of the FSM should be defined clearly in the implementation.\n\nClocking:\n- The FSM transitions and output updates occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle cases where the input data stream is shorter than the sequence length (4 bits) gracefully, ensuring that start_shifting remains low (0) until sufficient data is available.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output start_shifting is directly dependent on the internal state of the FSM, which is influenced by the incoming data and the clk signal.\n\nPrecedence of Operations:\n- The FSM state transitions occur before the output signal is updated on each clock cycle.\n\nRace Conditions:\n- Care must be taken to avoid race conditions by ensuring that all state transitions and output assignments are synchronized with the clk signal.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The input data stream is treated as a series of bits, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] representing the most significant bit (MSB) of the sequence \"1101\".\n                    "
