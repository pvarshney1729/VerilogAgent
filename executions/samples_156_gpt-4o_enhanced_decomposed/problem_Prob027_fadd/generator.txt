<REASONING>
To implement a full adder in Verilog, we need to consider the logic for both the sum and carry-out outputs. A full adder takes three inputs: two significant bits (`a` and `b`) and a carry-in bit (`cin`). It produces a sum and a carry-out (`cout`).

The logic for the sum (`sum`) is given by the XOR operation of the three inputs:
- `sum = a ^ b ^ cin`

The logic for the carry-out (`cout`) is given by the following expression:
- `cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin)`

These expressions are derived from the truth table of a full adder. The XOR operation is used for the sum because it outputs true when an odd number of inputs are true, which matches the behavior of binary addition without carry. The carry-out is true if any two of the inputs are true, which is captured by the OR of the AND operations.

We will implement this logic using an `assign` statement for combinational logic, as it directly maps the logic expressions to hardware without the need for an `always` block. This approach adheres to the coding conventions provided, ensuring that the logic is correctly inferred and synthesized.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic cin,
    output logic cout,
    output logic sum
);
    // Combinational logic for full adder
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;          // XOR for sum
    assign cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin); // OR of ANDs for carry-out
endmodule
