Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - in: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - Represents an 8-bit signed integer.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - out: bit[31:0] (32 bits) - Represents a 32-bit signed integer resulting from the sign extension of the input.\n\nFunctionality:\nThe module shall perform sign extension on the 8-bit input 'in' to produce a 32-bit output 'out'. The sign extension process involves the following steps:\n1. Identify the sign bit of the input, which is bit[7] (the most significant bit).\n2. Replicate the sign bit (bit[7]) 24 times to the left of the 8-bit input to form a 32-bit output.\n3. The resulting output 'out' shall be constructed as follows:\n   - out = { {24{in[7]}}, in } \n   Where {24{in[7]}} denotes the concatenation of 24 copies of the sign bit in[7].\n\nBehavior:\n- The output 'out' shall reflect the sign-extended value of 'in' immediately upon any change in the input.\n- The module does not include any clocked or sequential elements; it operates purely as combinational logic.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module shall handle all possible values of the 8-bit input 'in', including the maximum (8'b11111111) and minimum (8'b10000000) values, ensuring correct sign extension for both positive and negative integers.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are specified for this module as it operates purely combinationally.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
