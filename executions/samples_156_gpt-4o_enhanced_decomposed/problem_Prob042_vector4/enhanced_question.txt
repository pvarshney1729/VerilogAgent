Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - Represents an 8-bit signed integer.
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: bit[31:0] (32 bits) - Represents a 32-bit signed integer resulting from the sign extension of the input.

Functionality:
The module shall perform sign extension on the 8-bit input 'in' to produce a 32-bit output 'out'. The sign extension process involves the following steps:
1. Identify the sign bit of the input, which is bit[7] (the most significant bit).
2. Replicate the sign bit (bit[7]) 24 times to the left of the 8-bit input to form a 32-bit output.
3. The resulting output 'out' shall be constructed as follows:
   - out = { {24{in[7]}}, in } 
   Where {24{in[7]}} denotes the concatenation of 24 copies of the sign bit in[7].

Behavior:
- The output 'out' shall reflect the sign-extended value of 'in' immediately upon any change in the input.
- The module does not include any clocked or sequential elements; it operates purely as combinational logic.

Edge Cases:
- The module shall handle all possible values of the 8-bit input 'in', including the maximum (8'b11111111) and minimum (8'b10000000) values, ensuring correct sign extension for both positive and negative integers.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module as it operates purely combinationally.
