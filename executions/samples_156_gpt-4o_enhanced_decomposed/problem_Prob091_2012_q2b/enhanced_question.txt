Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - y: 6-bit one-hot encoded state input (y[5:0])
    - y[0] corresponds to state A
    - y[1] corresponds to state B
    - y[2] corresponds to state C
    - y[3] corresponds to state D
    - y[4] corresponds to state E
    - y[5] corresponds to state F
- Input Port:
  - w: 1-bit control input
- Output Ports:
  - Y1: 1-bit output signal, derived from state flip-flop y[1]
  - Y3: 1-bit output signal, derived from state flip-flop y[3]

Finite-State Machine (FSM) Description:
States and Transitions:
- State A (y[0] = 1):
  - Transition to State B (y[1] = 1) on input w = 1
  - Remain in State A on input w = 0
- State B (y[1] = 1):
  - Transition to State C (y[2] = 1) on input w = 1
  - Transition to State D (y[3] = 1) on input w = 0
- State C (y[2] = 1):
  - Transition to State E (y[4] = 1) on input w = 1
  - Transition to State D (y[3] = 1) on input w = 0
- State D (y[3] = 1):
  - Transition to State F (y[5] = 1) on input w = 1
  - Transition to State A (y[0] = 1) on input w = 0
- State E (y[4] = 1):
  - Remain in State E on input w = 1
  - Transition to State D (y[3] = 1) on input w = 0
- State F (y[5] = 1):
  - Transition to State C (y[2] = 1) on input w = 1
  - Transition to State D (y[3] = 1) on input w = 0

Implementation Requirements:
- The output signal Y1 should be connected to the input of the state flip-flop corresponding to state B (y[1]).
- The output signal Y3 should be connected to the input of the state flip-flop corresponding to state D (y[3]).
- Ensure that all flip-flops have defined initial values and specify whether resets are synchronous or asynchronous.
- Clearly define the behavior of the FSM at edge cases and input boundaries.
- Ensure that the implementation adheres to the one-hot encoding scheme as specified.
