        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire c;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire d;  // 1-bit input\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire [3:0] mux_in;  // 4-bit output\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the provided Karnaugh map. The outputs of the module, mux_in[3:0], are determined by the values of the inputs c and d, which serve as the control signals for a 4-to-1 multiplexer. The selection inputs for the multiplexer are defined as follows:\n- a = c\n- b = d\n\nKarnaugh Map:\nThe following Karnaugh map defines the output values for the mux_in signals based on the combinations of inputs a and b:\n\n      ab\n  cd  00  01  11  10\n  00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n  11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n  10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n\nOutput Connections:\n- mux_in[0] corresponds to ab = 00\n- mux_in[1] corresponds to ab = 01\n- mux_in[2] corresponds to ab = 11\n- mux_in[3] corresponds to ab = 10\n\nImplementation Constraints:\n- The design must utilize one 4-to-1 multiplexer and the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers necessary to achieve the desired output without using any additional logic gates.\n- The implementation must ensure that the outputs are correctly assigned based on the specified Karnaugh map.\n\nNotes:\n- Ensure that all signal assignments are made in a combinational logic context.\n- The module does not include any sequential logic elements or reset conditions, as it is purely combinational.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
