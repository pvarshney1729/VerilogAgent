Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire c;  // 1-bit input
  - input wire d;  // 1-bit input

- Output Ports:
  - output wire [3:0] mux_in;  // 4-bit output

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the provided Karnaugh map. The outputs of the module, mux_in[3:0], are determined by the values of the inputs c and d, which serve as the control signals for a 4-to-1 multiplexer. The selection inputs for the multiplexer are defined as follows:
- a = c
- b = d

Karnaugh Map:
The following Karnaugh map defines the output values for the mux_in signals based on the combinations of inputs a and b:

      ab
  cd  00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Output Connections:
- mux_in[0] corresponds to ab = 00
- mux_in[1] corresponds to ab = 01
- mux_in[2] corresponds to ab = 11
- mux_in[3] corresponds to ab = 10

Implementation Constraints:
- The design must utilize one 4-to-1 multiplexer and the minimum number of 2-to-1 multiplexers necessary to achieve the desired output without using any additional logic gates.
- The implementation must ensure that the outputs are correctly assigned based on the specified Karnaugh map.

Notes:
- Ensure that all signal assignments are made in a combinational logic context.
- The module does not include any sequential logic elements or reset conditions, as it is purely combinational.
