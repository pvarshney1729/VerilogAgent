Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - resetn: 1-bit input (active-low synchronous reset)
  - r: 3-bit input (request signals from three devices, where r[0] is the most significant bit and r[2] is the least significant bit)

- Output Ports:
  - g: 3-bit output (grant signals to the three devices, where g[0] corresponds to device 0, g[1] to device 1, and g[2] to device 2)

State Diagram Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states and transitions:

States:
- A: Initial state, no device has access to the resource.
- B: Device 0 has access to the resource (g[0] = 1).
- C: Device 1 has access to the resource (g[1] = 1).
- D: Device 2 has access to the resource (g[2] = 1).

State Transitions:
- From state A:
  - If r[0] = 1, transition to state B.
  - If r[0] = 0 and r[1] = 1, transition to state C.
  - If r[0] = 0, r[1] = 0, and r[2] = 1, transition to state D.
  - Remain in state A if r[0] = 0, r[1] = 0, and r[2] = 0.

- From state B:
  - If r[0] = 1, remain in state B.
  - If r[0] = 0, transition back to state A.

- From state C:
  - If r[1] = 1, remain in state C.
  - If r[1] = 0, transition back to state A.

- From state D:
  - If r[2] = 1, remain in state D.
  - If r[2] = 0, transition back to state A.

Reset Behavior:
- The resetn signal is an active-low synchronous reset. When resetn is low, the FSM transitions to state A.

Grant Signal Behavior:
- The output signals g[i] (for i = 0, 1, 2) indicate which device has been granted access to the resource. The grant signal for a device is set to 1 when that device is in the corresponding state (B for g[0], C for g[1], D for g[2]).

Implementation Guidelines:
- Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and the state flip-flops.
- Define state codes for A, B, C, and D as needed.
- Ensure all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- Initialize all state registers to the reset state (state A) upon reset.
- Clearly define the behavior of the FSM at edge cases, such as simultaneous requests from multiple devices.
