Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - resetn: 1-bit input (active-low synchronous reset)\n  - r: 3-bit input (request signals from three devices, where r[0] is the most significant bit and r[2] is the least significant bit)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - g: 3-bit output (grant signals to the three devices, where g[0] corresponds to device 0, g[1] to device 1, and g[2] to device 2)\n\nState Diagram Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states and transitions:\n\nStates:\n- A: Initial state, no device has access to the resource.\n- B: Device 0 has access to the resource (g[0] = 1).\n- C: Device 1 has access to the resource (g[1] = 1).\n- D: Device 2 has access to the resource (g[2] = 1).\n\nState Transitions:\n- From state A:\n  - If r[0] = 1, transition to state B.\n  - If r[0] = 0 and r[1] = 1, transition to state C.\n  - If r[0] = 0, r[1] = 0, and r[2] = 1, transition to state D.\n  - Remain in state A if r[0] = 0, r[1] = 0, and r[2] = 0.\n\n- From state B:\n  - If r[0] = 1, remain in state B.\n  - If r[0] = 0, transition back to state A.\n\n- From state C:\n  - If r[1] = 1, remain in state C.\n  - If r[1] = 0, transition back to state A.\n\n- From state D:\n  - If r[2] = 1, remain in state D.\n  - If r[2] = 0, transition back to state A.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The resetn signal is an active-low synchronous reset. When resetn is low, the FSM transitions to state A.\n\nGrant Signal Behavior:\n- The output signals g[i] (for i = 0, 1, 2) indicate which device has been granted access to the resource. The grant signal for a device is set to 1 when that device is in the corresponding state (B for g[0], C for g[1], D for g[2]).\n\nImplementation Guidelines:\n- Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and the state flip-flops.\n- Define state codes for A, B, C, and D as needed.\n- Ensure all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- Initialize all state registers to the reset state (state A) upon reset.\n- Clearly define the behavior of the FSM at edge cases, such as simultaneous requests from multiple devices.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
