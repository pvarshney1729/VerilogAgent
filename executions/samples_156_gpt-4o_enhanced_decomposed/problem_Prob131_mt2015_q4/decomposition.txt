Module A implements the boolean function z = (x^y) & x.

Module B can be described by the following simulation waveform:

  time  x  y  z
  0ns   0  0  1
  5ns   0  0  1
  10ns  0  0  1
  15ns  0  0  1
  20ns  0  0  1
  25ns  1  0  0
  30ns  1  0  0
  35ns  0  1  0
  40ns  0  1  0
  45ns  1  1  1
  50ns  1  1  1
  55ns  0  0  1
  60ns  0  1  0

  80ns  0  1  0

  90ns  1  0  0

Now consider a top-level module with the following interface:

 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output z

The module is implemented with two A submodules and two B submodules. The
first input of all four submodules is connect to input 'x', and the
second input of all four submodules is connected to 'y'. The output of
the first A submodule is connected to a two-input OR, along with the
output of the first B submodule. The second pair of A and B submodules is
similarly connected to an AND gate. The output of the OR and the AND is
connected to an XOR, whose output is 'z'.
