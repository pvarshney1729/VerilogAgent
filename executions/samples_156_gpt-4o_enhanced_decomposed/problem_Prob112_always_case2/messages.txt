        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - in: bit[3:0] (4 bits) - Represents a 4-bit input vector where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - pos: bit[1:0] (2 bits) - Represents the position of the first '1' bit in the input vector. The output is encoded such that pos[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and pos[1] is the next significant bit.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a 4-bit priority encoder, which is a combinational logic circuit. The module outputs the position of the first '1' bit in the input vector 'in'. The output 'pos' is defined as follows:\n- If 'in' is non-zero, 'pos' will indicate the index of the highest priority '1' bit (with the highest priority assigned to bit[3] and the lowest to bit[0]).\n- If 'in' is zero (i.e., all bits are '0'), the output 'pos' will be set to 2'b00.\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The output 'pos' will be updated immediately based on the current value of 'in' without any clocking mechanism, as this is a purely combinational circuit.\n- The output 'pos' will have the following mapping based on the input 'in':\n  - If in[3] = 1, pos = 2'b11\n  - If in[2] = 1, pos = 2'b10\n  - If in[1] = 1, pos = 2'b01\n  - If in[0] = 1, pos = 2'b00\n  - If in = 4'b0000, pos = 2'b00\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all 16 possible combinations of the 4-bit input vector 'in'.\n- Ensure that the output 'pos' is correctly set to 2'b00 when 'in' is zero, regardless of any previous state.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that the logic for determining the output 'pos' is free from race conditions and is implemented in a straightforward manner to maintain clarity and correctness.\n                    "
