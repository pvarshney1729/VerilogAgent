Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The following specification describes an 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) module. The module selects one of two 8-bit input signals based on a single-bit select signal.\n\nModule Name: TopModule\n\nInputs:\n- sel: A 1-bit select signal (input) that determines which of the two 8-bit inputs is routed to the output. \n  - When sel = 0, the output will be driven by input 'a'.\n  - When sel = 1, the output will be driven by input 'b'.\n  \n- a: An 8-bit input signal (input) representing the first data source. \n  - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- b: An 8-bit input signal (input) representing the second data source. \n  - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nOutput:\n- out: A 1-bit output signal (output) that reflects the selected input based on the value of 'sel'.\n\nBehavior:\n- The output 'out' is defined as follows:\n  - out = a when sel = 0\n  - out = b when sel = 1\n\nImplementation Details:\n- The output 'out' should be driven combinationally based on the values of 'sel', 'a', and 'b'.\n- Ensure that the logic correctly implements the MUX functionality without any race conditions or glitches during transitions of the select signal.\n- The output should be stable and reflect the selected input immediately upon changes to 'sel'.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible values of 'a' and 'b', including all combinations of 0s and 1s.\n- The module should not have any undefined states; all outputs must be deterministically defined based on the inputs.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- There is no reset signal defined for this module; the output is purely combinational based on the inputs.\n\nNote: Ensure that the implementation is verified against the functional intent described above.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nConsider the following implementation of an 8-bit 2-to-1 mux:\n\n  module TopModule (\n      input        sel,\n      input  [7:0] a,\n      input  [7:0] b,\n      output       out\n  );\n\n      assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);\n\n  endmodule\n\nUnfortunately, this module has a bug. Implement a new version of this\nmodule that fixes the bug.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
