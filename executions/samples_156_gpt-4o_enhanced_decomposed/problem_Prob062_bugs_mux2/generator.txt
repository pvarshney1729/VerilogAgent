<REASONING>
The original implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer has a bug in the way it handles the output. The output `out` is declared as a single bit, but the operation performed is a bitwise operation on 8-bit vectors `a` and `b`. This results in a mismatch between the width of the operands and the width of the output.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the output `out` is also an 8-bit vector to match the inputs `a` and `b`. This will allow the bitwise operations to be performed correctly across all bits of the inputs.

Additionally, the use of bitwise AND and OR operations is correct for selecting between the two inputs based on the `sel` signal. The corrected implementation will ensure that the output is correctly assigned as an 8-bit vector.

module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    assign out = (~{8{sel}} & a) | ({8{sel}} & b);
