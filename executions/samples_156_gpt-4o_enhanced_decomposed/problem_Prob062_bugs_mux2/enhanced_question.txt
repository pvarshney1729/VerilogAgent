<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The following specification describes an 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) module. The module selects one of two 8-bit input signals based on a single-bit select signal.

Module Name: TopModule

Inputs:
- sel: A 1-bit select signal (input) that determines which of the two 8-bit inputs is routed to the output. 
  - When sel = 0, the output will be driven by input 'a'.
  - When sel = 1, the output will be driven by input 'b'.
  
- a: An 8-bit input signal (input) representing the first data source. 
  - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- b: An 8-bit input signal (input) representing the second data source. 
  - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

Output:
- out: A 1-bit output signal (output) that reflects the selected input based on the value of 'sel'.

Behavior:
- The output 'out' is defined as follows:
  - out = a when sel = 0
  - out = b when sel = 1

Implementation Details:
- The output 'out' should be driven combinationally based on the values of 'sel', 'a', and 'b'.
- Ensure that the logic correctly implements the MUX functionality without any race conditions or glitches during transitions of the select signal.
- The output should be stable and reflect the selected input immediately upon changes to 'sel'.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible values of 'a' and 'b', including all combinations of 0s and 1s.
- The module should not have any undefined states; all outputs must be deterministically defined based on the inputs.

Reset Behavior:
- There is no reset signal defined for this module; the output is purely combinational based on the inputs.

Note: Ensure that the implementation is verified against the functional intent described above.
