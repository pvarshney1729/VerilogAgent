<REASONING>
To implement a half adder in Verilog, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with the specified interface. A half adder takes two single-bit inputs and produces a sum and a carry-out. The sum is the result of the XOR operation on the inputs, and the carry-out is the result of the AND operation on the inputs. 

Given the guidelines and coding conventions, we will:
1. Declare all ports as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.
2. Use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) for combinational logic, as there is no need for an always block in this simple logic.
3. Ensure that the module strictly follows the provided interface and signal names.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic sum,
    output logic cout
);
    // Implementing the half adder logic
    assign sum = a ^ b;  // XOR operation for sum
    assign cout = a & b; // AND operation for carry-out
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic sum,
    output logic cout
);
    // Implementing the half adder logic
    assign sum = a ^ b;  // XOR operation for sum
    assign cout = a & b; // AND operation for carry-out
endmodule
