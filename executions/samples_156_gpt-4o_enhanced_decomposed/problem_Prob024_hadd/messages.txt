Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input representing the first operand\n  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input representing the second operand\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output logic sum;  // 1-bit output representing the sum of inputs a and b\n  - output logic cout;  // 1-bit output representing the carry-out from the addition\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a half adder, which is a combinational logic circuit that takes two single-bit binary inputs (a and b) and produces two outputs: \n1. sum: the result of the addition of inputs a and b.\n2. cout: the carry-out, which indicates whether there is a carry from the addition of a and b.\n\nBehavior:\n- The sum output is defined as: sum = a XOR b\n- The carry-out output is defined as: cout = a AND b\n\nSignal Characteristics:\n- All input and output ports are defined as 1-bit wide logic signals.\n- The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible combinations of input values (00, 01, 10, 11) and produce the corresponding outputs as specified.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are applicable as this is a purely combinational module with no state retention.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a\n - input  b\n - output sum\n - output cout\n\nThe module should implement a half adder. A half adder adds two bits\n(with no carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
