<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input representing the first operand
  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input representing the second operand

- Output Ports:
  - output logic sum;  // 1-bit output representing the sum of inputs a and b
  - output logic cout;  // 1-bit output representing the carry-out from the addition

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a half adder, which is a combinational logic circuit that takes two single-bit binary inputs (a and b) and produces two outputs: 
1. sum: the result of the addition of inputs a and b.
2. cout: the carry-out, which indicates whether there is a carry from the addition of a and b.

Behavior:
- The sum output is defined as: sum = a XOR b
- The carry-out output is defined as: cout = a AND b

Signal Characteristics:
- All input and output ports are defined as 1-bit wide logic signals.
- The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible combinations of input values (00, 01, 10, 11) and produce the corresponding outputs as specified.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are applicable as this is a purely combinational module with no state retention.
