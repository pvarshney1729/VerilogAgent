Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)

- Output Ports:
  - q: 4-bit output (binary counter value, where q[0] is the least significant bit and q[3] is the most significant bit)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15 (inclusive) with a wrap-around period of 16. The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The counter is incremented on the rising edge of clk.
- The reset input (reset) is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (high), the counter (q) is set to 4'b0000 (0).
- The counter should maintain its value between clock cycles unless reset is activated.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon power-up or when reset is asserted, the output q should initialize to 4'b0000.

Edge Cases:
- The counter should correctly wrap around from 15 (4'b1111) back to 0 (4'b0000) on the next increment after reaching its maximum value.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals, with the counter logic being executed only on the positive edge of clk.
