<REASONING>
To implement the 4-bit binary counter with the specified interface, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Interface Definition**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The inputs are `clk` and `reset`, both 1-bit, and the output `q` is 4-bits wide.

2. **Counter Logic**: The counter should increment on every positive edge of the clock. It should count from 0 to 15, which requires a 4-bit register to hold the current count value.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is active high and synchronous, meaning it should reset the counter to 0 on the next clock edge when `reset` is high.

4. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock to implement the counter. Inside this block, check the `reset` signal first. If `reset` is high, set the counter to 0. Otherwise, increment the counter.

5. **Output Assignment**: The current value of the counter should be assigned to the output `q`.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for all signals, and ensure numeric constants are properly sized.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the counter value
    logic [3:0] count;

    // Sequential logic for the counter
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 4'b0000; // Reset the counter to 0
        end else begin
            count <= count + 4'b0001; // Increment the counter
        end
    end

    // Assign the counter value to the output
    assign q = count;

endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
