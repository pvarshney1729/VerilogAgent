Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 4-bit output (binary counter value, where q[0] is the least significant bit and q[3] is the most significant bit)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15 (inclusive) with a wrap-around period of 16. The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The counter is incremented on the rising edge of clk.\n- The reset input (reset) is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (high), the counter (q) is set to 4'b0000 (0).\n- The counter should maintain its value between clock cycles unless reset is activated.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon power-up or when reset is asserted, the output q should initialize to 4'b0000.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The counter should correctly wrap around from 15 (4'b1111) back to 0 (4'b0000) on the next increment after reaching its maximum value.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals, with the counter logic being executed only on the positive edge of clk.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

Assume all sequential logic\nis triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The reset input is active\nhigh synchronous, and should reset the counter to 0.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
