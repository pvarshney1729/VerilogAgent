<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to perform the addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, `a` and `b`, and produce an 8-bit result `s`. Additionally, we need to determine if a signed overflow occurs during this addition. 

1. **Addition**: The addition of two 8-bit numbers can be done using the `+` operator in Verilog. The result will be stored in an 8-bit output `s`.

2. **Overflow Detection**: In 2's complement arithmetic, overflow occurs when:
   - Adding two positive numbers results in a negative number.
   - Adding two negative numbers results in a positive number.
   
   This can be detected by examining the carry into and out of the most significant bit (MSB). Specifically, overflow occurs if the carry into the MSB is different from the carry out of the MSB.

3. **Implementation**: 
   - Use an `always @(*)` block for combinational logic to calculate the sum and detect overflow.
   - Declare all ports and internal signals as `logic` as per the coding conventions.
   - Use a temporary variable to hold the full 9-bit result of the addition to check for overflow.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [7:0] a,
    input logic [7:0] b,
    output logic [7:0] s,
    output logic overflow
);
    logic [8:0] sum; // 9-bit to capture carry out

    always @(*) begin
        sum = a + b; // Perform addition
        s = sum[7:0]; // Assign lower 8 bits to output
        // Overflow detection: check if carry into MSB is different from carry out
        overflow = (a[7] == b[7]) && (s[7] != a[7]);
    end
endmodule
[DONE]
