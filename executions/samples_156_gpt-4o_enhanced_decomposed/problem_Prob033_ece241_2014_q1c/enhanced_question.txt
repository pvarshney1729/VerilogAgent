<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit[7:0] (8 bits, signed 2's complement)
  - b: bit[7:0] (8 bits, signed 2's complement)
  
- Output Ports:
  - s: bit[7:0] (8 bits, signed 2's complement, result of addition)
  - overflow: bit (1 bit, indicates if signed overflow occurred)

Functionality:
The TopModule shall perform the addition of two signed 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a and b. The result of the addition shall be stored in the output port s. The module shall also compute the overflow condition, which occurs when the addition of a and b results in a value that exceeds the representable range of an 8-bit signed integer.

Overflow Condition:
- Overflow occurs if:
  - Both a and b are positive (a[7] = 0 and b[7] = 0) and the result s is negative (s[7] = 1).
  - Both a and b are negative (a[7] = 1 and b[7] = 1) and the result s is positive (s[7] = 0).

Implementation Notes:
- The module shall be implemented as combinational logic, with no internal state or clock cycles involved.
- There are no resets or initial values required for this module as it is purely combinational.
- Ensure that the addition operation is performed with proper handling of signed numbers according to 2's complement arithmetic.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle the maximum and minimum values of a and b, specifically:
  - a = 127 (01111111) and b = 1 (00000001) should result in overflow.
  - a = -128 (10000000) and b = -1 (11111111) should also result in overflow.
