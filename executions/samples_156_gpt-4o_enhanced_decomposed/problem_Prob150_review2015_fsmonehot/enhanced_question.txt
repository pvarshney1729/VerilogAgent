State Machine Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with three inputs (d, done_counting, ack) and three outputs (shift_ena, counting, done). The outputs are assumed to be 0 unless otherwise specified in the state transition table below.

State Transition Table:
- States are represented using one-hot encoding:
  - S     = 10'b0000000001
  - S1    = 10'b0000000010
  - S11   = 10'b0000000100
  - S110  = 10'b0000001000
  - B0    = 10'b0000010000
  - B1    = 10'b0000100000
  - B2    = 10'b0001000000
  - B3    = 10'b0010000000
  - Count  = 10'b0100000000
  - Wait   = 10'b1000000000

State Transition Logic:
- Current State: S
  - d = 0 -> Next State: S
  - d = 1 -> Next State: S1
- Current State: S1
  - d = 0 -> Next State: S
  - d = 1 -> Next State: S11
- Current State: S11
  - d = 0 -> Next State: S110
  - d = 1 -> Next State: S11
- Current State: S110
  - d = 0 -> Next State: S
  - d = 1 -> Next State: B0
- Current State: B0
  - (always go to next cycle) -> Next State: B1
- Current State: B1
  - (always go to next cycle) -> Next State: B2
- Current State: B2
  - (always go to next cycle) -> Next State: B3
- Current State: B3
  - (always go to next cycle) -> Next State: Count
- Current State: Count
  - counting = 1, done_counting = 0 -> Next State: Count
  - counting = 1, done_counting = 1 -> Next State: Wait
- Current State: Wait
  - done = 1, ack = 0 -> Next State: Wait
  - done = 1, ack = 1 -> Next State: S

Reset Condition:
- At reset, the state machine initializes to state "S".

Output Logic:
- The output signals (B3_next, S_next, S1_next, Count_next, Wait_next, done, counting, shift_ena) are derived from the current state and the next state logic.

Note: Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have explicitly defined initial values and that the reset is synchronous. The behavior at edge cases and input boundaries should be handled appropriately.
