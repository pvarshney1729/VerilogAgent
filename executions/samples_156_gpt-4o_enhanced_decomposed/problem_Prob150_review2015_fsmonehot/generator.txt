<REASONING>
To implement the state machine using one-hot encoding, we need to define the next-state logic and output logic based on the given state transitions and outputs. The one-hot encoding assigns a unique bit position to each state, which simplifies the state transition logic.

1. **State Encoding**: 
   - S = 10'b0000000001
   - S1 = 10'b0000000010
   - S11 = 10'b0000000100
   - S110 = 10'b0000001000
   - B0 = 10'b0000010000
   - B1 = 10'b0000100000
   - B2 = 10'b0001000000
   - B3 = 10'b0010000000
   - Count = 10'b0100000000
   - Wait = 10'b1000000000

2. **Next-State Logic**:
   - `S_next` is asserted when the next state is S, which occurs from S on `d=0`, from S1 on `d=0`, from S110 on `d=0`, and from Wait on `ack=1`.
   - `S1_next` is asserted when the next state is S1, which occurs from S on `d=1`.
   - `B3_next` is asserted when the next state is B3, which occurs from B2.
   - `Count_next` is asserted when the next state is Count, which occurs from B3.
   - `Wait_next` is asserted when the next state is Wait, which occurs from Count on `done_counting=1`.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - `shift_ena` is asserted in states B0, B1, B2, and B3.
   - `counting` is asserted in state Count.
   - `done` is asserted in state Wait.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Use combinational logic to determine the next state and outputs based on the current state and inputs.
   - Use an always block with `always @(*)` to describe the combinational logic.
