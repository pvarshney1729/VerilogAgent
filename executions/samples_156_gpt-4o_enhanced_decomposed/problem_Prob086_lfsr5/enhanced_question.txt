Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: 5-bit output (LFSR state, where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[4] is the most significant bit (MSB))

Description:
The module implements a 5-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) designed to generate a maximum-length sequence. The LFSR shifts right, with the following characteristics:

- Feedback Mechanism:
  - The next state of the LFSR is determined by XORing the output of the LSB (q[0]) with the bits at the tap positions, specifically:
    - Tap positions: 5 (q[4]) and 3 (q[2])
  - The feedback equation can be expressed as:
    next_state = q[4] XOR q[2] XOR q[0]

- State Transition:
  - On each positive edge of the clk signal, if reset is low (inactive), the LFSR shifts right, and the new value is computed based on the feedback mechanism.
  - If reset is high (active), the output q is set to the value 5'b00001 (binary representation of 1).

- Reset Behavior:
  - The reset is synchronous, meaning the reset condition is evaluated on the rising edge of the clk signal.
  - The initial state of the LFSR upon reset is 5'b00001.

- Maximum-Length Sequence:
  - The LFSR will cycle through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, and the all-zero state (5'b00000) will never be reached.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the reset condition is prioritized over the clock signal to maintain correct operation during initialization.
- The module should handle the transition from reset to normal operation seamlessly.

All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
