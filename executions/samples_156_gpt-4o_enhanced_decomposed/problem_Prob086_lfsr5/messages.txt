        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset signal)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 5-bit output (LFSR state, where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[4] is the most significant bit (MSB))\n\nDescription:\nThe module implements a 5-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) designed to generate a maximum-length sequence. The LFSR shifts right, with the following characteristics:\n\n- Feedback Mechanism:\n  - The next state of the LFSR is determined by XORing the output of the LSB (q[0]) with the bits at the tap positions, specifically:\n    - Tap positions: 5 (q[4]) and 3 (q[2])\n  - The feedback equation can be expressed as:\n    next_state = q[4] XOR q[2] XOR q[0]\n\n- State Transition:\n  - On each positive edge of the clk signal, if reset is low (inactive), the LFSR shifts right, and the new value is computed based on the feedback mechanism.\n  - If reset is high (active), the output q is set to the value 5'b00001 (binary representation of 1).\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - The reset is synchronous, meaning the reset condition is evaluated on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n  - The initial state of the LFSR upon reset is 5'b00001.\n\n- Maximum-Length Sequence:\n  - The LFSR will cycle through 2^5 - 1 = 31 unique states before repeating, and the all-zero state (5'b00000) will never be reached.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the reset condition is prioritized over the clock signal to maintain correct operation during initialization.\n- The module should handle the transition from reset to normal operation seamlessly.\n\nAll sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
