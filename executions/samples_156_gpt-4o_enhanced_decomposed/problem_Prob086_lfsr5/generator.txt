<REASONING>
To implement a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Interface Definition**: Define the module with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, and the output port is `q`, which is 5 bits wide.

2. **LFSR Logic**: The Galois LFSR shifts right, and the new value of each bit is determined by XORing the LSB (q[0]) with the tapped positions. For a 5-bit LFSR with taps at positions 5 and 3, the feedback path will XOR q[0] with q[4] and q[2].

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that sets the LFSR to a non-zero state (e.g., 5'b00001) when the reset signal is high.

4. **Sequential Logic**: Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to update the LFSR state. The reset logic should be checked first, followed by the LFSR update logic.

5. **Bitwise Operations**: Use bitwise XOR operations to implement the feedback logic.

6. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the specified coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the LFSR operates correctly and cycles through all possible states except the all-zero state.

        end else begin
            // Galois LFSR with taps at positions 5 and 3
            lfsr <= {lfsr[3:0], lfsr[4] ^ lfsr[2]};
