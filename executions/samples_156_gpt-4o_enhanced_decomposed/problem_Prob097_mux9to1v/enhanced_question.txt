Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - b: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - c: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - d: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - e: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - f: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - g: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - h: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - i: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)
  - sel: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)
  
- Output Port:
  - out: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)

Functionality:
The module implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. The selection input 'sel' determines which of the input signals (a through i) is routed to the output 'out' as follows:
- When sel = 0, out = a
- When sel = 1, out = b
- When sel = 2, out = c
- When sel = 3, out = d
- When sel = 4, out = e
- When sel = 5, out = f
- When sel = 6, out = g
- When sel = 7, out = h
- When sel = 8, out = i
- For sel = 9 to 15, out is set to '1111 1111 1111 1111' (all bits are '1').

Implementation Notes:
- The output 'out' should be updated combinationally based on the value of 'sel'.
- Ensure that the output is stable and reflects the selected input immediately upon a change in 'sel'.
- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets defined for this module.
- The module does not include any sequential logic elements; all operations are purely combinational.
