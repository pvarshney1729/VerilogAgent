Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - a: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - b: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - c: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - d: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - e: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - f: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - g: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - h: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - i: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n  - sel: bit[3:0] (4 bits, unsigned)\n  \n- Output Port:\n  - out: bit[15:0] (16 bits, unsigned)\n\nFunctionality:\nThe module implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. The selection input 'sel' determines which of the input signals (a through i) is routed to the output 'out' as follows:\n- When sel = 0, out = a\n- When sel = 1, out = b\n- When sel = 2, out = c\n- When sel = 3, out = d\n- When sel = 4, out = e\n- When sel = 5, out = f\n- When sel = 6, out = g\n- When sel = 7, out = h\n- When sel = 8, out = i\n- For sel = 9 to 15, out is set to '1111 1111 1111 1111' (all bits are '1').\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The output 'out' should be updated combinationally based on the value of 'sel'.\n- Ensure that the output is stable and reflects the selected input immediately upon a change in 'sel'.\n- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets defined for this module.\n- The module does not include any sequential logic elements; all operations are purely combinational.\n                    "
