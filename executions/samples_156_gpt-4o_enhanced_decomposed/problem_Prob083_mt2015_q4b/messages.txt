If a reset is required, it should be defined in the implementation.\n\nClocking:\n- The module does not specify any clocking behavior. If sequential logic is to be implemented, clock and reset signals should be defined.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all combinations of inputs 'x' and 'y' as described above without any undefined states.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The output 'z' should be initialized to a known state (1) when both inputs are 0 at the start of the simulation.\n\nEnd of Specification.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
