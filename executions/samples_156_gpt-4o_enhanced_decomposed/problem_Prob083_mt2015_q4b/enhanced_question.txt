Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic x;  // 1-bit input
  - input logic y;  // 1-bit input
- Output Ports:
  - output logic z; // 1-bit output

Signal Definitions:
- The input signals 'x' and 'y' are treated as unsigned 1-bit values.
- The output signal 'z' is also treated as an unsigned 1-bit value.

Behavioral Description:
- The output 'z' is determined by the following conditions based on the values of 'x' and 'y':
  - When both 'x' and 'y' are 0, 'z' is 1.
  - When 'x' is 1 and 'y' is 0, 'z' is 0.
  - When 'x' is 0 and 'y' is 1, 'z' is 0.
  - When both 'x' and 'y' are 1, 'z' is 1.

Simulation Waveform:
- The following table describes the expected output 'z' over time based on the input values of 'x' and 'y':

  | Time (ns) | x | y | z |
  |-----------|---|---|---|
  | 0         | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 5         | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 10        | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 15        | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 20        | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 25        | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 30        | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 35        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 40        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 45        | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 50        | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 55        | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 60        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 65        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 70        | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 75        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 80        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 85        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 90        | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Reset Conditions:
- The module does not specify any reset conditions. If a reset is required, it should be defined in the implementation.

Clocking:
- The module does not specify any clocking behavior. If sequential logic is to be implemented, clock and reset signals should be defined.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all combinations of inputs 'x' and 'y' as described above without any undefined states.

Initial Conditions:
- The output 'z' should be initialized to a known state (1) when both inputs are 0 at the start of the simulation.
