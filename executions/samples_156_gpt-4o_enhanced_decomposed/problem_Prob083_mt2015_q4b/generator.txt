<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` based on the given waveform, we need to determine the logic for output `z` based on inputs `x` and `y`. By analyzing the waveform, we can derive the following conditions:

1. When both `x` and `y` are `0`, `z` is `1`.
2. When `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`, `z` is `0`.
3. When `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, `z` is `0`.
4. When both `x` and `y` are `1`, `z` is `1`.

From these conditions, we can derive the logic expression for `z`:
- `z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y)`

This expression can be implemented using combinational logic in Verilog. We will use an `always @(*)` block to describe this combinational logic, ensuring that the output `z` is updated whenever there is a change in inputs `x` or `y`.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic x,
    input logic y,
    output logic z
);
    always @(*) begin
        z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y);
    end
endmodule
