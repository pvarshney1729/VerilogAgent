Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a;  // 1-bit input
  - input wire b;  // 1-bit input
  - input wire c;  // 1-bit input
  - input wire d;  // 1-bit input
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out;  // 1-bit output

Port Widths:
- All input and output ports are defined as 1-bit wide.

Karnaugh Map Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following Karnaugh map, which represents the output 'out' as a function of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The variables are indexed as follows:
- 'a' and 'b' represent the rows (with 'a' as the most significant bit).
- 'c' and 'd' represent the columns (with 'c' as the most significant bit).

Karnaugh Map:
              ab
   cd   00  01  11  10
   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Output Logic:
The output 'out' is defined by the following minterms based on the Karnaugh map:
- out = (a'b'c'd') + (a'b'c) + (a'bc'd) + (a'bc) + (ab'c) + (abc'd) + (abc)

Behavior at Edge Cases:
- The output 'out' should be evaluated for all combinations of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' (i.e., 0 or 1) to ensure correct functionality across the entire input space.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' without any sequential elements or clock cycles involved.

Ensure that the implementation adheres to the specified logic and accurately reflects the behavior described in the Karnaugh map.
