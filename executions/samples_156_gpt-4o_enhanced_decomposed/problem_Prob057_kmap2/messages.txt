Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire b;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire c;  // 1-bit input\n  - input wire d;  // 1-bit input\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out;  // 1-bit output\n\nPort Widths:\n- All input and output ports are defined as 1-bit wide.\n\nKarnaugh Map Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following Karnaugh map, which represents the output 'out' as a function of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The variables are indexed as follows:\n- 'a' and 'b' represent the rows (with 'a' as the most significant bit).\n- 'c' and 'd' represent the columns (with 'c' as the most significant bit).\n\nKarnaugh Map:\n              ab\n   cd   00  01  11  10\n   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n\nOutput Logic:\nThe output 'out' is defined by the following minterms based on the Karnaugh map:\n- out = (a'b'c'd') + (a'b'c) + (a'bc'd) + (a'bc) + (ab'c) + (abc'd) + (abc)\n\nBehavior at Edge Cases:\n- The output 'out' should be evaluated for all combinations of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' (i.e., 0 or 1) to ensure correct functionality across the entire input space.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' without any sequential elements or clock cycles involved.\n\nEnsure that the implementation adheres to the specified logic and accurately reflects the behavior described in the Karnaugh map.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
