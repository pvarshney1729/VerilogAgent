<REASONING>
To implement the "Game of Life" on a 16x16 toroidal grid, we need to consider the rules for updating each cell based on its neighbors. The grid wraps around, meaning the edges are connected to form a toroid. The module will have a 256-bit input `data` to load the initial state and a 256-bit output `q` to represent the current state of the grid. The `load` signal will be used to load the initial state into `q` on the next clock edge. The `clk` signal will be used to update the grid state every clock cycle.

1. **Input/Output Declaration**: We declare the inputs and outputs as specified. The grid is represented as a 256-bit vector, with each 16-bit segment representing a row.

2. **Grid Representation**: We need to convert the 256-bit vector into a 16x16 array for easier manipulation. This will allow us to access each cell and its neighbors conveniently.

3. **Neighbor Calculation**: For each cell, we calculate the number of alive neighbors. This involves checking the 8 surrounding cells, considering the toroidal wrapping.

4. **State Update Logic**: Based on the number of neighbors, we update the state of each cell according to the rules provided.

5. **Sequential Logic**: The state of the grid is updated on the positive edge of the clock. If `load` is high, the grid is initialized with the `data` input.

6. **Output Assignment**: The updated grid state is assigned to the output `q`.
