Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  load
 - input  data (256 bits)
 - output q (256 bits)

The module should implemement a "game" played on a two-dimensional grid
of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time
step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:

  (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.
  (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.
  (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.
  (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.

The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use
a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16
toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For
example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15),
(0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by
a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a
sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc.

  (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial
       state. Active high synchronous.
  (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.

The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
