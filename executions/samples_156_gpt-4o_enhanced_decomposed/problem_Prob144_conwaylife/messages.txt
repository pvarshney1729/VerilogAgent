        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - load: 1-bit input (active high synchronous load signal)\n  - data: 256-bit input (initial state of the grid)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 256-bit output (current state of the grid)\n\nGrid Representation:\n- The module implements a \"game\" played on a two-dimensional toroidal grid of cells, where each cell can be either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead).\n- The grid is represented as a 256-bit vector, where:\n  - q[15:0] corresponds to row 0,\n  - q[31:16] corresponds to row 1,\n  - ...\n  - q[255:240] corresponds to row 15.\n- Each cell's state is determined by the number of alive neighbors it has, according to the following rules:\n  1. If a cell has 0 or 1 alive neighbors, it becomes 0 (dead).\n  2. If a cell has exactly 2 alive neighbors, its state remains unchanged.\n  3. If a cell has exactly 3 alive neighbors, it becomes 1 (alive).\n  4. If a cell has 4 or more alive neighbors, it becomes 0 (dead).\n\nNeighbor Calculation:\n- The grid is treated as infinite, but for this implementation, a 16x16 toroidal grid is used. \n- Each cell at position (i, j) has neighbors that wrap around the edges of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has the following 8 neighbors:\n  - (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15).\n\nOperational Behavior:\n- The game state advances by one timestep on each positive edge of the clock.\n- The load signal allows for the initial state of the grid to be loaded into the output q at the next clock edge when load is high.\n- The output q reflects the current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.\n\nReset and Initialization:\n- The module does not specify an asynchronous or synchronous reset. If a reset is required, it should be defined in the implementation.\n- The initial state of the output q should be defined based on the load signal and the data input when load is asserted.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have explicitly defined initial values as per the loading mechanism.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The behavior of the module at the edges of the grid should be carefully handled to ensure correct neighbor calculations.\n- Ensure that the module can handle all possible input states for the data vector, including all cells being alive or dead.\n                    "
