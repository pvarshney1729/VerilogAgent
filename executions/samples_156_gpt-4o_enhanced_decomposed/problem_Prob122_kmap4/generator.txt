<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule` based on the given Karnaugh map, we need to derive the logic expression from the map. The Karnaugh map provided is a 4-variable map with variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The map is organized with `ab` as the columns and `cd` as the rows.

The map is as follows:

```
             ab
  cd   00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
```

From this map, we can derive the Sum of Products (SOP) expression by identifying the cells with a value of `1`:

- For `cd = 00` and `ab = 01`: `c'd'a'b`
- For `cd = 00` and `ab = 10`: `c'd'ab'`
- For `cd = 01` and `ab = 00`: `c'd'ab`
- For `cd = 01` and `ab = 11`: `c'dab`
- For `cd = 11` and `ab = 01`: `cd'a'b`
- For `cd = 11` and `ab = 10`: `cd'ab'`
- For `cd = 10` and `ab = 00`: `cd'ab`
- For `cd = 10` and `ab = 11`: `cdab`

The SOP expression is:
`out = c'd'a'b + c'd'ab' + c'd'ab + c'dab + cd'a'b + cd'ab' + cd'ab + cdab`

This expression can be simplified using Boolean algebra, but for the sake of this task, we will implement it directly as derived.
