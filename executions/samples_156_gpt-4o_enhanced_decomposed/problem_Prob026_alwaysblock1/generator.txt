<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` with the specified interface, we need to create a module that has two input ports (`a` and `b`) and two output ports (`out_assign` and `out_alwaysblock`). Both outputs should represent the logical AND of the inputs `a` and `b`.

1. **Using an `assign` statement**: This is a straightforward way to implement combinational logic in Verilog. The `assign` statement will directly assign the result of the AND operation between `a` and `b` to `out_assign`.

2. **Using an `always` block**: For the `out_alwaysblock`, we will use a combinational `always` block. The `always @(*)` construct is used to ensure that the block is sensitive to any changes in the inputs `a` or `b`. Inside the block, we will perform the AND operation and assign the result to `out_alwaysblock`.

Both methods will ensure that the outputs are updated whenever the inputs change, maintaining the correct behavior of an AND gate.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out_assign,
    output logic out_alwaysblock
);

    // Implement AND gate using assign statement
    assign out_assign = a & b;

    // Implement AND gate using always block
    always @(*) begin
        out_alwaysblock = a & b;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
