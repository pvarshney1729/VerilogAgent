Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit [0] (1-bit input, least significant bit)
  - b: bit [0] (1-bit input, least significant bit)

- Output Ports:
  - out_assign: bit [0] (1-bit output, least significant bit)
  - out_alwaysblock: bit [0] (1-bit output, least significant bit)

Functional Description:
The TopModule shall implement a logical AND operation between the input signals 'a' and 'b'. The result of this operation will be assigned to two output signals: 'out_assign' and 'out_alwaysblock'.

Implementation Details:
1. The output 'out_assign' will be driven by a continuous assignment statement (assign) that directly reflects the result of the AND operation.
2. The output 'out_alwaysblock' will be driven by a combinational always block that also implements the AND operation.

Signal Dependencies:
- The outputs 'out_assign' and 'out_alwaysblock' are both dependent on the inputs 'a' and 'b'.
- There are no sequential elements or clock cycles involved in this module.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible input combinations of 'a' and 'b' (0 or 1) and produce the corresponding outputs without any undefined behavior.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module as it is purely combinational logic.
