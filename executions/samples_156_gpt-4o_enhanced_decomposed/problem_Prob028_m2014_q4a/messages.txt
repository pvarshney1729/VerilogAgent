        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - d: 1-bit input (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)\n  - ena: 1-bit input (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 1-bit output (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a D latch. The output 'q' should follow the input 'd' when the enable signal 'ena' is high (logic high). When 'ena' is low (logic low), the output 'q' should retain its previous value.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- The D latch should be implemented using an always block that is sensitive to changes in 'ena' and 'd'.\n- The behavior of the latch should be defined as follows:\n  - If ena == 1, then q = d (the output follows the input).\n  - If ena == 0, then q retains its previous value (no change).\n\nReset Conditions:\n- The module does not specify a reset condition; therefore, the initial state of 'q' should be defined as '0' (logic low) at the start of simulation.\n\nTiming and Edge Cases:\n- The module should handle changes in 'd' and 'ena' asynchronously, meaning that changes in these inputs can occur at any time and should be reflected in the output as per the latch behavior described above.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'q' is dependent on both 'd' and 'ena'. Ensure that the implementation correctly reflects this dependency without introducing race conditions.\n\nEnd of Specification.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  d\n - input  ena\n - output q\n\nThe module should impement a D latch using an always block.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
