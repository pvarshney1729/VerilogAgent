Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input [7:0] a: 8-bit unsigned integer input representing the first value.
  - input [7:0] b: 8-bit unsigned integer input representing the second value.
  - input [7:0] c: 8-bit unsigned integer input representing the third value.
  - input [7:0] d: 8-bit unsigned integer input representing the fourth value.

- Output Ports:
  - output [7:0] min: 8-bit unsigned integer output representing the minimum value among the inputs.

Functional Description:
The TopModule shall compute the minimum value among the four 8-bit unsigned integer inputs (a, b, c, d) using standard comparison operators. The output 'min' will hold the smallest value of the inputs.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The comparison of the inputs will be performed using the less-than operator (<) to determine the minimum value.
- The module should handle all possible input combinations, including edge cases where multiple inputs may have the same minimum value.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the comparison logic correctly identifies the minimum value without introducing race conditions.
- The module should be designed as combinational logic, with no internal state or clock cycles involved.
