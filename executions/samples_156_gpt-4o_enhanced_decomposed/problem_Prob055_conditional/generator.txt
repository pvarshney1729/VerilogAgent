<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` that finds the minimum of four 8-bit input values (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`), we will use combinational logic. The task is to compare these inputs and determine the smallest value. Since the problem does not specify a clock or reset, we will focus on combinational logic only.

1. **Comparison Logic**: We will use nested conditional operators to compare the inputs. The conditional operator (`? :`) is suitable for this task as it allows us to perform comparisons and select the minimum value in a straightforward manner.

2. **Combinational Logic**: We will use an `always @(*)` block to ensure that the logic is combinational. This block will evaluate whenever any of the inputs change.

3. **Output Assignment**: The result of the comparisons will be assigned to the output `min`.

4. **Port Declaration**: All ports will be declared as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

5. **No Clock or Reset**: Since there is no mention of a clock or reset, we will not include any sequential logic or reset handling.

module TopModule(

    input logic [7:0] b,
    input logic [7:0] c,
    input logic [7:0] d,
    output logic [7:0] min
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (a < b && a < c && a < d) begin
            min = a;
        end else if (b < c && b < d) begin
            min = b;
        end else if (c < d) begin
            min = c;
        end else begin
            min = d;
        end
