        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - in: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - Represents an 8-bit vector where each bit is indexed from bit[0] (least significant bit) to bit[7] (most significant bit).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - pos: bit[2:0] (3 bits) - Represents the index of the first bit set to '1' in the input vector. If no bits are set, the output should be 3'b000.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a priority encoder for the 8-bit input vector 'in'. The output 'pos' should indicate the index of the least significant bit that is high (1). If the input vector contains no bits that are high, the output 'pos' should be set to 3'b000.\n\nBehavioral Examples:\n- For an input of in = 8'b10010000, the output pos should be 3'd4, as bit[4] is the first bit that is high.\n- For an input of in = 8'b00000000, the output pos should be 3'b000, indicating no bits are high.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The module should be designed as combinational logic, with no internal state or clock dependencies.\n- Ensure that the output 'pos' is valid for all possible input combinations, including edge cases where the input is all zeros.\n- The output should be determined in a single combinational logic evaluation without race conditions.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in  (8 bits)\n - output pos (3 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a priority encoder for an 8-bit input.

For example, the input 8'b10010000 should output 3'd4,\nbecause bit[4] is first bit that is high.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
