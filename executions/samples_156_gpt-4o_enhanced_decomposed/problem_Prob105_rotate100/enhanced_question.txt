Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock. Active on the rising edge.
  - load: 1-bit input signal for loading data into the register. Synchronous active high.
  - ena: 2-bit input signal for enabling rotation and determining the direction of rotation.
  - data: 100-bit input signal representing the data to be loaded into the register.

- Output Ports:
  - q: 100-bit output signal representing the current contents of the rotator.

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a 100-bit left/right rotator with the following behavior:

1. **Load Operation**:
   - When the load signal is high (active), the module loads the input data[99:0] into the output q. This operation occurs synchronously with the clock.

2. **Rotation Control**:
   - The ena input determines the rotation behavior as follows:
     - 2'b01: Rotate the contents of q to the right by one bit. The bit that is shifted out from the least significant bit (LSB) is reintroduced at the most significant bit (MSB).
     - 2'b10: Rotate the contents of q to the left by one bit. The bit that is shifted out from the MSB is reintroduced at the LSB.
     - 2'b00 and 2'b11: No rotation occurs, and the contents of q remain unchanged.

3. **Output**:
   - The output q reflects the current state of the rotator after the load or rotation operation has been performed.

Additional Specifications:
- The module operates synchronously with respect to the clk signal.
- The initial state of the output q should be defined (e.g., all bits set to 0) upon reset or power-up.
- Ensure that all operations are free from race conditions and that the precedence of operations is clearly defined.
- The bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit and bit[99] refers to the most significant bit.
