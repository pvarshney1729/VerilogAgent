Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (4 bits)

The module should implement a decade counter that counts 1 through 10,
inclusive. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge
of the clock. The reset input is active high synchronous, and should
reset the counter to 1.
