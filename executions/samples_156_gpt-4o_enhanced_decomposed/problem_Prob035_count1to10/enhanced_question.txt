Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock. (Positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: 1-bit input signal for synchronous reset. Active high.

- Output Ports:
  - q: 4-bit output signal representing the current count of the decade counter. 
    - Bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB) and Bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Functionality:
- The module implements a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10, inclusive.
- The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- When the reset signal is asserted (active high), the counter resets to the value of 1.

Behavior:
- The counter should only count up to 10 and then roll over to 1.
- The output q should reflect the current count value in binary format.
- Ensure that the counter does not exceed the value of 10; it should reset to 1 after reaching 10.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the output q should be initialized to 0001 (binary representation of 1).

Edge Cases:
- If the reset signal is asserted during a clock cycle, the counter should reset to 1 on the next positive edge of the clk.
- If the counter is at 10 and the clk signal transitions, the next count should be 1.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals.
- Ensure that there are no race conditions between the reset and the counting logic.
