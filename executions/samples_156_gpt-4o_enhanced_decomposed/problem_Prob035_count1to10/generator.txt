<REASONING>
To implement the decade counter as specified, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with a 4-bit output `q` that counts from 1 to 10. The counter should reset to 1 when the `reset` signal is high. The counting should occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, and the reset should be synchronous, meaning it should also be checked on the positive edge of the clock.

1. **Port Declaration**: We will declare the ports as `logic` types as per the coding conventions. The `q` output will be a 4-bit wide signal.

2. **Counter Logic**: We will use a 4-bit register to hold the current count value. The counter will increment on each positive clock edge unless the reset is active.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic will be included within the always block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. If `reset` is high, the counter will be set to 1.

4. **Counting Logic**: If the counter reaches 10, it should wrap around to 1 on the next clock cycle.

5. **Initialization**: Although Verilog does not support initialization in synthesis, we will initialize the counter to zero for simulation purposes.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the count value
    logic [3:0] count;

    // Sequential logic for the decade counter
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 4'd1; // Reset the counter to 1
        end else if (count == 4'd10) begin
            count <= 4'd1; // Wrap around to 1 after reaching 10
        end else begin
            count <= count + 4'd1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end

    // Assign the internal count to the output
    assign q = count;

endmodule
