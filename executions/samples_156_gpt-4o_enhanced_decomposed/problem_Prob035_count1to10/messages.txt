Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock. (Positive edge-triggered)\n  - reset: 1-bit input signal for synchronous reset. Active high.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 4-bit output signal representing the current count of the decade counter. \n    - Bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB) and Bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10, inclusive.\n- The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- When the reset signal is asserted (active high), the counter resets to the value of 1.\n\nBehavior:\n- The counter should only count up to 10 and then roll over to 1.\n- The output q should reflect the current count value in binary format.\n- Ensure that the counter does not exceed the value of 10; it should reset to 1 after reaching 10.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, the output q should be initialized to 0001 (binary representation of 1).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the reset signal is asserted during a clock cycle, the counter should reset to 1 on the next positive edge of the clk.\n- If the counter is at 10 and the clk signal transitions, the next count should be 1.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions between the reset and the counting logic.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

The reset input is active high synchronous, and should\nreset the counter to 1.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
