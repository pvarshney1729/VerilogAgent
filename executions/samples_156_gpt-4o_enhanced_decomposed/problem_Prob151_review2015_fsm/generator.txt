<REASONING>
To implement the finite-state machine (FSM) for the `TopModule`, we need to define several states to handle the sequence detection, shifting, counting, and acknowledgment phases. The FSM will transition through these states based on the input signals and the current state. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **State Definitions**: We need states for:
   - `IDLE`: Waiting for the pattern `1101`.
   - `PATTERN_DETECTED`: Pattern `1101` has been detected.
   - `SHIFT`: Shift in 4 more bits to determine the delay.
   - `COUNT`: Wait for the counting to complete.
   - `DONE`: Notify the user and wait for acknowledgment.

2. **State Transitions**:
   - From `IDLE`, transition to `PATTERN_DETECTED` when the pattern `1101` is detected.
   - From `PATTERN_DETECTED`, transition to `SHIFT` to shift in 4 bits.
   - From `SHIFT`, transition to `COUNT` after 4 clock cycles.
   - From `COUNT`, transition to `DONE` when `done_counting` is high.
   - From `DONE`, transition back to `IDLE` when `ack` is high.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - `shift_ena` is asserted during the `SHIFT` state.
   - `counting` is asserted during the `COUNT` state.
   - `done` is asserted during the `DONE` state.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM should reset to the `IDLE` state on a synchronous reset.

5. **Implementation**: Use an `always_ff` block for the state transitions and an `always_comb` block for the output logic.
