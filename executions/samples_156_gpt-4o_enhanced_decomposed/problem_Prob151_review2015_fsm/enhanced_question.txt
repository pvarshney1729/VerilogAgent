Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - data: 1-bit input (serial data input)
  - done_counting: 1-bit input (indicates that counting is complete)
  - ack: 1-bit input (acknowledgment signal from the user)

- Output Ports:
  - shift_ena: 1-bit output (enables shifting of incoming data)
  - counting: 1-bit output (indicates that the timer is counting)
  - done: 1-bit output (notifies the user that the timer has timed out)

Functional Description:
The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that controls a timer based on the detection of a specific input pattern and manages the timing sequence as follows:

1. **Pattern Detection**: The FSM starts when the input pattern '1101' is detected on the `data` input. The detection of this pattern triggers the timer sequence.

2. **Shifting Data**: Upon detecting the pattern, the FSM asserts the `shift_ena` output for exactly 4 clock cycles. This allows the module to shift in 4 additional bits that determine the duration of the delay.

3. **Counting State**: After the 4 clock cycles of shifting, the FSM asserts the `counting` output to indicate that it is waiting for the counters to finish counting. The FSM remains in this state until the `done_counting` input is asserted high.

4. **Completion Notification**: Once `done_counting` is high, the FSM asserts the `done` output to notify the user that the timer has timed out. The FSM then waits for the `ack` input to be asserted high.

5. **Reset Behavior**: The FSM has an active high synchronous reset. When the `reset` input is asserted, the FSM transitions to the initial state, where it begins searching for the input sequence '1101'.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential elements within the FSM are triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

Initial State:
- Upon reset, the FSM initializes to a state where it is ready to detect the input sequence '1101'.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM should handle cases where the input data may not contain the pattern '1101' and should remain in the initial state until the pattern is detected.

Signal Dependencies:
- The `shift_ena` output is dependent on the detection of the pattern '1101'.
- The `counting` output is asserted after the shifting phase and remains asserted until `done_counting` is high.
- The `done` output is asserted only after `done_counting` is high and remains asserted until `ack` is received.

Bit Indexing:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide, with bit[0] referring to the least significant bit (LSB).
