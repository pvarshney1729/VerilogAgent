<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a 4-bit shift register that can also function as a down counter. The module will have two main operations controlled by `shift_ena` and `count_ena` signals. When `shift_ena` is high, the module should shift in the `data` bit into the most significant bit (MSB) of the register. When `count_ena` is high, the module should decrement the current value in the register. Since the behavior when both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are high is unspecified, we can choose any behavior for this case.

The module will be clocked, and all operations will occur on the positive edge of the clock. We will use a 4-bit register to store the current state of the shift register/counter. The implementation will use an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock to update the register based on the control signals.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic shift_ena,
    input logic count_ena,
    input logic data,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the current state
    logic [3:0] shift_reg;

    // Sequential logic to update the shift register
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (shift_ena) begin
            // Shift in the data bit into the MSB
            shift_reg <= {data, shift_reg[3:1]};
        end else if (count_ena) begin
            // Decrement the current value
            shift_reg <= shift_reg - 1;
        end
        // If both shift_ena and count_ena are high, behavior is unspecified
    end

    // Assign the internal register to the output
    assign q = shift_reg;

endmodule
