Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in; // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire [1:0] state; // 2-bit input representing the current state
- Output Ports:
  - output reg [1:0] next_state; // 2-bit output representing the next state
  - output reg out; // 1-bit output signal

Description:
This module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
- The state machine has four states, encoded as follows:
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table:
The state transitions and output behavior are defined as follows:

| Current State | Input (in) | Next State | Output (out) |
|---------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| A (00)        | 0          | A (00)      | 0            |
| A (00)        | 1          | B (01)      | 0            |
| B (01)        | 0          | C (10)      | 0            |
| B (01)        | 1          | B (01)      | 0            |
| C (10)        | 0          | A (00)      | 0            |
| C (10)        | 1          | D (11)      | 0            |
| D (11)        | 0          | C (10)      | 1            |
| D (11)        | 1          | B (01)      | 1            |

Implementation Notes:
- The module should only implement the combinational logic for state transitions and output generation based on the current state and input.
- The output (out) is determined solely by the current state and does not depend on the input (in) for states A, B, and C.
- The output (out) is asserted (1) only when the state is D and the input is either 0 or 1.

Reset Behavior:
- The module does not specify a reset mechanism; therefore, it is assumed that the initial state is undefined until the first valid input is processed.

Signal Definitions:
- The current state (state) is represented by a 2-bit vector, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[1] is the most significant bit (MSB).
- The next state (next_state) and output (out) are defined as registers to hold their values until the next combinational evaluation.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state transitions and output logic are correctly implemented for all possible combinations of the current state and input.
