Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge triggered)
  - resetn: 1-bit input (synchronous, active low reset)
  - x: 1-bit input (motor control signal)
  - y: 1-bit input (motor control signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - f: 1-bit output (motor control signal)
  - g: 1-bit output (motor control signal)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to control a motor based on inputs x and y. The FSM operates as follows:

1. **Reset Behavior**:
   - When resetn is asserted (active low), the FSM remains in the initial state, referred to as State A.
   - Upon de-assertion of resetn, the FSM transitions to the next state on the subsequent positive edge of clk.

2. **Output f**:
   - After the reset signal is de-asserted, the output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle.

3. **Monitoring Input x**:
   - The FSM monitors the input x for a specific sequence. If x produces the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, the output g is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.

4. **Monitoring Input y**:
   - While g is maintained at 1, the FSM monitors the input y. 
   - If y becomes 1 within two clock cycles after g is set to 1, g remains at 1 permanently (until reset).
   - If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently (until reset).

5. **Sequential Logic**:
   - All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of clk.
   - All registers and flip-flops must have explicitly defined initial values, with the initial state of the FSM being State A.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM must handle cases where the reset signal is asserted during the monitoring of inputs x and y, ensuring that the outputs f and g are reset appropriately.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output g depends on the sequence of input x and the timing of input y after g is set to 1.

Precedence of Operations:
- The FSM must prioritize the reset condition over the monitoring of inputs x and y.
