<REASONING>
To implement the FSM as described, we need to define several states to handle the transitions and outputs based on the inputs `x` and `y`. The FSM will start in state A and transition through other states based on the input conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **State Definitions**: 
   - **State A**: Initial state where the FSM stays as long as `resetn` is asserted. When `resetn` is de-asserted, transition to state B.
   - **State B**: Set `f` to 1 for one clock cycle, then transition to state C.
   - **State C**: Monitor `x` for the sequence 1, 0, 1. Transition to state D if the sequence is detected.
   - **State D**: Set `g` to 1 and monitor `y` for up to two clock cycles.
   - **State E**: If `y` becomes 1 within two clock cycles, maintain `g` = 1 permanently.
   - **State F**: If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, set `g` = 0 permanently.

2. **State Transitions**: 
   - Use a state register to hold the current state and a next state logic to determine the next state based on current state and inputs.
   - Use a counter to track the number of clock cycles in state D to decide whether to transition to state E or F.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - `f` is set to 1 only in state B.
   - `g` is set to 1 in state D and remains 1 in state E. It is set to 0 in state F.

4. **Synchronous Reset**:
   - The reset is synchronous, so it is checked within the clocked always block.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use an enumerated type for state representation for clarity.
   - Use a case statement to handle state transitions and output logic.
