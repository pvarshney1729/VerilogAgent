        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge triggered)\n  - resetn: 1-bit input (synchronous, active low reset)\n  - x: 1-bit input (motor control signal)\n  - y: 1-bit input (motor control signal)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - f: 1-bit output (motor control signal)\n  - g: 1-bit output (motor control signal)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to control a motor based on inputs x and y. The FSM operates as follows:\n\n1. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - When resetn is asserted (active low), the FSM remains in the initial state, referred to as State A.\n   - Upon de-assertion of resetn, the FSM transitions to the next state on the subsequent positive edge of clk.\n\n2. **Output f**:\n   - After the reset signal is de-asserted, the output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle.\n\n3. **Monitoring Input x**:\n   - The FSM monitors the input x for a specific sequence. If x produces the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, the output g is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.\n\n4. **Monitoring Input y**:\n   - While g is maintained at 1, the FSM monitors the input y. \n   - If y becomes 1 within two clock cycles after g is set to 1, g remains at 1 permanently (until reset).\n   - If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently (until reset).\n\n5. **Sequential Logic**:\n   - All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of clk.\n   - All registers and flip-flops must have explicitly defined initial values, with the initial state of the FSM being State A.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM must handle cases where the reset signal is asserted during the monitoring of inputs x and y, ensuring that the outputs f and g are reset appropriately.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output g depends on the sequence of input x and the timing of input y after g is set to 1.\n\nPrecedence of Operations:\n- The FSM must prioritize the reset condition over the monitoring of inputs x and y.\n                    "
