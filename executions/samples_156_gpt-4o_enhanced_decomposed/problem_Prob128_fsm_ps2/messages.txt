        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)\n  - in: 8-bit input (data byte stream)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - done: 1-bit output (indicates the successful receipt of a complete message)\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a continuous byte stream received from a PS/2 mouse protocol. Each message consists of three bytes, and the FSM is responsible for identifying the boundaries of these messages.\n\nMessage Boundary Detection:\n- The FSM will continuously monitor the input byte stream. A message is identified when the first byte of a three-byte message is detected, which is indicated by the condition in[3] = 1.\n- The FSM will discard any bytes until it encounters a byte where in[3] = 1, which will be treated as the first byte of a new message.\n- The FSM will signal the output done = 1 in the clock cycle immediately following the successful receipt of the third byte of each message.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), all internal registers and state variables will be initialized to their default states.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All flip-flops and registers must have explicitly defined initial values upon reset.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should handle cases where no valid messages are received by continuously monitoring the input stream without generating false done signals.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The input port 'in' is indexed such that in[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and in[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n                    "
