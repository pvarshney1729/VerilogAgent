Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (active-high asynchronous reset)\n  - j: 1-bit input (state transition control)\n  - k: 1-bit input (state transition control)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output (current state indication)\n\nState Machine Description:\nThe module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:\n- States: \n  - OFF (output out = 0)\n  - ON (output out = 1)\n\n- State Transition Conditions:\n  - From OFF to OFF: when j = 0 (remains in OFF state)\n  - From OFF to ON: when j = 1 (transitions to ON state)\n  - From ON to ON: when k = 0 (remains in ON state)\n  - From ON to OFF: when k = 1 (transitions to OFF state)\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The areset signal is an active-high asynchronous reset. When areset is asserted (high), the state machine transitions to the OFF state immediately, regardless of the clock signal.\n\nClock Behavior:\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal, except when the areset signal is asserted.\n\nInitial State:\n- Upon reset (when areset is high), the state machine initializes to the OFF state (out = 0).\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- The output out reflects the current state of the state machine, where:\n  - out = 0 indicates the OFF state\n  - out = 1 indicates the ON state\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the state machine handles simultaneous transitions (j and k changing at the same time) according to the defined state transition conditions.\n                    "
