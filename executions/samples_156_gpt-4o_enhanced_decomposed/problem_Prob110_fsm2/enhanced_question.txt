Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - areset: 1-bit input (active-high asynchronous reset)
  - j: 1-bit input (state transition control)
  - k: 1-bit input (state transition control)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (current state indication)

State Machine Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
- States: 
  - OFF (output out = 0)
  - ON (output out = 1)

- State Transition Conditions:
  - From OFF to OFF: when j = 0 (remains in OFF state)
  - From OFF to ON: when j = 1 (transitions to ON state)
  - From ON to ON: when k = 0 (remains in ON state)
  - From ON to OFF: when k = 1 (transitions to OFF state)

Reset Behavior:
- The areset signal is an active-high asynchronous reset. When areset is asserted (high), the state machine transitions to the OFF state immediately, regardless of the clock signal.

Clock Behavior:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal, except when the areset signal is asserted.

Initial State:
- Upon reset (when areset is high), the state machine initializes to the OFF state (out = 0).

Signal Definitions:
- The output out reflects the current state of the state machine, where:
  - out = 0 indicates the OFF state
  - out = 1 indicates the ON state

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state machine handles simultaneous transitions (j and k changing at the same time) according to the defined state transition conditions.
