<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as described, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output `out` is determined solely by the current state. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, which means it should immediately set the state to OFF when asserted, regardless of the clock.

1. **State Encoding**: We can use a single bit to represent the two states:
   - OFF = 0
   - ON = 1

2. **State Transition Logic**:
   - From OFF (state = 0):
     - If `j` is 0, stay in OFF.
     - If `j` is 1, transition to ON.
   - From ON (state = 1):
     - If `k` is 0, stay in ON.
     - If `k` is 1, transition to OFF.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The output `out` is 0 when in the OFF state and 1 when in the ON state.

4. **Asynchronous Reset**:
   - When `areset` is high, the state should be set to OFF immediately.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use an always block sensitive to the clock and asynchronous reset for state transitions.
   - Use a separate always block or continuous assignment for the output logic based on the current state.
