Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)
  - bump_left: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the left)
  - bump_right: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the right)
  - ground: 1-bit input (indicates presence of ground, 1 = present, 0 = absent)
  - dig: 1-bit input (indicates request to dig, 1 = dig, 0 = do not dig)

- Output Ports:
  - walk_left: 1-bit output (indicates walking left, 1 = walking left)
  - walk_right: 1-bit output (indicates walking right, 1 = walking right)
  - aaah: 1-bit output (indicates falling, 1 = falling)
  - digging: 1-bit output (indicates digging, 1 = digging)

Functional Description:
The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of Lemmings in a 2D environment. The Lemmings can be in one of two primary states: 
1. Walking Left (walk_left = 1)
2. Walking Right (walk_right = 1)

State Transitions:
- The Lemming will switch its walking direction based on the following conditions:
  - If bump_left = 1, the Lemming will transition to walking right (walk_right = 1).
  - If bump_right = 1, the Lemming will transition to walking left (walk_left = 1).
  - If both bump_left and bump_right are 1 simultaneously, the Lemming will still switch directions.

Falling Behavior:
- When ground = 0, the Lemming will fall, and the output aaah will be set to 1.
- When ground = 1, the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction it was walking before falling.
- Bumping while falling does not affect the walking direction.
- If bumping occurs in the same clock cycle as ground disappears (ground transitions from 1 to 0), or if ground reappears while the Lemming is still falling, the walking direction remains unchanged.

Digging Behavior:
- The Lemming can dig when it is on the ground (ground = 1) and not falling (aaah = 0).
- Digging starts when dig = 1 and continues until ground = 0.
- Once ground = 0, the Lemming will fall (aaah = 1) and will resume walking in the original direction once ground = 1 again.
- Bumping while digging has no effect on the walking direction.
- Requests to dig while falling or when there is no ground are ignored.

Precedence of Actions:
- The precedence of actions is as follows:
  1. Falling (ground = 0)
  2. Digging (dig = 1)
  3. Switching directions (bump_left or bump_right)

Reset Behavior:
- The areset signal is a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that initializes the Lemming state to walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0).
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Signal Definitions:
- All input and output signals are defined as 1-bit wide.
- The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].
