<REASONING>
To implement the Lemming's behavior as a finite state machine (FSM), we need to define the states and transitions based on the problem description. The states are:

1. WALK_LEFT: The Lemming is walking left.
2. WALK_RIGHT: The Lemming is walking right.
3. FALL_LEFT: The Lemming is falling and was last walking left.
4. FALL_RIGHT: The Lemming is falling and was last walking right.
5. DIG_LEFT: The Lemming is digging and was last walking left.
6. DIG_RIGHT: The Lemming is digging and was last walking right.

The transitions between these states are determined by the inputs: `bump_left`, `bump_right`, `ground`, and `dig`. The priority of actions is:
1. Falling (when `ground` is 0).
2. Digging (when `dig` is 1 and `ground` is 1).
3. Switching directions (when bumped).

The `areset` input is an asynchronous reset that initializes the state to WALK_LEFT.

The outputs are determined by the current state:
- `walk_left` is 1 when in WALK_LEFT.
- `walk_right` is 1 when in WALK_RIGHT.
- `aaah` is 1 when in FALL_LEFT or FALL_RIGHT.
- `digging` is 1 when in DIG_LEFT or DIG_RIGHT.

The FSM will be implemented using a case statement inside an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. The asynchronous reset will be handled separately to ensure the state is set to WALK_LEFT when `areset` is asserted.
