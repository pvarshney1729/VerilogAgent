        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)\n  - bump_left: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the left)\n  - bump_right: 1-bit input (indicates bump from the right)\n  - ground: 1-bit input (indicates presence of ground, 1 = present, 0 = absent)\n  - dig: 1-bit input (indicates request to dig, 1 = dig, 0 = do not dig)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - walk_left: 1-bit output (indicates walking left, 1 = walking left)\n  - walk_right: 1-bit output (indicates walking right, 1 = walking right)\n  - aaah: 1-bit output (indicates falling, 1 = falling)\n  - digging: 1-bit output (indicates digging, 1 = digging)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of Lemmings in a 2D environment. The Lemmings can be in one of two primary states: \n1. Walking Left (walk_left = 1)\n2. Walking Right (walk_right = 1)\n\nState Transitions:\n- The Lemming will switch its walking direction based on the following conditions:\n  - If bump_left = 1, the Lemming will transition to walking right (walk_right = 1).\n  - If bump_right = 1, the Lemming will transition to walking left (walk_left = 1).\n  - If both bump_left and bump_right are 1 simultaneously, the Lemming will still switch directions.\n\nFalling Behavior:\n- When ground = 0, the Lemming will fall, and the output aaah will be set to 1.\n- When ground = 1, the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction it was walking before falling.\n- Bumping while falling does not affect the walking direction.\n- If bumping occurs in the same clock cycle as ground disappears (ground transitions from 1 to 0), or if ground reappears while the Lemming is still falling, the walking direction remains unchanged.\n\nDigging Behavior:\n- The Lemming can dig when it is on the ground (ground = 1) and not falling (aaah = 0).\n- Digging starts when dig = 1 and continues until ground = 0.\n- Once ground = 0, the Lemming will fall (aaah = 1) and will resume walking in the original direction once ground = 1 again.\n- Bumping while digging has no effect on the walking direction.\n- Requests to dig while falling or when there is no ground are ignored.\n\nPrecedence of Actions:\n- The precedence of actions is as follows:\n  1. Falling (ground = 0)\n  2. Digging (dig = 1)\n  3. Switching directions (bump_left or bump_right)\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The areset signal is a positive edge-triggered asynchronous reset that initializes the Lemming state to walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0).\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- All input and output signals are defined as 1-bit wide.\n- The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].\n                    "
