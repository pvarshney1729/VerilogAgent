Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - j: 1-bit input (JK flip-flop input J)
  - k: 1-bit input (JK flip-flop input K)

- Output Ports:
  - Q: 1-bit output (current state of the flip-flop)

Functional Description:
The module implements a JK flip-flop with the following behavior defined by the truth table. The output Q is updated on the rising edge of the clock (clk). The previous state of the output before the clock edge is denoted as Qold.

Truth Table:
  J | K | Q (next state)
  0 | 0 | Qold          // No change
  0 | 1 | 0             // Reset state
  1 | 0 | 1             // Set state
  1 | 1 | ~Qold         // Toggle state

Reset Behavior:
- The flip-flop does not have an asynchronous reset. The output Q retains its state until the next clock edge based on the inputs J and K.

Initial Conditions:
- The initial state of the output Q should be defined. If not specified, it is assumed to be 0 at the start of simulation.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output Q is dependent on the inputs J and K at the rising edge of clk. Ensure that there are no race conditions by properly synchronizing the input signals with the clock.

Edge Case Handling:
- Ensure that the behavior of the flip-flop is well-defined for all combinations of J and K inputs at the clock edge.
