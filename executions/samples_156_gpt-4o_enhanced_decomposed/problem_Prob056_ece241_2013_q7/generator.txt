<REASONING>
To implement a JK flip-flop in Verilog, we need to follow the truth table provided. The JK flip-flop has two inputs, J and K, and one output, Q. The behavior of the flip-flop is determined by the values of J and K at the rising edge of the clock signal. The truth table specifies the following behavior:

- When J = 0 and K = 0, the output Q retains its previous state (Qold).
- When J = 0 and K = 1, the output Q is reset to 0.
- When J = 1 and K = 0, the output Q is set to 1.
- When J = 1 and K = 1, the output Q toggles its state (i.e., Q becomes ~Qold).

The implementation will use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to model the synchronous behavior of the flip-flop. We will declare the ports using the `logic` type as per the coding conventions. The output Q will be initialized to 0 for simulation purposes.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic j,
    input logic k,
    output logic Q
);

    // Initialize Q to 0 for simulation purposes
    initial begin
        Q = 1'b0;
    end

    // Always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        case ({j, k})
            2'b00: Q <= Q;       // Retain the previous state
            2'b01: Q <= 1'b0;    // Reset to 0
            2'b10: Q <= 1'b1;    // Set to 1
            2'b11: Q <= ~Q;      // Toggle the state
        endcase
    end
