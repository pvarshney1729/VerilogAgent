        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)\n  - j: 1-bit input (JK flip-flop input J)\n  - k: 1-bit input (JK flip-flop input K)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - Q: 1-bit output (current state of the flip-flop)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a JK flip-flop with the following behavior defined by the truth table. The output Q is updated on the rising edge of the clock (clk). The previous state of the output before the clock edge is denoted as Qold.\n\nTruth Table:\n  J | K | Q (next state)\n  0 | 0 | Qold          // No change\n  0 | 1 | 0             // Reset state\n  1 | 0 | 1             // Set state\n  1 | 1 | ~Qold         // Toggle state\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The flip-flop does not have an asynchronous reset. The output Q retains its state until the next clock edge based on the inputs J and K.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The initial state of the output Q should be defined. If not specified, it is assumed to be 0 at the start of simulation.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output Q is dependent on the inputs J and K at the rising edge of clk. Ensure that there are no race conditions by properly synchronizing the input signals with the clock.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Ensure that the behavior of the flip-flop is well-defined for all combinations of J and K inputs at the clock edge.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
