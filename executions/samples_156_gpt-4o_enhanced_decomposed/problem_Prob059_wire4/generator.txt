<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with specific input and output connections. The module should act as a simple wire connection between inputs and outputs. According to the problem statement, the connections are as follows:

- Input `a` should be connected to output `w`.
- Input `b` should be connected to outputs `x` and `y`.
- Input `c` should be connected to output `z`.

Since these are direct connections, we can use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) to connect the inputs to the outputs. There is no need for any combinational or sequential logic, as the module simply passes the input signals to the outputs.

The guidelines and coding conventions provided are not directly applicable here since there is no need for synchronous reset, flip-flops, or any complex logic. We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the conventions, even though `wire` would be more typical for such direct connections.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    output logic w,
    output logic x,
    output logic y,
    output logic z
);

    // Direct connections using continuous assignment
    assign w = a;
    assign x = b;
    assign y = b;
    assign z = c;

endmodule
[DONE]
