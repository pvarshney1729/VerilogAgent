<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit [0] (1-bit input, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: bit [0] (1-bit output, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic function that continuously assigns the value of the input port 'in' to the output port 'out'. 

Behavior:
- The output 'out' shall reflect the value of 'in' at all times without any delay or clock dependency.

Edge Cases:
- The module does not have any specific edge cases or input boundaries to handle, as it operates on a single bit input and output.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module.

Timing:
- The module operates purely combinationally, with no sequential elements or clock cycles involved.
