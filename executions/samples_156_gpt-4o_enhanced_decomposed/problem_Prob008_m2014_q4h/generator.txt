<REASONING>
The task is to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single input and a single output, both of which are one bit wide. The requirement is to assign the output to the same value as the input in a combinational manner. This means that the output should immediately reflect any changes in the input without any delay or clock dependency.

Given the simplicity of the task, we can achieve this using a continuous assignment statement. This is the most straightforward approach for combinational logic where the output is directly driven by the input. There is no need for an `always` block since we are not performing any operations that require reading signals or creating a sensitivity list.

The guidelines and conventions provided are more relevant for more complex designs involving sequential logic, synchronous resets, and initialization, which are not applicable in this simple combinational logic scenario.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);
    // Continuous assignment for combinational logic
    assign out = in;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
