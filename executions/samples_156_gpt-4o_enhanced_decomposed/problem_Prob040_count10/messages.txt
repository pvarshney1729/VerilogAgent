        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset signal)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 4-bit output (represents the current count value of the decade counter, where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[3] is the most significant bit (MSB))\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive. The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal and resets to 0 when the reset signal is asserted (active high). The counter should have a period of 10 clock cycles, meaning it will output the values 0 through 9 in binary representation on the q output.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset input is synchronous and active high. When reset is asserted, the counter will immediately reset to 0 (i.e., q = 4'b0000).\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, the output q should be initialized to 4'b0000.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The counter should correctly handle the transition from 9 (4'b1001) back to 0 (4'b0000) on the next clock cycle after reaching the maximum count.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals, with the counter state being updated only on the rising edge of clk when reset is not asserted.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
