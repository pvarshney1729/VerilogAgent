Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (4 bits)

The module should implement a decade counter that counts from 0 through
9, inclusive, with a period of 10. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The reset input is active
high synchronous, and should reset the counter to 0.
