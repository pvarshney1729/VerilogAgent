Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset signal)

- Output Ports:
  - q: 4-bit output (represents the current count value of the decade counter, where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[3] is the most significant bit (MSB))

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive. The counter increments on the positive edge of the clk signal and resets to 0 when the reset signal is asserted (active high). The counter should have a period of 10 clock cycles, meaning it will output the values 0 through 9 in binary representation on the q output.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset input is synchronous and active high. When reset is asserted, the counter will immediately reset to 0 (i.e., q = 4'b0000).

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the output q should be initialized to 4'b0000.

Edge Cases:
- The counter should correctly handle the transition from 9 (4'b1001) back to 0 (4'b0000) on the next clock cycle after reaching the maximum count.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is dependent on the clk and reset signals, with the counter state being updated only on the rising edge of clk when reset is not asserted.
