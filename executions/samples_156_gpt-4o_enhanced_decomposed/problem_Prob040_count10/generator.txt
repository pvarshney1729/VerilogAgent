<REASONING>
To implement the decade counter, we need a 4-bit counter that counts from 0 to 9. The counter should reset to 0 when the reset signal is high. The counting operation is synchronous with the clock, meaning it updates on the positive edge of the clock. The reset is also synchronous, so it should be checked within the clock edge-triggered always block. The counter should wrap around to 0 after reaching 9. We will use a 4-bit register to hold the current count value and update it based on the clock and reset conditions.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [3:0] q
);

    // Internal register to hold the count value
    logic [3:0] count;

    // Sequential logic for the decade counter
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 4'd0; // Reset the counter to 0
        end else if (count == 4'd9) begin
            count <= 4'd0; // Wrap around to 0 after reaching 9
        end else begin
            count <= count + 4'd1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end

    // Assign the internal count to the output
    assign q = count;

endmodule
