<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit [0] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - b: bit [0] (1-bit input, unsigned)

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit [0] (1-bit output, unsigned)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a 2-input NOR gate. The output 'out' is high (1) only when both inputs 'a' and 'b' are low (0). The truth table for the NOR operation is as follows:

| a | b | out |
|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 |  1  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is combinationally dependent on the inputs 'a' and 'b'.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible input combinations of 'a' and 'b' without any undefined behavior.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module as it is purely combinational logic.

Initial Values:
- The output 'out' does not require an initial value specification as it is determined solely by the current values of inputs 'a' and 'b'.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the implementation adheres to the specified behavior of the NOR gate without introducing any race conditions or unintended delays.
