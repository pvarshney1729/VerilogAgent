<REASONING>
To implement a NOR gate in Verilog, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with the specified interface. The NOR gate is a digital logic gate that outputs true or high only when both inputs are false or low. In Verilog, this can be implemented using the NOR operator (`~|`). The module will have two inputs, `a` and `b`, and one output, `out`. Since the task is to implement a simple combinational logic gate, we will use an `assign` statement to directly assign the NOR operation result to the output. This approach is efficient and adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing NOR gate using assign statement
    assign out = ~(a | b);
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing NOR gate using assign statement
    assign out = ~(a | b);
endmodule
