<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a module with a 100-bit input and three 1-bit outputs. The outputs are the result of applying bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations across all 100 input bits. Since these operations are purely combinational, we will use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) to compute the outputs. This approach is efficient and straightforward for combinational logic, as it directly maps the operations to hardware without the need for an `always` block.

1. **Input and Output Declaration**: We will declare the input as a 100-bit vector and the outputs as single-bit signals.
2. **Bitwise Operations**: 
   - `out_and` will be the result of a bitwise AND operation across all bits of the input vector.
   - `out_or` will be the result of a bitwise OR operation across all bits of the input vector.
   - `out_xor` will be the result of a bitwise XOR operation across all bits of the input vector.
3. **Use of `assign` Statements**: Since the operations are combinational, we will use `assign` statements to continuously drive the outputs based on the input.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [99:0] in,
    output logic out_and,
    output logic out_or,
    output logic out_xor
);

    // Combinational logic for 100-input AND gate
    assign out_and = &in;

    // Combinational logic for 100-input OR gate
    assign out_or = |in;

    // Combinational logic for 100-input XOR gate
    assign out_xor = ^in;

endmodule
[DONE]
