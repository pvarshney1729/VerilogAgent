Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - in: bit[99:0] (100 bits, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[99] is the most significant bit (MSB))\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out_and: bit (1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input AND operation)\n  - out_or: bit (1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input OR operation)\n  - out_xor: bit (1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input XOR operation)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic circuit that processes 100 input bits. The outputs are defined as follows:\n1. out_and: This output is the logical AND of all 100 input bits (in[99:0]). The output will be high (1) only if all input bits are high (1); otherwise, it will be low (0).\n2. out_or: This output is the logical OR of all 100 input bits (in[99:0]). The output will be high (1) if at least one input bit is high (1); otherwise, it will be low (0).\n3. out_xor: This output is the logical XOR of all 100 input bits (in[99:0]). The output will be high (1) if an odd number of input bits are high (1); otherwise, it will be low (0).\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The module is purely combinational; there are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved.\n- There are no resets or initial values to define, as the outputs are determined solely by the current state of the inputs.\n- Ensure that the logic for each output is implemented without race conditions, considering the precedence of operations as defined by standard logical operations.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
