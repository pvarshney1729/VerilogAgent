<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a state machine that controls the flow rate based on the water level indicated by the sensors. The sensors are represented by a 3-bit input `s`, where each bit corresponds to a sensor being asserted or not. The outputs `fr2`, `fr1`, `fr0`, and `dfr` control the flow rate valves.

1. **State Machine Design**: 
   - We need to track the previous water level to determine if the water level is rising or falling.
   - The state machine will have states corresponding to the water levels: "Above s[2]", "Between s[2] and s[1]", "Between s[1] and s[0]", and "Below s[0]".

2. **Output Logic**:
   - Based on the current state and the previous state, determine the outputs `fr2`, `fr1`, `fr0`, and `dfr`.
   - If the water level is rising, `dfr` should be asserted to open the Supplemental flow valve.

3. **Synchronous Reset**:
   - The reset should initialize the state machine to a state where all outputs are asserted, simulating a low water level condition.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use an always block for sequential logic with a synchronous reset.
   - Use another always block for combinational logic to determine the outputs based on the current state and previous state.
