Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Ports:
  - zero: bit[0] (1-bit output)

Functional Description:
- The module shall continuously output a logic LOW (0) on the output port 'zero'.
- The output 'zero' is defined as follows:
  - zero = 1'b0

Behavioral Characteristics:
- The output 'zero' is combinational and does not depend on any input signals or clock cycles.
- There are no edge cases or input boundaries to consider, as the module does not take any input signals.

Reset Behavior:
- No reset functionality is required for this module.

Initial State:
- The output 'zero' shall be initialized to 1'b0, ensuring it outputs LOW at all times.

Timing:
- The output is stable and does not change over time, as it is a constant LOW output.
