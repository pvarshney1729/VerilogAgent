<REASONING>
The task is to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single output port named `zero` that always outputs a LOW signal. Since the output is always LOW, there is no need for any input ports or internal logic to determine the output value. The simplest way to achieve this is by using an `assign` statement to directly set the output to 0. This approach adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, as it does not require any sensitivity list or always block, and it uses a sized numeric constant for the output value.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic zero
);
    // Assign the output to a constant LOW value
    assign zero = 1'b0;
endmodule
[DONE]
