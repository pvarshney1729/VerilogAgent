        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - resetn: 1-bit input (active-low synchronous reset)\n  - in: 1-bit input (data input for the shift register)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output (data output from the last D flip-flop in the shift register)\n\nFunctionality:\nThe module implements a 4-stage shift register using four D flip-flops (DFFs). The DFFs are arranged in a series configuration where the output of each DFF is connected to the input of the next DFF. The behavior of the shift register is as follows:\n\n1. On the positive edge of the clk signal:\n   - If resetn is low (active), all DFFs are reset to 0.\n   - If resetn is high (inactive), the data input (in) is shifted into the first DFF, and the outputs of the DFFs are shifted accordingly. The output (out) reflects the value of the last DFF.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous and active-low. When resetn is low, all DFFs are set to 0.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The output out corresponds to the output of the fourth DFF (DFF3), which is the most significant bit (MSB) of the shift register.\n\nInitial Values:\n- All DFFs should be initialized to 0 upon reset.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the module handles the transition of resetn correctly, maintaining stable operation during clock cycles when resetn transitions from low to high.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
