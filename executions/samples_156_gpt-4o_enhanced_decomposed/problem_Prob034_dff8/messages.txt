Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input signal (clock), active on the rising edge.\n  - d: 8-bit input signal (data), where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 8-bit output signal (data), where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module shall instantiate 8 D flip-flops (DFFs), each corresponding to one bit of the input data signal 'd'.\n- Each DFF shall be triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'.\n- The output 'q' shall reflect the state of the DFFs after the clock edge, such that:\n  - q[0] = d[0] (after the clock edge)\n  - q[1] = d[1] (after the clock edge)\n  - q[2] = d[2] (after the clock edge)\n  - q[3] = d[3] (after the clock edge)\n  - q[4] = d[4] (after the clock edge)\n  - q[5] = d[5] (after the clock edge)\n  - q[6] = d[6] (after the clock edge)\n  - q[7] = d[7] (after the clock edge)\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module does not specify a reset mechanism. If a reset is required, it should be defined in future specifications.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The initial state of the output 'q' is undefined until the first clock edge occurs.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle the scenario where 'd' is not stable at the clock edge, but the behavior in such cases is not defined in this specification.\n\nTiming:\n- The timing relationship between the input 'd' and output 'q' is determined by the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

All DFFs should be triggered by\nthe positive edge of clock.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
