Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal, active high)
  - train_valid: 1-bit input (indicates if training is valid)
  - train_taken: 1-bit input (indicates if training was taken)

- Output Ports:
  - state: 2-bit output (represents the current value of the saturating counter, where state[1] is the most significant bit (MSB) and state[0] is the least significant bit (LSB))

Functional Description:
The module implements a two-bit saturating counter with the following behavior:
- The counter increments by 1 (up to a maximum value of 3) when both train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 1.
- The counter decrements by 1 (down to a minimum value of 0) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0.
- When train_valid = 0, the counter retains its current value and does not change.
- The counter is reset asynchronously to the value of 2'b01 (weakly not-taken) on the positive edge of the areset signal.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic, including the counter updates, is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The counter should have an explicitly defined initial value of 2'b01 upon reset.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the counter does not exceed the maximum value of 3 or fall below the minimum value of 0 during increments and decrements.
- The behavior of the counter should be clearly defined for all combinations of train_valid and train_taken inputs, especially during transitions.

Reset Behavior:
- The areset signal is asynchronous and active high, meaning that when areset is asserted, the counter will immediately reset to 2'b01, regardless of the clk signal state.
