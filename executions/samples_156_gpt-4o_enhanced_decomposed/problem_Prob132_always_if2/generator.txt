<REASONING>
The original module has a bug because it does not handle the case where the conditions for `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` are not met. In such cases, the outputs should be explicitly set to a default value (e.g., 0) to avoid latches. This can be achieved by ensuring that all possible conditions are covered in the combinational logic, or by initializing the outputs to a default value at the beginning of the always block.

Additionally, the original code uses `reg` for outputs, which is acceptable in Verilog, but the guidelines suggest using `logic` for all signals. We will adhere to this convention.

We will also ensure that the outputs are set to a default value at the beginning of each always block to prevent unintended latches.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic cpu_overheated,
    output logic shut_off_computer,
    input logic arrived,
    input logic gas_tank_empty,
    output logic keep_driving
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Default value to prevent latches
        shut_off_computer = 0;
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        // Default value to prevent latches
        keep_driving = 0;
        if (~arrived)
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
    end
