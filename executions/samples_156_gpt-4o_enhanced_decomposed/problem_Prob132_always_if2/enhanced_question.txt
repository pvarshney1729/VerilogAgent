Consider the following adder-subtractor with a zero flag:

  module TopModule (
      input      cpu_overheated,           // Input signal indicating if the CPU is overheating
      output reg shut_off_computer,        // Output signal to shut off the computer
      input      arrived,                   // Input signal indicating if the destination has been reached
      input      gas_tank_empty,           // Input signal indicating if the gas tank is empty
      output reg keep_driving               // Output signal to indicate whether to keep driving
  );

      // Combinational logic to determine if the computer should be shut off
      always @(*) begin
          shut_off_computer = 1'b0;          // Default state
          if (cpu_overheated) begin
             shut_off_computer = 1'b1;      // Set to 1 if CPU is overheating
          end
      end

      // Combinational logic to determine if driving should continue
      always @(*) begin
          keep_driving = 1'b0;               // Default state
          if (~arrived) begin
             keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty; // Continue driving if not arrived and gas tank is not empty
          end
      end

  endmodule
