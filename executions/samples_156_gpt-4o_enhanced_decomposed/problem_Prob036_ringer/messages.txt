        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - wire ring: 1-bit input signal indicating an incoming call (ring[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  - wire vibrate_mode: 1-bit input signal indicating whether the phone is in vibrate mode (vibrate_mode[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - reg ringer: 1-bit output signal controlling the ringer (ringer[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n  - reg motor: 1-bit output signal controlling the vibration motor (motor[0] refers to the least significant bit).\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a control circuit for a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor based on the following logic:\n1. When an incoming call is detected (ring = 1):\n   - If the phone is in vibrate mode (vibrate_mode = 1), the output motor should be activated (motor = 1) and the ringer should be deactivated (ringer = 0).\n   - If the phone is not in vibrate mode (vibrate_mode = 0), the output ringer should be activated (ringer = 1) and the motor should be deactivated (motor = 0).\n2. If there is no incoming call (ring = 0), both outputs should be deactivated (ringer = 0, motor = 0).\n\nReset Conditions:\n- The outputs (ringer and motor) should be initialized to 0 (deactivated) upon reset.\n- The reset should be asynchronous, meaning that the outputs will immediately reflect the reset state regardless of the clock signal.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The outputs ringer and motor are mutually exclusive; only one can be active at any given time when an incoming call is detected.\n- Ensure that the logic correctly handles the transition between states without race conditions.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If both inputs (ring and vibrate_mode) are low (0), both outputs should remain low (0).\n- If the inputs change while the phone is ringing, the outputs should update immediately according to the defined logic.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

If the phone is in\nvibrate mode (input vibrate_mode = 1), turn on the motor. Otherwise, turn\non the ringer.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
