Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - A: 2-bit vector (A[1:0]), where A[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and A[1] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n  - B: 2-bit vector (B[1:0]), where B[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and B[1] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - z: 1-bit output signal.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit that compares the two 2-bit input vectors A and B. The output z is defined as follows:\n- z = 1 if A equals B (i.e., A[1:0] == B[1:0])\n- z = 0 if A does not equal B (i.e., A[1:0] != B[1:0])\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The comparison of A and B should be performed in a single clock cycle.\n- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets defined for this module.\n- The output z should be stable and reflect the comparison result immediately after the inputs A and B are stable.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible combinations of the 2-bit inputs A and B, which range from 00 to 11 in binary.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output z is directly dependent on the values of inputs A and B. There are no additional signals or conditions affecting the output.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

The value of z should be 1 if A =\nB, otherwise z should be 0.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
