Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - A: 2-bit vector (A[1:0]), where A[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and A[1] is the most significant bit (MSB).
  - B: 2-bit vector (B[1:0]), where B[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and B[1] is the most significant bit (MSB).
  
- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit that compares the two 2-bit input vectors A and B. The output z is defined as follows:
- z = 1 if A equals B (i.e., A[1:0] == B[1:0])
- z = 0 if A does not equal B (i.e., A[1:0] != B[1:0])

Behavioral Specifications:
- The comparison of A and B should be performed in a single clock cycle.
- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets defined for this module.
- The output z should be stable and reflect the comparison result immediately after the inputs A and B are stable.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible combinations of the 2-bit inputs A and B, which range from 00 to 11 in binary.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z is directly dependent on the values of inputs A and B. There are no additional signals or conditions affecting the output.
