<REASONING>
To implement a D flip-flop in Verilog, we need to create a module that captures the value of the input `d` on the rising edge of the clock `clk` and outputs it as `q`. The module interface specifies three ports: `clk`, `d`, and `q`, all of which are one-bit signals. Since the task does not mention a reset signal, we will implement a simple D flip-flop without reset functionality. The flip-flop will be triggered on the positive edge of the clock, as specified. We will use an `always` block to describe the sequential behavior of the flip-flop.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
