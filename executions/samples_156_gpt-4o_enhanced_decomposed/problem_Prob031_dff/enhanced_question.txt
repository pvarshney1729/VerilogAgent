Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - d: 1-bit input (data input for the D flip-flop)
- Output Ports:
  - q: 1-bit output (data output from the D flip-flop)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a single D flip-flop. The flip-flop captures the value of the input 'd' on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal and holds this value at the output 'q' until the next rising edge of 'clk'.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The output 'q' is updated synchronously with the clock signal 'clk'.
- The initial state of 'q' is undefined; it should be explicitly initialized in the implementation.
- The module does not include any reset functionality; therefore, no reset conditions are specified.

Timing Specifications:
- The D flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.

Edge Cases:
- The module does not handle asynchronous resets or any other edge cases beyond the standard operation of a D flip-flop.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'q' depends solely on the input 'd' at the moment of the rising edge of 'clk'.
