Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)\n  - d: 1-bit input (data input for the D flip-flop)\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 1-bit output (data output from the D flip-flop)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a single D flip-flop. The flip-flop captures the value of the input 'd' on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal and holds this value at the output 'q' until the next rising edge of 'clk'.\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The output 'q' is updated synchronously with the clock signal 'clk'.\n- The initial state of 'q' is undefined; it should be explicitly initialized in the implementation.\n- The module does not include any reset functionality; therefore, no reset conditions are specified.\n\nTiming Specifications:\n- The D flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module does not handle asynchronous resets or any other edge cases beyond the standard operation of a D flip-flop.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'q' depends solely on the input 'd' at the moment of the rising edge of 'clk'.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

Assume all sequential\nlogic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
