The module produces seven outputs, each corresponding to the result of a specific logical operation performed on the inputs:\n\n1. out_and = a AND b\n2. out_or = a OR b\n3. out_xor = a XOR b\n4. out_nand = a NAND b\n5. out_nor = a NOR b\n6. out_xnor = a XNOR b\n7. out_anotb = a AND (NOT b)\n\nBehavioral Characteristics:\n- The outputs are updated immediately based on the values of inputs a and b, with no clock cycles involved, indicating purely combinational logic.\n- There are no edge cases or input boundaries to consider, as the inputs are strictly 1-bit signals.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
