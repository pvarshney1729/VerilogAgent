Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input representing the first operand
  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input representing the second operand

- Output Ports:
  - output logic out_and;   // 1-bit output for logical AND of a and b
  - output logic out_or;    // 1-bit output for logical OR of a and b
  - output logic out_xor;   // 1-bit output for logical XOR of a and b
  - output logic out_nand;  // 1-bit output for logical NAND of a and b
  - output logic out_nor;   // 1-bit output for logical NOR of a and b
  - output logic out_xnor;  // 1-bit output for logical XNOR of a and b
  - output logic out_anotb; // 1-bit output for logical AND of a and NOT b

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit with two 1-bit inputs, a and b. The module produces seven outputs, each corresponding to the result of a specific logical operation performed on the inputs:

1. out_and = a AND b
2. out_or = a OR b
3. out_xor = a XOR b
4. out_nand = a NAND b
5. out_nor = a NOR b
6. out_xnor = a XNOR b
7. out_anotb = a AND (NOT b)

Behavioral Characteristics:
- The outputs are updated immediately based on the values of inputs a and b, with no clock cycles involved, indicating purely combinational logic.
- There are no edge cases or input boundaries to consider, as the inputs are strictly 1-bit signals.
