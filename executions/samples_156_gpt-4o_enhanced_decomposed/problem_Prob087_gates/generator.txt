<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a combinational logic circuit with two inputs, `a` and `b`, and seven outputs, each driven by a specific logic operation. The operations are straightforward and involve basic logic gates: AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and AND-NOT. Since this is a purely combinational circuit, we will use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) to directly map the logic operations to the outputs. This approach is efficient and adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided.

Each output will be assigned using the appropriate bitwise operation:
1. `out_and` will be the result of `a & b`.
2. `out_or` will be the result of `a | b`.
3. `out_xor` will be the result of `a ^ b`.
4. `out_nand` will be the result of `~(a & b)`.
5. `out_nor` will be the result of `~(a | b)`.
6. `out_xnor` will be the result of `a ~^ b`.
7. `out_anotb` will be the result of `a & ~b`.

No synchronous reset or clock is needed as this is a purely combinational design. We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions.
