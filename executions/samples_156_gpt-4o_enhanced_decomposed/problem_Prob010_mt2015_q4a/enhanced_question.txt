<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - x: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  - y: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)
  
- Output Ports:
  - z: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned)

Functional Description:
The module implements the boolean function defined as:
z = (x XOR y) AND x

Signal Definitions:
- The input signals x and y are treated as unsigned 1-bit values.
- The output signal z is also a 1-bit unsigned value.

Behavioral Specification:
- The output z is combinationally derived from the inputs x and y.
- The operation is performed as follows:
  1. Compute the XOR of inputs x and y.
  2. Perform a bitwise AND operation between the result of the XOR and input x to produce output z.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible combinations of input values (0 or 1 for both x and y).
- The output z should be updated immediately based on changes in inputs x or y without any delay.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic.

Timing:
- The module operates under combinational logic principles, with no clock cycles or sequential elements involved.
