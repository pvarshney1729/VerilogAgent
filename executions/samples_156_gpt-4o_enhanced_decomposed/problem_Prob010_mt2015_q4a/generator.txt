<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule` with the specified interface, we need to create a Verilog module that takes two 1-bit inputs, `x` and `y`, and produces a 1-bit output `z`. The boolean function to be implemented is `z = (x ^ y) & x`. This function uses the XOR operation between `x` and `y`, and then performs an AND operation with `x`.

Given the guidelines and coding conventions:
1. We will declare all ports as `logic` since this is the preferred style over `wire` or `reg`.
2. Since the function is purely combinational, we will use an `assign` statement to directly compute the output `z`.
3. There is no need for a clock or reset signal as the function is combinational and does not involve any sequential logic or state elements.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic x,
    input logic y,
    output logic z
);
    // Implement the boolean function z = (x ^ y) & x
    assign z = (x ^ y) & x;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
