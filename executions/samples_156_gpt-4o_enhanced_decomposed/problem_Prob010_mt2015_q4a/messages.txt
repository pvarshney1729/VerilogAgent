Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - x: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  - y: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - z: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements the boolean function defined as:\nz = (x XOR y) AND x\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- The input signals x and y are treated as unsigned 1-bit values.\n- The output signal z is also a 1-bit unsigned value.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n- The output z is combinationally derived from the inputs x and y.\n- The operation is performed as follows:\n  1. Compute the XOR of inputs x and y.\n  2. Perform a bitwise AND operation between the result of the XOR and input x to produce output z.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible combinations of input values (0 or 1 for both x and y).\n- The output z should be updated immediately based on changes in inputs x or y without any delay.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic.\n\nTiming:\n- The module operates under combinational logic principles, with no clock cycles or sequential elements involved.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  x\n - input  y\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement the boolean function z = (x^y) & x.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
