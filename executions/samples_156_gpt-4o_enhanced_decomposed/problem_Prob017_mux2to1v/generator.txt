<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as a 2-to-1 multiplexer with 100-bit wide inputs and output, we need to select between two 100-bit inputs `a` and `b` based on the value of the 1-bit input `sel`. If `sel` is 0, the output `out` should be equal to `a`. If `sel` is 1, the output `out` should be equal to `b`. This can be achieved using a simple conditional operator in Verilog, which is suitable for combinational logic. Since the task does not require a clock or reset, we will use an `assign` statement to directly drive the output based on the inputs.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [99:0] a,
    input logic [99:0] b,
    input logic sel,
    output logic [99:0] out
);

    // Implementing the 2-to-1 multiplexer
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
[DONE]
