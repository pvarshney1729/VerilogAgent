Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - a: bit[99:0] (100 bits, unsigned) - First input data\n  - b: bit[99:0] (100 bits, unsigned) - Second input data\n  - sel: bit (1 bit, unsigned) - Select signal for multiplexer\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: bit[99:0] (100 bits, unsigned) - Output data from the multiplexer\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer. The output 'out' is determined by the value of the select signal 'sel':\n- When sel = 0, out = a\n- When sel = 1, out = b\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- The input signals 'a' and 'b' are 100 bits wide, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[99] representing the most significant bit (MSB).\n- The select signal 'sel' is a single bit that determines which input is routed to the output.\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The module should be combinational logic, with no internal state or clock cycles involved.\n- There are no resets or initial values required for this module, as it is purely combinational.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle all possible values of 'sel' (0 or 1) without any undefined behavior.\n- The output 'out' should always reflect the current state of the selected input based on 'sel'.\n\nImplementation Considerations:\n- Ensure that the selection logic is implemented without race conditions, providing stable output for all input combinations.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  a   (100 bits)\n - input  b   (100 bits)\n - input  sel\n - output out (100 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a 2-1 multiplexer. When sel=0, choose a. When\nsel=1, choose b.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
