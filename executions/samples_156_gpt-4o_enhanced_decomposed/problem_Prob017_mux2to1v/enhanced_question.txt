Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit[99:0] (100 bits, unsigned) - First input data
  - b: bit[99:0] (100 bits, unsigned) - Second input data
  - sel: bit (1 bit, unsigned) - Select signal for multiplexer

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit[99:0] (100 bits, unsigned) - Output data from the multiplexer

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer. The output 'out' is determined by the value of the select signal 'sel':
- When sel = 0, out = a
- When sel = 1, out = b

Signal Definitions:
- The input signals 'a' and 'b' are 100 bits wide, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[99] representing the most significant bit (MSB).
- The select signal 'sel' is a single bit that determines which input is routed to the output.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The module should be combinational logic, with no internal state or clock cycles involved.
- There are no resets or initial values required for this module, as it is purely combinational.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible values of 'sel' (0 or 1) without any undefined behavior.
- The output 'out' should always reflect the current state of the selected input based on 'sel'.

Implementation Considerations:
- Ensure that the selection logic is implemented without race conditions, providing stable output for all input combinations.
