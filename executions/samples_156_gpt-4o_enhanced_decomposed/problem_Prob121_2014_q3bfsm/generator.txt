<REASONING>
To implement the finite-state machine (FSM) as described, we need to follow these steps:

1. **State Encoding**: The FSM has five states, which are encoded as 3-bit values (y[2:0]). The states are 000, 001, 010, 011, and 100.

2. **State Transition Logic**: Based on the input `x`, the FSM transitions between states as specified in the table. We will implement this logic using a combinational always block.

3. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined by the current state. It is `1` for states 011 and 100, and `0` for the other states.

4. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM should reset to state 000 when the `reset` signal is high on the positive edge of the clock.

5. **Sequential Logic**: The state transitions should occur on the positive edge of the clock, considering the synchronous reset.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and ensure that the reset is handled synchronously without including it in the sensitivity list of the sequential always block.

module TopModule(
    input logic clk,

    input logic x,

        S1 = 3'b001,
        S2 = 3'b010,
        S3 = 3'b011,
        S4 = 3'b100
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            S0: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? S0 : S1;
            S1: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? S1 : S4;
            S2: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? S2 : S1;
            S3: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? S1 : S2;
            S4: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ? S3 : S4;
            default: next_state = S0; // Default case for safety
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)

            default: z = 1'b0;

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= S0;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
