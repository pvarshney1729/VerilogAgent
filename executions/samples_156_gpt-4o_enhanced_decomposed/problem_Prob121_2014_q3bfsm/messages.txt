Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (synchronous active-high reset)\n  - x: 1-bit input (data signal)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - z: 1-bit output (output signal)\n\nFinite-State Machine (FSM) Specification:\n- The FSM has a 3-bit state representation, denoted as y[2:0], where:\n  - y[2] is the most significant bit (MSB)\n  - y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)\n\nState Transition Table:\n- The FSM operates based on the following state transition logic:\n\n| Present State y[2:0] | Next State y[2:0] (x=0) | Next State y[2:0] (x=1) | Output z |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| 000                   | 000                      | 001                      | 0        |\n| 001                   | 001                      | 100                      | 0        |\n| 010                   | 010                      | 001                      | 0        |\n| 011                   | 001                      | 010                      | 1        |\n| 100                   | 011                      | 100                      | 1        |\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active high. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), the FSM transitions to the initial state y[2:0] = 000 on the next positive edge of clk.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All state transitions and output logic are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nInitial State:\n- Upon reset, the state of the FSM is initialized to y[2:0] = 000.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should handle all input combinations of x (0 and 1) as specified in the state transition table without undefined behavior.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output z is determined solely by the current state y[2:0] and the input x, as defined in the state transition table.\n                    "
