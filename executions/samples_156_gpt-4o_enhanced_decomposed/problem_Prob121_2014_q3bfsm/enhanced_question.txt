Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: 1-bit input (synchronous active-high reset)
  - x: 1-bit input (data signal)

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output (output signal)

Finite-State Machine (FSM) Specification:
- The FSM has a 3-bit state representation, denoted as y[2:0], where:
  - y[2] is the most significant bit (MSB)
  - y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)

State Transition Table:
- The FSM operates based on the following state transition logic:

| Present State y[2:0] | Next State y[2:0] (x=0) | Next State y[2:0] (x=1) | Output z |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| 000                   | 000                      | 001                      | 0        |
| 001                   | 001                      | 100                      | 0        |
| 010                   | 010                      | 001                      | 0        |
| 011                   | 001                      | 010                      | 1        |
| 100                   | 011                      | 100                      | 1        |

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous and active high. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), the FSM transitions to the initial state y[2:0] = 000 on the next positive edge of clk.

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and output logic are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Initial State:
- Upon reset, the state of the FSM is initialized to y[2:0] = 000.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM should handle all input combinations of x (0 and 1) as specified in the state transition table without undefined behavior.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z is determined solely by the current state y[2:0] and the input x, as defined in the state transition table.
