Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire in1: 1-bit input signal.
  - input wire in2: 1-bit input signal.
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: 1-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
The module implements a digital logic circuit where the output 'out' is derived from the logical AND operation of two input signals, in1 and in2. However, the input in2 is inverted (bubbled) before being fed into the AND gate. 

Logic Operation:
- The output 'out' is defined as:
  out = in1 AND (NOT in2)

Signal Characteristics:
- All input and output ports are defined as 1-bit wide.
- The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the logical operations are correctly implemented to reflect the intended behavior of the circuit.
- Confirm that there are no race conditions in the signal processing.
