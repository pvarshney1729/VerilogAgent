<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 100 bits
  - Description: A 100-bit wide input signal. The least significant bit (LSB) is bit[0] and the most significant bit (MSB) is bit[99].

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 100 bits
  - Description: A 100-bit wide output signal that will hold the reversed bit ordering of the input signal. The LSB is bit[0] and the MSB is bit[99].

Functional Description:
- The module shall reverse the bit ordering of the input signal 'in' and assign the result to the output signal 'out'. Specifically, the output 'out' shall be defined as:
  - out[0] = in[99]
  - out[1] = in[98]
  - ...
  - out[99] = in[0]

Behavioral Specifications:
- The operation is combinational, meaning that the output 'out' is immediately updated based on the current value of the input 'in' without any clock cycles or delays.
- There are no resets or initial values required for this module, as it does not contain any state-holding elements.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all 100-bit input values, including all possible combinations of 0s and 1s, ensuring that the output correctly reflects the reversed order for any valid input.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output 'out' is directly dependent on the input 'in'. Any change in 'in' will result in an immediate change in 'out' due to the combinational nature of the logic.
