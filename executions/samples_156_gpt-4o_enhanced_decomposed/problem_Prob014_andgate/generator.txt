<REASONING>
To implement a 2-input AND gate in Verilog, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with two input ports `a` and `b`, and one output port `out`. The AND gate will perform a bitwise AND operation on the inputs `a` and `b`, and the result will be assigned to the output `out`. Since this is a simple combinational logic, we will use an `assign` statement to directly assign the result of the AND operation to the output. This approach adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, such as using `logic` for port declarations and using an `assign` statement for combinational logic.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing a 2-input AND gate
    assign out = a & b;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>

module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing a 2-input AND gate
    assign out = a & b;
endmodule
