Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - a: bit [0] (1-bit input, least significant bit)
  - b: bit [0] (1-bit input, least significant bit)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: bit [0] (1-bit output, least significant bit)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit that performs a logical AND operation on the two input signals, a and b. The output signal, out, will be high (1) if both inputs a and b are high (1); otherwise, it will be low (0).

Behavioral Specifications:
- The output out is defined as follows:
  - out = a AND b
- The module does not include any sequential logic elements, thus there are no clock cycles or reset conditions to specify.

Edge Cases:
- When either input a or input b is low (0), the output out will be low (0).
- When both inputs a and b are high (1), the output out will be high (1).

Initial Conditions:
- There are no registers or flip-flops in this module, so initial values are not applicable.
