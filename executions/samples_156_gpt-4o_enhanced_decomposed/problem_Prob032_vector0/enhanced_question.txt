Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - vec: bit[2:0] (3 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 3-bit input vector. 
    - Bit Indexing: 
      - bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
      - bit[2] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - outv: bit[2:0] (3 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: Outputs the same 3-bit vector as the input vec.
  - o0: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Outputs the value of vec[0] (the LSB of the input vector).
  - o1: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Outputs the value of vec[1].
  - o2: bit (1 bit, unsigned)
    - Description: Outputs the value of vec[2] (the MSB of the input vector).

Functional Description:
- The module takes a 3-bit input vector (vec) and produces two types of outputs:
  1. A 3-bit output (outv) that is a direct copy of the input vector.
  2. Three separate 1-bit outputs (o0, o1, o2) that correspond to each bit of the input vector:
     - o0 = vec[0]
     - o1 = vec[1]
     - o2 = vec[2]

Behavioral Notes:
- The outputs o0, o1, and o2 are combinational and directly reflect the corresponding bits of the input vector vec.
- There are no synchronous or asynchronous resets defined for this module.
- The module does not include any sequential logic elements; all outputs are derived from the input in a combinational manner.
