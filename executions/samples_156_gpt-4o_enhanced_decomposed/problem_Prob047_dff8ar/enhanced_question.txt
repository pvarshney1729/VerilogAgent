Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - areset: 1-bit input (active high asynchronous reset signal)
  - d: 8-bit input (data input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)

- Output Ports:
  - q: 8-bit output (data output, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)

Functional Description:
The TopModule shall instantiate 8 D flip-flops (DFFs) that are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal. Each DFF shall have the following characteristics:
- Asynchronous Reset: The areset signal is active high, meaning when areset is high, all DFFs will reset.
- Reset State: Upon activation of the areset signal, all output bits of q shall be set to 0 (i.e., q = 8'b00000000).
- Data Input: On the positive edge of clk, each DFF shall capture the corresponding bit from the input d and hold it until the next positive edge of clk.

Timing and Behavior:
- The DFFs shall operate in a synchronous manner with respect to the clk signal, and the reset operation shall be independent of the clk.
- Ensure that the reset condition is prioritized over the data input during the active state of areset.

Edge Cases:
- When areset is asserted while clk is low, the output q should immediately reflect the reset state (0).
- When areset is deasserted, the DFFs will resume normal operation on the next positive edge of clk.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output q is directly dependent on the state of the input d at the last positive edge of clk, provided that areset is not asserted.
