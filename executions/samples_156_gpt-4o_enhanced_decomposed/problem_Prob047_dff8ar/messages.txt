        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (active high asynchronous reset signal)\n  - d: 8-bit input (data input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 8-bit output (data output, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule shall instantiate 8 D flip-flops (DFFs) that are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal. Each DFF shall have the following characteristics:\n- Asynchronous Reset: The areset signal is active high, meaning when areset is high, all DFFs will reset.\n- Reset State: Upon activation of the areset signal, all output bits of q shall be set to 0 (i.e., q = 8'b00000000).\n- Data Input: On the positive edge of clk, each DFF shall capture the corresponding bit from the input d and hold it until the next positive edge of clk.\n\nTiming and Behavior:\n- The DFFs shall operate in a synchronous manner with respect to the clk signal, and the reset operation shall be independent of the clk.\n- Ensure that the reset condition is prioritized over the data input during the active state of areset.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When areset is asserted while clk is low, the output q should immediately reflect the reset state (0).\n- When areset is deasserted, the DFFs will resume normal operation on the next positive edge of clk.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output q is directly dependent on the state of the input d at the last positive edge of clk, provided that areset is not asserted.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

The output should be reset to 0. All DFFs should be triggered by\nthe positive edge of clk.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
