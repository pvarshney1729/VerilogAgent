<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` that computes an even parity bit for an 8-bit input, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Interface Definition**: Define the module with an 8-bit input `in` and a 1-bit output `parity`.

2. **Parity Calculation**: The parity bit for even parity is calculated as the XOR of all the bits in the input. In Verilog, this can be done using the reduction XOR operator `^`.

3. **Combinational Logic**: Since the parity calculation is purely combinational, we will use an `assign` statement to directly compute the parity bit from the input.

4. **Coding Conventions**: Use `logic` for port declarations as per the guidelines. Since this is a simple combinational logic, we do not need any always block or sensitivity list.

5. **No Synchronous Reset**: The problem does not specify a need for a reset or clock, so we will not include any sequential logic or reset handling.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [7:0] in,  // 8-bit input
    output logic parity    // 1-bit output for parity
);

    // Compute even parity using reduction XOR
    assign parity = ^in;

endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>

);

    // Compute even parity using reduction XOR
    assign parity = ^in;
