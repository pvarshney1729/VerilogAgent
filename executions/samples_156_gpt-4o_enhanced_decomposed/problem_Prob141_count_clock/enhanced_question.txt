Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - ena: 1-bit input (enable signal for clock increment)

- Output Ports:
  - pm: 1-bit output (asserted high if the time is PM, low if AM)
  - hh: 8-bit output (hours in BCD format, range 01-12)
  - mm: 8-bit output (minutes in BCD format, range 00-59)
  - ss: 8-bit output (seconds in BCD format, range 00-59)

Functional Description:
The module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator. The clock is incremented based on the ena signal, which is pulsed once per second. The clk input operates at a frequency significantly higher than once per second.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is active high and synchronous. When asserted, it resets the clock to "12:00 AM" (hh = 8'b00001100, mm = 8'b00000000, ss = 8'b00000000).
- The reset signal takes precedence over the enable signal (ena) and can be asserted regardless of the state of ena.

Clocking:
- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Output Specifications:
- The pm output indicates whether the current time is in the PM period (1) or AM period (0).
- The hh, mm, and ss outputs represent the current time in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format, with the following ranges:
  - hh: 01 to 12 (BCD representation)
  - mm: 00 to 59 (BCD representation)
  - ss: 00 to 59 (BCD representation)

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the hh output rolls over from 12 to 1 after reaching 12 PM or AM.
- Ensure that the mm and ss outputs roll over from 59 to 00 after reaching 59.

Signal Dependencies:
- The pm output is derived from the hh output, indicating whether the hour is in the PM range (hh > 6).
- The counters for hh, mm, and ss must be synchronized to the ena signal, which dictates when the clock increments.

Initial Values:
- All registers should be initialized to their respective reset values upon reset assertion.
