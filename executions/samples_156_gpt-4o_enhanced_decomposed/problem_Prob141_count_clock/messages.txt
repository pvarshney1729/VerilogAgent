        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)\n  - ena: 1-bit input (enable signal for clock increment)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - pm: 1-bit output (asserted high if the time is PM, low if AM)\n  - hh: 8-bit output (hours in BCD format, range 01-12)\n  - mm: 8-bit output (minutes in BCD format, range 00-59)\n  - ss: 8-bit output (seconds in BCD format, range 00-59)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a 12-hour clock with an AM/PM indicator. The clock is incremented based on the ena signal, which is pulsed once per second. The clk input operates at a frequency significantly higher than once per second.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is active high and synchronous. When asserted, it resets the clock to \"12:00 AM\" (hh = 8'b00001100, mm = 8'b00000000, ss = 8'b00000000).\n- The reset signal takes precedence over the enable signal (ena) and can be asserted regardless of the state of ena.\n\nClocking:\n- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\nOutput Specifications:\n- The pm output indicates whether the current time is in the PM period (1) or AM period (0).\n- The hh, mm, and ss outputs represent the current time in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format, with the following ranges:\n  - hh: 01 to 12 (BCD representation)\n  - mm: 00 to 59 (BCD representation)\n  - ss: 00 to 59 (BCD representation)\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the hh output rolls over from 12 to 1 after reaching 12 PM or AM.\n- Ensure that the mm and ss outputs roll over from 59 to 00 after reaching 59.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The pm output is derived from the hh output, indicating whether the hour is in the PM range (hh > 6).\n- The counters for hh, mm, and ss must be synchronized to the ena signal, which dictates when the clock increments.\n\nInitial Values:\n- All registers should be initialized to their respective reset values upon reset assertion.\n                    "
