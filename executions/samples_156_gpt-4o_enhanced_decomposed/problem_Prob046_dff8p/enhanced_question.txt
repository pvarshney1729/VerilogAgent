Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock (active on the negative edge).
  - reset: 1-bit input signal for synchronous reset (active high).
  - d: 8-bit input data signal (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).

- Output Ports:
  - q: 8-bit output data signal (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).

Functional Description:
- The module shall instantiate 8 D flip-flops (DFFs) that are triggered on the negative edge of the clk signal.
- Each DFF shall have an active high synchronous reset input (reset).
- Upon activation of the reset signal, all DFFs shall be set to the value 0x34 (binary: 0011 0100).
- When the reset signal is not active, the DFFs shall capture the value present on the d input at the negative edge of clk.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous, meaning that the reset state of the DFFs will only take effect in relation to the clk signal.

Initial Values:
- All DFFs shall be initialized to 0x34 when the reset signal is asserted.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the DFFs do not change state during the reset condition, and only transition to the value of d on the negative edge of clk when reset is not asserted.
