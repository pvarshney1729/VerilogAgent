<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` with the specified interface and behavior, we need to create a module that includes 8 D flip-flops. Each flip-flop will store one bit of the 8-bit input `d` and output it to the 8-bit output `q`. The flip-flops should be triggered on the negative edge of the clock (`clk`) and have an active high synchronous reset. When reset is active, the flip-flops should be set to the value `0x34` (which is `8'b00110100` in binary).

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always_ff` block to describe the behavior of the D flip-flops. The block is sensitive to the negative edge of `clk`.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Inside the `always_ff` block, check if `reset` is high. If it is, set the output `q` to `8'b00110100`. Otherwise, assign the input `d` to `q`.

4. **Initialization**: Although initialization is not typically synthesized, it is useful for simulation. Initialize `q` to zero at the start of the simulation.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the guidelines and conventions provided, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring the reset is synchronous.

            q <= d; // Capture input d
        end
