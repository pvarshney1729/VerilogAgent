Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic a;  // 1-bit input
  - input logic b;  // 1-bit input
  - input logic c;  // 1-bit input
  - input logic d;  // 1-bit input
- Output Port:
  - output logic q; // 1-bit output

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following truth table derived from the provided simulation waveforms. The output 'q' is determined by the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' at any given time.

Truth Table:
| Time (ns) | a | b | c | d | q |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 5         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 10        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 15        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 20        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 25        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 30        | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 35        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 40        | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 45        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 50        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 55        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 60        | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 65        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 70        | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 75        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 80        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 85        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 90        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Implementation Notes:
- The module is purely combinational; therefore, the output 'q' should be updated immediately based on the current values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
- Ensure that the logic for determining 'q' is derived from the truth table provided above.
- There are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved in this design.
- There are no resets or initial values required for this combinational logic module.

Edge Cases:
- The output 'q' must be defined for all combinations of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' as shown in the truth table.
- Ensure that the output is stable and reflects the correct value based on the input combinations at all times.
