Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input logic in1;  // 1-bit input signal\n  - input logic in2;  // 1-bit input signal\n  - input logic in3;  // 1-bit input signal\n- Output Ports:\n  - output logic out;  // 1-bit output signal\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic circuit consisting of the following components:\n1. A two-input XNOR gate that takes 'in1' and 'in2' as inputs. The output of this gate will be referred to as 'xnor_out'.\n2. A two-input XOR gate that takes 'xnor_out' and 'in3' as inputs. The output of this gate is assigned to the output port 'out'.\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- 'xnor_out' is an intermediate signal that represents the output of the XNOR operation between 'in1' and 'in2'.\n\nBehavioral Description:\n- The output 'out' is computed as follows:\n  out = (in1 XNOR in2) XOR in3\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module does not have any specific edge cases or input boundaries to handle, as all inputs are single-bit signals.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic without any sequential elements.\n\nTiming:\n- The module operates under combinational logic principles, with no clock cycles or sequential dependencies involved.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

The output of the\nXOR is 'out'.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
