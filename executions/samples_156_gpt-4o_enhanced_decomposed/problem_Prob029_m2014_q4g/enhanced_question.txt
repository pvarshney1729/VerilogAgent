<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic in1;  // 1-bit input signal
  - input logic in2;  // 1-bit input signal
  - input logic in3;  // 1-bit input signal
- Output Ports:
  - output logic out;  // 1-bit output signal

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit consisting of the following components:
1. A two-input XNOR gate that takes 'in1' and 'in2' as inputs. The output of this gate will be referred to as 'xnor_out'.
2. A two-input XOR gate that takes 'xnor_out' and 'in3' as inputs. The output of this gate is assigned to the output port 'out'.

Signal Definitions:
- 'xnor_out' is an intermediate signal that represents the output of the XNOR operation between 'in1' and 'in2'.

Behavioral Description:
- The output 'out' is computed as follows:
  out = (in1 XNOR in2) XOR in3

Edge Cases:
- The module does not have any specific edge cases or input boundaries to handle, as all inputs are single-bit signals.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational logic without any sequential elements.

Timing:
- The module operates under combinational logic principles, with no clock cycles or sequential dependencies involved.
