<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to follow the specified logic circuit. The circuit consists of a two-input XNOR gate followed by a two-input XOR gate. The XNOR gate takes `in1` and `in2` as inputs, and its output is connected to one of the inputs of the XOR gate. The other input of the XOR gate is `in3`. The output of the XOR gate is the module's output `out`.

1. **XNOR Gate**: The XNOR operation is the logical negation of the XOR operation. For two inputs `A` and `B`, the XNOR operation can be expressed as `~(A ^ B)`.

2. **XOR Gate**: The XOR operation for two inputs `A` and `B` is expressed as `A ^ B`.

3. **Combining the Gates**: The output of the XNOR gate is used as one of the inputs to the XOR gate, with `in3` as the other input.

4. **Verilog Implementation**: We will use an `assign` statement for combinational logic, as it is straightforward and efficient for this purpose. We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

    // XNOR operation
    assign xnor_out = ~(in1 ^ in2);

    // XOR operation
    assign out = xnor_out ^ in3;
