<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that can correctly identify and process a serial data stream consisting of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. The FSM will have the following states:

1. **IDLE**: The FSM waits for a start bit (logic 0) to begin receiving a byte.
2. **RECEIVE**: The FSM receives the 8 data bits, one bit per clock cycle.
3. **STOP**: The FSM checks for the stop bit (logic 1) after receiving the data bits.
4. **DONE**: The FSM asserts the `done` signal and outputs the received byte.

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input bit and the current state. The `reset` signal is used to initialize the FSM to the IDLE state. The `out_byte` is updated during the RECEIVE state, and the `done` signal is asserted in the DONE state.
