Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - in: 1-bit input (serial data input)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out_byte: 8-bit output (data byte received, valid when done is high)
  - done: 1-bit output (indicates that a complete byte has been received)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process a serial communication protocol that transmits data bytes with a specific format. The expected format consists of:
- 1 start bit (logic 0)
- 8 data bits (LSB first)
- 1 stop bit (logic 1)

The FSM will operate as follows:
1. The FSM will continuously monitor the input stream for the start bit (0).
2. Upon detecting the start bit, the FSM will transition to a state where it will receive the subsequent 8 data bits.
3. The FSM will then verify the presence of the stop bit (1) after the data bits.
4. If the stop bit is correctly received, the FSM will assert the `done` signal high, indicating that `out_byte` contains valid data.
5. If the stop bit is not received when expected, the FSM will remain in the current state until a stop bit is detected, at which point it will prepare to receive the next byte.

Reset Behavior:
- The module includes an active-high synchronous reset. When the reset signal is asserted, all internal registers and state variables will be initialized to their default states:
  - The FSM will reset to the idle state.
  - The `out_byte` will be set to 8'b00000000.
  - The `done` signal will be deasserted (logic 0).

Timing and Edge Cases:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The `out_byte` output will only be valid when the `done` signal is high. In all other cases, the value of `out_byte` is considered don't-care.
- The module must handle cases where the input stream may contain noise or invalid sequences, ensuring that it only transitions to the valid states as defined.

Bit Indexing:
- The `out_byte` output is indexed as follows: `out_byte[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and `out_byte[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

Signal Dependencies:
- The FSM must ensure that the detection of the start bit, data bits, and stop bit occurs in the correct sequence to avoid race conditions and ensure reliable operation.
