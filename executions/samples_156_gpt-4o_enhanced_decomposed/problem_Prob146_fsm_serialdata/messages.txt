        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)\n  - in: 1-bit input (serial data input)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - out_byte: 8-bit output (data byte received, valid when done is high)\n  - done: 1-bit output (indicates that a complete byte has been received)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process a serial communication protocol that transmits data bytes with a specific format. The expected format consists of:\n- 1 start bit (logic 0)\n- 8 data bits (LSB first)\n- 1 stop bit (logic 1)\n\nThe FSM will operate as follows:\n1. The FSM will continuously monitor the input stream for the start bit (0).\n2. Upon detecting the start bit, the FSM will transition to a state where it will receive the subsequent 8 data bits.\n3. The FSM will then verify the presence of the stop bit (1) after the data bits.\n4. If the stop bit is correctly received, the FSM will assert the `done` signal high, indicating that `out_byte` contains valid data.\n5. If the stop bit is not received when expected, the FSM will remain in the current state until a stop bit is detected, at which point it will prepare to receive the next byte.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module includes an active-high synchronous reset. When the reset signal is asserted, all internal registers and state variables will be initialized to their default states:\n  - The FSM will reset to the idle state.\n  - The `out_byte` will be set to 8'b00000000.\n  - The `done` signal will be deasserted (logic 0).\n\nTiming and Edge Cases:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.\n- The `out_byte` output will only be valid when the `done` signal is high. In all other cases, the value of `out_byte` is considered don't-care.\n- The module must handle cases where the input stream may contain noise or invalid sequences, ensuring that it only transitions to the valid states as defined.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- The `out_byte` output is indexed as follows: `out_byte[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and `out_byte[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The FSM must ensure that the detection of the start bit, data bits, and stop bit occurs in the correct sequence to avoid race conditions and ensure reliable operation.\n                    "
