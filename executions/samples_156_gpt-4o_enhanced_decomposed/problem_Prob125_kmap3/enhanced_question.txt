Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: 1-bit input representing the first variable.
  - input wire b: 1-bit input representing the second variable.
  - input wire c: 1-bit input representing the third variable.
  - input wire d: 1-bit input representing the fourth variable (don't-care condition).
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: 1-bit output representing the result of the logic function.

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic function based on the provided Karnaugh map. The output 'out' is determined by the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' as follows:

Karnaugh Map:
              ab
   cd   01  00  10  11
   00 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   01 | 0 | 0 | d | d |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Where:
- 'd' indicates a don't-care condition, allowing for flexibility in output assignment.
- The output 'out' should be defined for all combinations of inputs, with the following mappings:
  - For cd = 00: out = 0 (if d = 0), out = 1 (if d = 1)
  - For cd = 01: out = 0
  - For cd = 10: out = 1
  - For cd = 11: out = 1

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the output 'out' is defined for all possible combinations of inputs.
- The module should not have any sequential logic; it is purely combinational.
- There are no resets or clock cycles involved in this module.
- The implementation should handle all edge cases and input boundaries as specified in the Karnaugh map.
