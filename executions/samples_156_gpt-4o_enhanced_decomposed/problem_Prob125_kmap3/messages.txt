Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a: 1-bit input representing the first variable.\n  - input wire b: 1-bit input representing the second variable.\n  - input wire c: 1-bit input representing the third variable.\n  - input wire d: 1-bit input representing the fourth variable (don't-care condition).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out: 1-bit output representing the result of the logic function.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a combinational logic function based on the provided Karnaugh map. The output 'out' is determined by the values of inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' as follows:\n\nKarnaugh Map:\n              ab\n   cd   01  00  10  11\n   00 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n   01 | 0 | 0 | d | d |\n   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n   10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nWhere:\n- 'd' indicates a don't-care condition, allowing for flexibility in output assignment.\n- The output 'out' should be defined for all combinations of inputs, with the following mappings:\n  - For cd = 00: out = 0 (if d = 0), out = 1 (if d = 1)\n  - For cd = 01: out = 0\n  - For cd = 10: out = 1\n  - For cd = 11: out = 1\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that the output 'out' is defined for all possible combinations of inputs.\n- The module should not have any sequential logic; it is purely combinational.\n- There are no resets or clock cycles involved in this module.\n- The implementation should handle all edge cases and input boundaries as specified in the Karnaugh map.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
