Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - in: 32-bit input vector (in[31:0], where in[0] is the least significant bit)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 32-bit output vector (out[31:0], where out[0] is the least significant bit)

Functional Description:
The TopModule shall monitor each bit of the 32-bit input vector 'in'. The module will detect a transition of any bit from '1' to '0' within a single clock cycle. Upon detecting such a transition, the corresponding bit in the output vector 'out' will be set to '1' and will remain '1' until the reset signal is activated.

Behavioral Specifications:
- The output 'out' will be updated on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).
- The reset signal (reset) is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted, all bits of the output vector 'out' will be set to '0'.
- The output will only change to '1' when a '1' to '0' transition is detected in the input vector 'in' during a clock cycle.

Edge Cases:
- If the input vector 'in' does not change, the output vector 'out' will remain unchanged.
- If multiple bits in 'in' transition from '1' to '0' in the same clock cycle, the corresponding bits in 'out' will be set to '1' for each detected transition.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, all bits of the output vector 'out' shall be initialized to '0' (out[31:0] = 32'b0).
