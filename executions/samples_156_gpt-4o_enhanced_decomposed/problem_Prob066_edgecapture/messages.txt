        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)\n  - in: 32-bit input vector (in[31:0], where in[0] is the least significant bit)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 32-bit output vector (out[31:0], where out[0] is the least significant bit)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule shall monitor each bit of the 32-bit input vector 'in'. The module will detect a transition of any bit from '1' to '0' within a single clock cycle. Upon detecting such a transition, the corresponding bit in the output vector 'out' will be set to '1' and will remain '1' until the reset signal is activated.\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The output 'out' will be updated on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk).\n- The reset signal (reset) is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted, all bits of the output vector 'out' will be set to '0'.\n- The output will only change to '1' when a '1' to '0' transition is detected in the input vector 'in' during a clock cycle.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If the input vector 'in' does not change, the output vector 'out' will remain unchanged.\n- If multiple bits in 'in' transition from '1' to '0' in the same clock cycle, the corresponding bits in 'out' will be set to '1' for each detected transition.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, all bits of the output vector 'out' shall be initialized to '0' (out[31:0] = 32'b0).\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
