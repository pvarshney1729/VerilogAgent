<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to detect when a bit in the 32-bit input vector `in` changes from 1 to 0 on consecutive clock cycles. When such a transition is detected, the corresponding bit in the 32-bit output vector `out` should be set to 1 and remain 1 until a reset occurs.

1. **Input and Output Ports**: The module has a 32-bit input `in` and a 32-bit output `out`. It also has a clock `clk` and a synchronous reset `reset`.

2. **State Storage**: We need to store the previous state of the input vector to detect transitions. This requires a 32-bit register `prev_in`.

3. **Transition Detection**: For each bit, we need to check if it was 1 in the previous cycle and is 0 in the current cycle. This can be done using the expression `prev_in[i] & ~in[i]`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output should be set to 1 for any bit where a 1-to-0 transition is detected. This is achieved by OR-ing the current output with the detected transition.

5. **Synchronous Reset**: The output should be reset to 0 when the reset signal is high. This is handled within the clocked always block.

6. **Initialization**: Initialize `prev_in` and `out` to zero for simulation purposes.
