<REASONING>
To implement the state machine using one-hot encoding, we need to derive the next-state logic for the given state transitions. The states are encoded as follows:

- A: y[5:0] = 000001
- B: y[5:0] = 000010
- C: y[5:0] = 000100
- D: y[5:0] = 001000
- E: y[5:0] = 010000
- F: y[5:0] = 100000

The transitions are based on the input `w`. We need to derive the logic for the next states Y2 and Y4, which correspond to y[1] and y[3] respectively.

From the state diagram:
- Y2 (next state B) is active when:
  - Current state A and w = 0
  - Current state F and w = 0

- Y4 (next state D) is active when:
  - Current state B and w = 1
  - Current state C and w = 1
  - Current state F and w = 1

The outputs Y1 and Y3 are derived from the states:
- Y1 is active when in state E (y[4] = 1)
- Y3 is active when in state D (y[3] = 1)

We will implement this logic in a Verilog module with synchronous reset.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [5:0] y,
    input logic w,
    output logic Y1,
    output logic Y3,
    output logic Y2,
    output logic Y4
);

    // Output logic
    assign Y1 = y[4]; // Active in state E
    assign Y3 = y[3]; // Active in state D

    // Next state logic
    assign Y2 = (y[0] & ~w) | (y[5] & ~w); // Next state B
    assign Y4 = (y[1] & w) | (y[2] & w) | (y[5] & w); // Next state D

endmodule
[DONE]
