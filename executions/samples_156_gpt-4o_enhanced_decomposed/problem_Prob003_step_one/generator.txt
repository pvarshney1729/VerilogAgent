<REASONING>
The task is to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` that has a single output port named `one`. This output should always be driven to logic high (1). Since there are no inputs or conditions affecting the output, the simplest way to achieve this is by using an `assign` statement to continuously drive the output to 1. This approach is straightforward and efficient for a constant output.

Given the guidelines and coding conventions, we will:
- Declare the output port using `logic` as per the convention.
- Use an `assign` statement to drive the output to 1, as there is no need for an `always` block since no input signals are read.
- Ensure the numeric constant is properly sized, using `1'b1` to represent a single bit with a value of 1.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic one
);
    // Drive the output 'one' to logic high
    assign one = 1'b1;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
