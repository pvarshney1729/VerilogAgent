Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Port:
  - Name: one
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Type: Logic (drives high)
  - Description: This output port will continuously drive a logic high (1) state.

Functional Description:
- The module is combinational in nature, with no internal state or sequential logic.
- The output 'one' will always be set to logic high (1) regardless of any input signals.

Behavior:
- The output 'one' will remain at logic high (1) at all times during operation.
- There are no edge cases or input boundaries to consider, as there are no input ports defined for this module.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no reset conditions applicable to this module, as it does not contain any registers or sequential elements.

Initial State:
- The output 'one' is initialized to logic high (1) upon module instantiation.
