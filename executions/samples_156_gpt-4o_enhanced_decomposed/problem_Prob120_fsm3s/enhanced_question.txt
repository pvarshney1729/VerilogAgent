Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - reset: 1-bit input (synchronous active high reset signal)
  - in: 1-bit input (input signal for state transitions)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (output signal based on the current state)

State Machine Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
- States: The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D.
- State Transition Table:
  
  | Current State | Input (in=0) | Next State (in=0) | Next State (in=1) | Output |
  |---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
  | A             | 0             | A                  | B                  | 0      |
  | B             | 0             | C                  | B                  | 0      |
  | C             | 0             | A                  | D                  | 0      |
  | D             | 0             | C                  | B                  | 1      |

Reset Behavior:
- The state machine resets to state A when the reset signal is asserted (active high).
- All flip-flops and registers should be initialized to their respective states upon reset.

Clocking:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Signal Definitions:
- The output signal 'out' reflects the current state of the state machine, specifically outputting '1' only when in state D, and '0' in all other states.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state machine behaves correctly for all possible input combinations, particularly during transitions between states and when the reset signal is asserted.
