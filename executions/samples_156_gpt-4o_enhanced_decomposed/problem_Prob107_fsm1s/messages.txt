        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)\n  - in: 1-bit input (data signal)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 1-bit output (data signal)\n\nState Machine Description:\nThis module implements a Moore state machine with two states: State A and State B. The state transitions are defined based on the input signal 'in' and the output signal 'out' is determined by the current state.\n\nStates:\n- State B (reset state):\n  - Output: out = 1\n  - Transitions:\n    - If in = 0, transition to State A\n    - If in = 1, remain in State B\n\n- State A:\n  - Output: out = 0\n  - Transitions:\n    - If in = 0, transition to State B\n    - If in = 1, remain in State A\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous. Upon the assertion of the reset signal (reset = 1), the state machine will transition to State B, and the output 'out' will be set to 1.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All flip-flops and registers should be initialized to a defined state upon reset.\n\nTiming:\n- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the state machine behaves correctly for all possible input combinations, particularly during the reset condition and when transitioning between states.\n                    "
