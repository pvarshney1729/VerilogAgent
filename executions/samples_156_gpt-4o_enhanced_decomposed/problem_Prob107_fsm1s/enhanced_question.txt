Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)
  - in: 1-bit input (data signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (data signal)

State Machine Description:
This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: State A and State B. The state transitions are defined based on the input signal 'in' and the output signal 'out' is determined by the current state.

States:
- State B (reset state):
  - Output: out = 1
  - Transitions:
    - If in = 0, transition to State A
    - If in = 1, remain in State B

- State A:
  - Output: out = 0
  - Transitions:
    - If in = 0, transition to State B
    - If in = 1, remain in State A

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous. Upon the assertion of the reset signal (reset = 1), the state machine will transition to State B, and the output 'out' will be set to 1.

Initial Conditions:
- All flip-flops and registers should be initialized to a defined state upon reset.

Timing:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state machine behaves correctly for all possible input combinations, particularly during the reset condition and when transitioning between states.
