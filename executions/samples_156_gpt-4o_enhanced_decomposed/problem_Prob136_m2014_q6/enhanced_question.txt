Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high, asynchronous reset)
  - w: 1-bit input (data input)

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output (state output)

State Machine Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states and transitions:

States:
- A (State 0)
- B (State 1)
- C (State 2)
- D (State 3)
- E (State 4)
- F (State 5)

State Transition Table:
- From State A (0):
  - On input w = 0: Transition to State B (1)
  - On input w = 1: Remain in State A (0)

- From State B (1):
  - On input w = 0: Transition to State C (2)
  - On input w = 1: Transition to State D (3)

- From State C (2):
  - On input w = 0: Transition to State E (4)
  - On input w = 1: Transition to State D (3)

- From State D (3):
  - On input w = 0: Transition to State F (5)
  - On input w = 1: Transition to State A (0)

- From State E (4):
  - On input w = 0: Remain in State E (4)
  - On input w = 1: Transition to State D (3)

- From State F (5):
  - On input w = 0: Transition to State C (2)
  - On input w = 1: Transition to State D (3)

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal (reset) is asynchronous and active high. When asserted, the FSM should transition to State A (0) regardless of the current state or input.

Initial State:
- Upon reset, the FSM will initialize to State A (0).

Clocking:
- All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Output Specification:
- The output z should reflect the current state of the FSM, where:
  - z = 1 when in State E (4)
  - z = 0 for all other states (A, B, C, D, F)
