<REASONING>
To implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer, we need to select between two inputs, `a` and `b`, based on the value of the `sel` signal. The output `out` should be equal to `a` when `sel` is 0, and equal to `b` when `sel` is 1. This can be achieved using a simple conditional expression or a case statement. Since this is purely combinational logic, we will use an `always @(*)` block to describe the behavior. We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions, and we will not use any sequential logic or reset signals since they are not required for this task.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic sel,
    output logic out
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (sel == 1'b0) begin
            out = a;
        end else begin
            out = b;
        end
    end
