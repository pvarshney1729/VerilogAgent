Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a;  // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire b;  // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire sel; // 1-bit select signal

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out; // 1-bit output signal

Functionality:
The TopModule implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer with the following behavior:
- When sel = 1'b0 (select signal is low), the output out will be assigned the value of input a.
- When sel = 1'b1 (select signal is high), the output out will be assigned the value of input b.

Signal Definitions:
- All input and output ports are defined as 1-bit wide.
- The least significant bit (LSB) is indexed as bit[0].

Behavioral Description:
- The output out is combinationally dependent on the inputs a, b, and sel.
- There are no sequential elements or clock cycles involved in this module.
- The module does not require any reset conditions as it is purely combinational logic.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible input combinations for a, b, and sel without any undefined behavior.
