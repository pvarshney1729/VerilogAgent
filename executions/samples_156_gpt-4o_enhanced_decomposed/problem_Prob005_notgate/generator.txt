The task is to implement a simple NOT gate using a Verilog module named `TopModule`. The NOT gate inverts the input signal, meaning if the input is `1`, the output should be `0`, and vice versa. The module has one input port named `in` and one output port named `out`, both of which are one bit wide. Since this is a combinational logic operation, we will use an `assign` statement to directly assign the inverted value of the input to the output. This approach is efficient and straightforward for implementing simple combinational logic like a NOT gate.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing NOT gate
    assign out = ~in;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
