Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned, representing the signal to be inverted)
  
- Output Ports:
  - out: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned, representing the inverted signal)

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic NOT gate. The output 'out' is the logical negation of the input 'in'.
  
Behavior:
- The output 'out' shall be updated immediately based on the input 'in' without any delay.
- The relationship is defined as: out = ~in (where ~ denotes the bitwise NOT operation).

Edge Cases:
- When 'in' is 0 (logic low), 'out' shall be 1 (logic high).
- When 'in' is 1 (logic high), 'out' shall be 0 (logic low).

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this module as it is purely combinational logic.
