<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a module that acts as a single stage in an n-bit shift register. The module should handle loading a value, shifting, and maintaining the current state based on the control signals provided.

1. **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has five inputs (`clk`, `w`, `R`, `E`, `L`) and one output (`Q`). All are 1-bit signals.

2. **Functionality**:
   - **Load Operation**: When `L` is asserted, the module should load the value of `R` into the output `Q`.
   - **Shift Operation**: When `E` is asserted and `L` is not, the module should shift the value from the previous stage (`w`) into `Q`.
   - **Hold Operation**: If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the module should hold the current value of `Q`.

3. **Clock Edge**: The operations are triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).

4. **Synchronous Logic**: The logic is synchronous, meaning all operations are controlled by the clock signal.

5. **Implementation**: Use an `always_ff` block to describe the sequential logic, which is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The logic inside the block will check the control signals `L` and `E` to determine the next state of `Q`.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic w,
    input logic R,
    input logic E,
    input logic L,
    output logic Q
);

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (L) begin
            Q <= R;  // Load operation
        end else if (E) begin
            Q <= w;  // Shift operation
        end
        // If neither L nor E is asserted, Q holds its value
    end

endmodule
