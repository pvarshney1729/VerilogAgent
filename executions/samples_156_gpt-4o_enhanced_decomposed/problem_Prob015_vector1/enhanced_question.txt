Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - in: bit[15:0] (16 bits) - Represents a 16-bit half-word input. 
    - bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
    - bit[15] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - out_hi: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - Represents the upper byte of the input half-word, corresponding to bits [15:8] of 'in'.
  - out_lo: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - Represents the lower byte of the input half-word, corresponding to bits [7:0] of 'in'.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit that splits the 16-bit input 'in' into two separate 8-bit outputs:
  - 'out_hi' will output the upper byte (bits [15:8] of 'in').
  - 'out_lo' will output the lower byte (bits [7:0] of 'in').

Behavioral Specifications:
- The outputs 'out_hi' and 'out_lo' are updated simultaneously based on the value of 'in' without any clock dependency, ensuring that the outputs reflect the input immediately upon any change in 'in'.
- There are no edge cases or input boundaries specified that would affect the output behavior, as the operation is straightforward bit slicing.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified for this combinational module, as it does not contain any state-holding elements.

Signal Dependencies:
- The outputs 'out_hi' and 'out_lo' are directly dependent on the input 'in' with no additional logic or conditions affecting their values.
