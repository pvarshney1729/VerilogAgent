Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port:\n  - in: bit[15:0] (16 bits) - Represents a 16-bit half-word input. \n    - bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n    - bit[15] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out_hi: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - Represents the upper byte of the input half-word, corresponding to bits [15:8] of 'in'.\n  - out_lo: bit[7:0] (8 bits) - Represents the lower byte of the input half-word, corresponding to bits [7:0] of 'in'.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a combinational logic circuit that splits the 16-bit input 'in' into two separate 8-bit outputs:\n  - 'out_hi' will output the upper byte (bits [15:8] of 'in').\n  - 'out_lo' will output the lower byte (bits [7:0] of 'in').\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The outputs 'out_hi' and 'out_lo' are updated simultaneously based on the value of 'in' without any clock dependency, ensuring that the outputs reflect the input immediately upon any change in 'in'.\n- There are no edge cases or input boundaries specified that would affect the output behavior, as the operation is straightforward bit slicing.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- No reset conditions are specified for this combinational module, as it does not contain any state-holding elements.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The outputs 'out_hi' and 'out_lo' are directly dependent on the input 'in' with no additional logic or conditions affecting their values.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in     (16 bits)\n - output out_hi ( 8 bits)\n - output out_lo ( 8 bits)\n\nThe module should implement a combinational circuit that splits an input\nhalf-word (16 bits, [15:0] ) into lower [7:0] and upper [15:8] bytes.\n</Original Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
