Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - in: 8-bit input (input byte stream)

- Output Ports:
  - out_bytes: 24-bit output (contains the received message bytes)
    - out_bytes[23:16]: First byte of the message
    - out_bytes[15:8]: Second byte of the message
    - out_bytes[7:0]: Third byte of the message
  - done: 1-bit output (indicates the successful receipt of a complete message)

Functional Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) that processes an incoming byte stream to identify message boundaries. The FSM operates as follows:
1. Discard incoming bytes until the condition in[3] = 1 is met, indicating the start of a message.
2. Upon detecting the first byte of a message, the FSM will continue to receive the next two bytes.
3. The FSM asserts the done signal in the clock cycle immediately following the successful receipt of the third byte of the message.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), all internal registers and state variables should be initialized to a defined state:
  - out_bytes should be set to 24'b0 (zero).
  - done should be set to 0 (inactive).

Output Validity:
- The out_bytes output must be valid and reflect the received message whenever the done signal is asserted. At all other times, the output can be considered don't-care.

Clocking:
- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Edge Case Handling:
- The FSM should handle cases where no valid message is received by maintaining the out_bytes output as zero and keeping the done signal deasserted until a valid message is detected.

Example Waveform:
- The example waveform provided illustrates the timing relationship between the clk, reset, in, done, and out_bytes signals during operation. The timing of these signals should be consistent with the described behavior of the FSM.

Note: Ensure that all signal dependencies and potential race conditions are carefully managed to maintain correct operation of the FSM.
