        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input signal representing the clock. The clock signal is assumed to be active on both the rising and falling edges.\n  - d: 1-bit input signal representing the data input.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 1-bit output signal representing the output of the flip-flop.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a dual-edge triggered flip-flop behavior. Since dual-edge triggered flip-flops are not natively supported in FPGAs, the design must simulate this functionality using combinational and sequential logic.\n\nBehavioral Specifications:\n- The output 'q' should capture the value of the input 'd' on both the rising edge (posedge) and falling edge (negedge) of the clock signal 'clk'.\n- The output 'q' should maintain its value until the next triggering edge of the clock.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There is no explicit reset signal defined in this specification. The initial state of the output 'q' is undefined until the first clock edge occurs.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The module should ensure that the output 'q' does not change during the clock period between edges, maintaining the last captured value until the next edge occurs.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'q' is dependent on the input 'd' and the clock signal 'clk'. The implementation must ensure that there are no race conditions between the clock edges and the data input.\n\nImplementation Note:\n- The design must avoid using an always block with both posedge and negedge in the sensitivity list, as this is not synthesizable in FPGA environments.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
