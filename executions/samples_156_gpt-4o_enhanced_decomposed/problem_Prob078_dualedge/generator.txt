<REASONING>
To implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard FPGA resources, we can use two single-edge triggered flip-flops. One flip-flop will capture the data on the rising edge of the clock, and the other will capture the data on the falling edge. We will then use a multiplexer to select between the outputs of these two flip-flops based on the clock signal. This way, we can mimic the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

1. **Clock Division**: Use the clock signal to control which flip-flop's output is selected. This can be done by using the clock signal itself as the select line for a multiplexer.

2. **Rising Edge Flip-Flop**: Capture the input data on the rising edge of the clock.

3. **Falling Edge Flip-Flop**: Capture the input data on the falling edge of the clock.

4. **Multiplexer**: Use the clock signal to select between the outputs of the two flip-flops. When the clock is high, select the output of the falling edge flip-flop, and when the clock is low, select the output of the rising edge flip-flop.

5. **Output**: The output of the multiplexer will be the output of the dual-edge triggered flip-flop.
