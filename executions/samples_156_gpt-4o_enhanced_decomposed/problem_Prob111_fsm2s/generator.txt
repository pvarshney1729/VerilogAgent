<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as described, we need to define two states: OFF and ON. The state transitions are based on the inputs `j` and `k`, and the output is determined by the current state. The reset is a synchronous active-high reset that sets the state to OFF.

1. **State Encoding**: We can use a single bit to represent the two states:
   - OFF: 0
   - ON: 1

2. **State Transition Logic**:
   - From OFF (state = 0):
     - If `j` is 0, stay in OFF.
     - If `j` is 1, transition to ON.
   - From ON (state = 1):
     - If `k` is 0, stay in ON.
     - If `k` is 1, transition to OFF.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The output `out` is 0 when in state OFF and 1 when in state ON.

4. **Synchronous Reset**:
   - When `reset` is high, the state is set to OFF on the next clock edge.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock to handle state transitions and synchronous reset.
   - Use a separate always block or continuous assignment for the output logic based on the current state.
