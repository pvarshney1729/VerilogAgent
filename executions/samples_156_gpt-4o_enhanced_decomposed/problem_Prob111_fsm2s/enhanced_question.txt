Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active-high synchronous reset)
  - j: 1-bit input (state transition control)
  - k: 1-bit input (state transition control)

- Output Ports:
  - out: 1-bit output (current state indication)

State Machine Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
- States: 
  - OFF (output out = 0)
  - ON (output out = 1)

- State Transition Conditions:
  - From OFF to OFF: 
    - Condition: j = 0
  - From OFF to ON: 
    - Condition: j = 1
  - From ON to ON: 
    - Condition: k = 0
  - From ON to OFF: 
    - Condition: k = 1

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is active-high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), the state machine transitions to the OFF state, and the output out is set to 0.

Clock Cycle Relationships:
- The state transitions occur on the rising edge of the clk signal.

Initial State:
- Upon reset, the state machine initializes to the OFF state (out = 0).

Signal Dependencies:
- The output out is determined solely by the current state of the state machine, which is influenced by the inputs j and k during the clock cycle.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the state machine handles transitions correctly when inputs j and k change simultaneously at the clock edge.
