Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: 1-bit input signal (active high)
  - state: 4-bit input signal representing the current state, where:
    - state[0] corresponds to state A (4'b0001)
    - state[1] corresponds to state B (4'b0010)
    - state[2] corresponds to state C (4'b0100)
    - state[3] corresponds to state D (4'b1000)

- Output Ports:
  - next_state: 4-bit output signal representing the next state, encoded in one-hot format
  - out: 1-bit output signal (active high)

Functional Description:
The module implements a Moore state machine with the following characteristics:
- The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D, represented using one-hot encoding.
- The state transition and output logic are defined by the following state transition table:

  | Current State | Input (in) | Next State | Output |
  |---------------|------------|-------------|--------|
  | A             | 0          | A           | 0      |
  | A             | 1          | B           | 0      |
  | B             | 0          | C           | 0      |
  | B             | 1          | B           | 0      |
  | C             | 0          | A           | 0      |
  | C             | 1          | D           | 0      |
  | D             | 0          | C           | 0      |
  | D             | 1          | B           | 1      |

Implementation Notes:
- The module should only implement the combinational logic for state transitions and output generation based on the current state and input.
- Ensure that the output signal 'out' is determined solely by the current state and does not depend on the input signal 'in' for states A, B, and C.
- The next_state output should be a valid one-hot representation of the next state based on the current state and input conditions.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle all possible input combinations for the current state and input signal without undefined behavior.
- Ensure that the output remains stable during transitions between states.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are specified in this module; the initial state is assumed to be defined externally.
