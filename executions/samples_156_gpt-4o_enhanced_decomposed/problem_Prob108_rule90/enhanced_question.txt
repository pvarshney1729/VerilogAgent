Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge triggered)
  - load: 1-bit input (load signal to initialize the state)
  - data: 512-bit input (initial state of the cellular automaton, data[511:0])

- Output Ports:
  - q: 512-bit output (current state of the cellular automaton, q[511:0])

Functional Description:
The module implements Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton with the following characteristics:

1. The cellular automaton consists of an array of 512 cells, indexed from q[0] to q[511].
2. Each cell can be in one of two states: on (1) or off (0).
3. The next state of each cell (q[n] for n = 0 to 511) is determined by the XOR operation of its two immediate neighbors:
   - Left (q[n-1]) | Center (q[n]) | Right (q[n+1]) | Center's next state (q[n] next)
   - 1                | 1                | 1                | 0
   - 1                | 1                | 0                | 1
   - 1                | 0                | 1                | 0
   - 1                | 0                | 0                | 1
   - 0                | 1                | 1                | 1
   - 0                | 1                | 0                | 0
   - 0                | 0                | 1                | 1
   - 0                | 0                | 0                | 0

4. The boundaries of the cellular automaton are defined as:
   - q[-1] = 0 (off)
   - q[512] = 0 (off)

Operational Behavior:
- On the positive edge of the clk signal:
  - If load is asserted (load = 1), the state of the cellular automaton is initialized with the value from data[511:0].
  - If load is not asserted (load = 0), the next state of each cell is computed based on the current states of its neighbors according to Rule 90.

Reset Behavior:
- There is no explicit reset signal defined; however, the initial state can be loaded using the load signal.

Timing:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The state of the output q is updated every clock cycle based on the current state and the load signal.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the behavior of the module is well-defined for all possible input combinations, particularly when the load signal is toggled during operation.
