        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge triggered)\n  - load: 1-bit input (load signal to initialize the state)\n  - data: 512-bit input (initial state of the cellular automaton, data[511:0])\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 512-bit output (current state of the cellular automaton, q[511:0])\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton with the following characteristics:\n\n1. The cellular automaton consists of an array of 512 cells, indexed from q[0] to q[511].\n2. Each cell can be in one of two states: on (1) or off (0).\n3. The next state of each cell (q[n] for n = 0 to 511) is determined by the XOR operation of its two immediate neighbors:\n   - Left (q[n-1]) | Center (q[n]) | Right (q[n+1]) | Center's next state (q[n] next)\n   - 1                | 1                | 1                | 0\n   - 1                | 1                | 0                | 1\n   - 1                | 0                | 1                | 0\n   - 1                | 0                | 0                | 1\n   - 0                | 1                | 1                | 1\n   - 0                | 1                | 0                | 0\n   - 0                | 0                | 1                | 1\n   - 0                | 0                | 0                | 0\n\n4. The boundaries of the cellular automaton are defined as:\n   - q[-1] = 0 (off)\n   - q[512] = 0 (off)\n\nOperational Behavior:\n- On the positive edge of the clk signal:\n  - If load is asserted (load = 1), the state of the cellular automaton is initialized with the value from data[511:0].\n  - If load is not asserted (load = 0), the next state of each cell is computed based on the current states of its neighbors according to Rule 90.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- There is no explicit reset signal defined; however, the initial state can be loaded using the load signal.\n\nTiming:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The state of the output q is updated every clock cycle based on the current state and the load signal.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the behavior of the module is well-defined for all possible input combinations, particularly when the load signal is toggled during operation.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
