Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - y: 3-bit input (bit[2:0] where bit[0] is the least significant bit)
  - w: 1-bit input (bit[0])
  
- Output Ports:
  - Y1: 1-bit output (bit[0])

State Machine Description:
The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states and transitions:

States:
- A (000)
- B (001)
- C (010)
- D (011)
- E (100)
- F (101)

State Transitions:
- From state A (000):
  - On input w = 0, transition to state B (001)
  - On input w = 1, remain in state A (000)
  
- From state B (001):
  - On input w = 0, transition to state C (010)
  - On input w = 1, transition to state D (011)
  
- From state C (010):
  - On input w = 0, transition to state E (100)
  - On input w = 1, transition to state D (011)
  
- From state D (011):
  - On input w = 0, transition to state F (101)
  - On input w = 1, transition to state A (000)
  
- From state E (100):
  - On input w = 0, remain in state E (100)
  - On input w = 1, transition to state D (011)
  
- From state F (101):
  - On input w = 0, transition to state C (010)
  - On input w = 1, transition to state D (011)

Implementation Details:
- The FSM will be implemented using three D flip-flops to represent the state.
- The next-state logic will be implemented for the state represented by y[1].
- The output Y1 will be directly assigned the value of y[1].

Reset Conditions:
- The FSM will have an asynchronous active-low reset signal (reset_n) that initializes the state to A (000) when asserted.

Clocking:
- The FSM will operate on the rising edge of a clock signal (clk).

Initial Conditions:
- All flip-flops will be initialized to 0 upon reset.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the FSM handles all possible input combinations for w (0 and 1) at each state without undefined behavior.
