<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the `shift_ena` signal. The FSM should enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles when reset is asserted and then remain disabled until the next reset. The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the rising edge of the clock.

1. **State Encoding**: We will use a simple counter to track the number of cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted. The counter will count from 0 to 3, representing the 4 cycles.

2. **State Transition**: 
   - On reset, the counter is initialized to 0, and `shift_ena` is asserted.
   - On each clock cycle, if the counter is less than 3, it increments by 1, keeping `shift_ena` asserted.
   - Once the counter reaches 3, `shift_ena` is deasserted, and the counter stops incrementing.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented within the clocked always block, ensuring that the reset is synchronous.

4. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` output is directly driven by the state of the counter.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, and the always block will be sensitive to the positive edge of the clock only, as per the synchronous reset requirement.
