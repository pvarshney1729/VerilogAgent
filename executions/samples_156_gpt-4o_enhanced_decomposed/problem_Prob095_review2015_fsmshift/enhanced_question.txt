Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high, synchronous reset signal)
  
- Output Ports:
  - shift_ena: 1-bit output (enables the shift register)

Functional Description:
This module is part of a finite state machine (FSM) designed to control a shift register. The output signal `shift_ena` should be asserted (set to high) for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles when a specific bit pattern is detected. 

Reset Behavior:
- Upon activation of the `reset` signal, the `shift_ena` output should be asserted for 4 clock cycles, after which it should be deasserted (set to low) indefinitely until the next reset occurs.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning that the reset state of the module is only evaluated on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic within this module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

Initial Conditions:
- The initial state of the `shift_ena` output should be low (0) when the module is powered on or after a reset.

Edge Case Handling:
- Ensure that the `shift_ena` output does not inadvertently assert for more than 4 cycles, regardless of the input conditions after the initial detection of the bit pattern.

Signal Dependencies:
- The assertion of `shift_ena` is dependent on the detection of the specific bit pattern, which should be clearly defined in the implementation.
