        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, active on the rising edge)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high, synchronous reset signal)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - shift_ena: 1-bit output (enables the shift register)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThis module is part of a finite state machine (FSM) designed to control a shift register. The output signal `shift_ena` should be asserted (set to high) for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles when a specific bit pattern is detected. \n\nReset Behavior:\n- Upon activation of the `reset` signal, the `shift_ena` output should be asserted for 4 clock cycles, after which it should be deasserted (set to low) indefinitely until the next reset occurs.\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning that the reset state of the module is only evaluated on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential logic within this module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The initial state of the `shift_ena` output should be low (0) when the module is powered on or after a reset.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Ensure that the `shift_ena` output does not inadvertently assert for more than 4 cycles, regardless of the input conditions after the initial detection of the bit pattern.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The assertion of `shift_ena` is dependent on the detection of the specific bit pattern, which should be clearly defined in the implementation.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.
