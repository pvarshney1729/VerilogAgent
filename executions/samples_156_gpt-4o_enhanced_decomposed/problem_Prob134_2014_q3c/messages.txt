        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - x: 1-bit input (control signal)\n  - y: 3-bit input (current state, indexed as y[2] (MSB) to y[0] (LSB))\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - Y0: 1-bit output (the least significant bit of the next state signal Y)\n  - z: 1-bit output (output signal based on the state machine logic)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with the following characteristics:\n\n1. State Transition Logic:\n   - The FSM transitions between states based on the current state represented by the input y[2:0] and the control signal x.\n   - The next state Y[2:0] is determined by the following state transition table:\n\n   | Present State (y[2:0]) | Next State (Y[2:0] when x=0) | Next State (Y[2:0] when x=1) | Output (z) |\n   |-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n   | 000                     | 000                           | 001                           | 0           |\n   | 001                     | 001                           | 100                           | 0           |\n   | 010                     | 010                           | 001                           | 0           |\n   | 011                     | 001                           | 010                           | 1           |\n   | 100                     | 011                           | 100                           | 1           |\n\n2. Output Logic:\n   - The output Y0 is defined as Y[0], which is the least significant bit of the next state signal Y.\n\n3. Clocking and Reset:\n   - The FSM operates on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n   - The module does not specify a reset condition; therefore, the initial state of the FSM should be defined as 000 (y = 3'b000) upon the first clock cycle.\n\n4. Sequential Logic:\n   - The state transitions and output generation are to be implemented using flip-flops for the state storage and combinational logic for the next state and output logic.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n   - The module should handle all defined states as per the state transition table without undefined behavior for any input combinations.\n\n6. Signal Dependencies:\n   - Ensure that the next state logic is evaluated based on the current state and input x without race conditions.\n\n7. Bit Indexing:\n   - The bits of the input y and output Y are indexed from 2 (MSB) to 0 (LSB).\n                    "
