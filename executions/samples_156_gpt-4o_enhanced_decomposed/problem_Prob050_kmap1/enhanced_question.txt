Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a;  // 1-bit input representing variable 'a'
  - input wire b;  // 1-bit input representing variable 'b'
  - input wire c;  // 1-bit input representing variable 'c'
  
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out;  // 1-bit output representing the result of the logic function

Functional Description:
The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the provided Karnaugh map. The output 'out' is determined by the following conditions based on the values of inputs 'a', 'b', and 'c':

Karnaugh Map:
          a
   bc   0   1
   00 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 1 |
   11 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 |

Truth Table Representation:
| b | c | a | out |
|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0   |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1   |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1   |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1   |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1   |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1   |

Notes:
- The output 'out' is a direct result of the combinational logic derived from the Karnaugh map.
- Ensure that all input signals are treated as unsigned 1-bit values.
- The module does not include any sequential logic or state retention; therefore, no clock or reset signals are required.
