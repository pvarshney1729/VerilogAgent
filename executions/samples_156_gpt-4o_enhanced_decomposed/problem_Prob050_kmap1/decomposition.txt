Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - output out

The module should implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map
below.

          a
   bc   0   1
   00 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 1 |
   11 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 |
