<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule` based on the given Karnaugh map, we need to derive the logic expression from the map. The Karnaugh map provided is:

```
          a
   bc   0   1
   00 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 1 |
   11 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 |
```

From the map, we can see that the output `out` is `1` for all cases except when `a = 0` and `b = 0` and `c = 0`. This can be simplified to the logic expression:

`out = a | b | c`

This expression means that `out` will be `1` if any of the inputs `a`, `b`, or `c` is `1`. This is a simple OR operation among the inputs.

Now, let's implement this logic in Verilog. We will use an `assign` statement for combinational logic, as it is straightforward and efficient for this purpose. We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing the logic derived from the Karnaugh map
    assign out = a | b | c;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>

Generated Code:

module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing the logic derived from the Karnaugh map
    assign out = a | b | c;
endmodule
