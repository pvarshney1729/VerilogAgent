        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal)\n  - predict_valid: 1-bit input (indicates if a prediction is valid)\n  - predict_taken: 1-bit input (indicates the predicted direction of the branch)\n  - train_mispredicted: 1-bit input (indicates if a misprediction has occurred)\n  - train_taken: 1-bit input (indicates the actual direction of the branch)\n  - train_history: 32-bit input (history of branches prior to the mispredicted branch)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - predict_history: 32-bit output (current state of the branch history register)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a 32-bit global history shift register that maintains the history of branch predictions. The following behaviors are defined:\n\n1. **Branch Prediction Update**:\n   - When `predict_valid` is asserted (i.e., `predict_valid = 1`), the module will shift in the value of `predict_taken` from the least significant bit (LSB) side (i.e., `predict_history[0]` will be updated with `predict_taken`).\n   - The `predict_history` register represents the history of the most recent branches, with `predict_history[0]` being the direction of the youngest branch.\n\n2. **Branch Misprediction Handling**:\n   - If a misprediction occurs (i.e., `train_mispredicted = 1`), the module will load the `predict_history` register with a new value. This new value is formed by concatenating `train_history` (the history before the mispredicted branch) with `train_taken` (the actual result of the branch).\n   - In the event that both a prediction and a misprediction occur simultaneously, the misprediction takes precedence. This is because the pipeline flush will invalidate the current prediction.\n\n3. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - The `areset` signal is an asynchronous reset that, when asserted, will reset the `predict_history` register to zero (i.e., `predict_history = 32'b0`).\n   - The reset is effective immediately upon assertion of `areset`, regardless of the clock state.\n\n4. **Clocking and Sequential Logic**:\n   - All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n\n5. **Signal Definitions**:\n   - The `predict_history` output reflects the current state of the branch history register after processing the inputs.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that the module correctly handles cases where `predict_valid` and `train_mispredicted` are asserted simultaneously, prioritizing the misprediction.\n- The module should maintain consistent behavior when inputs are toggled rapidly, ensuring that the state of `predict_history` is stable and predictable.\n                    "
