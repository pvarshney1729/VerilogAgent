Modified Base Query:


I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  predict_valid
 - input  predict_taken
 - input  train_mispredicted
 - input  train_taken
 - input  train_history   (32 bits)
 - output predict_history (32 bits)

The module should implement a 32-bit global history shift register,
including support for rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush
caused by a branch misprediction. When a branch prediction is made
(predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update
the branch history for the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the
direction of the youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs
(train_mispredicted = 1), load the branch history register with the
history after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the
history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with
the actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and
misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence,
because the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is
currently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch
history register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset
that resets the history counter to zero. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
