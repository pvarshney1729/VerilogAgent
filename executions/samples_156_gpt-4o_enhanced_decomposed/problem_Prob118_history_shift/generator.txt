<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a 32-bit shift register that updates based on branch prediction and misprediction signals. The module should handle the following scenarios:

1. **Asynchronous Reset**: When `areset` is asserted, the history register should be reset to zero. This is an asynchronous operation, so it should be handled separately from the clocked operations.

2. **Branch Prediction**: When `predict_valid` is high, the `predict_taken` bit should be shifted into the LSB of the history register. This operation is synchronous with the clock.

3. **Branch Misprediction**: If `train_mispredicted` is high, the history register should be loaded with `train_history` concatenated with `train_taken`. This operation takes precedence over the branch prediction, as it corrects the history due to a pipeline flush.

4. **Priority Handling**: If both `predict_valid` and `train_mispredicted` are high, the misprediction handling should take precedence.

5. **Output**: The `predict_history` should always reflect the current state of the history register.

The implementation will use a sequential always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock to handle the synchronous operations, and an asynchronous block for the reset.
