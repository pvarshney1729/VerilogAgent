<REASONING>
To implement a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with the specified interface. The NOR gate is a basic digital logic gate that outputs true or high only when both inputs are false or low. In Verilog, this can be implemented using the NOR operator (`~|`), which performs a bitwise NOR operation.

The module will have two inputs, `in1` and `in2`, and one output, `out`. Since the task is to implement combinational logic, we will use an `assign` statement to directly assign the result of the NOR operation to the output. This approach is efficient and adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided.

We will declare all ports as `logic` as per the coding conventions, even though for simple combinational logic, `wire` could also be used. However, using `logic` is more modern and aligns with SystemVerilog practices.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic in1,
    input logic in2,
    output logic out
);
    // Implementing a 2-input NOR gate
    assign out = ~(in1 | in2);
endmodule
[DONE]
