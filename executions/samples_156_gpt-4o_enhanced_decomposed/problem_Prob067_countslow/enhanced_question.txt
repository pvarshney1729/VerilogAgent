Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)
  - slowena: 1-bit input (enable signal for counter increment)
  
- Output Ports:
  - q: 4-bit output (counter value, representing the count from 0 to 9)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a counting period of 10 clock cycles. The counter increments its value only when the slowena input is high. 

Reset Behavior:
- The reset input is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), the counter (q) is reset to 4'b0000 (0).
- The counter will remain in the reset state until the reset signal is deasserted (reset = 0).

Counting Behavior:
- The counter increments its value on the positive edge of the clk signal, but only if the slowena input is high (slowena = 1).
- If the counter reaches the value of 9 (4'b1001), it will reset to 0 (4'b0000) on the next increment.

Signal Definitions:
- The output q is a 4-bit vector where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).
- The counter should handle all edge cases, including the transition from 9 to 0.

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- Ensure that there are no race conditions in the implementation, particularly concerning the reset and slowena signals.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon initialization, the counter (q) should be set to 4'b0000.

Edge Cases:
- The module should be tested for behavior when reset is asserted during counting and when slowena transitions between high and low states.
