        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - reset: 1-bit input (active high synchronous reset)\n  - slowena: 1-bit input (enable signal for counter increment)\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 4-bit output (counter value, representing the count from 0 to 9)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a counting period of 10 clock cycles. The counter increments its value only when the slowena input is high. \n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset input is active high and synchronous. When reset is asserted (reset = 1), the counter (q) is reset to 4'b0000 (0).\n- The counter will remain in the reset state until the reset signal is deasserted (reset = 0).\n\nCounting Behavior:\n- The counter increments its value on the positive edge of the clk signal, but only if the slowena input is high (slowena = 1).\n- If the counter reaches the value of 9 (4'b1001), it will reset to 0 (4'b0000) on the next increment.\n\nSignal Definitions:\n- The output q is a 4-bit vector where q[0] is the least significant bit (LSB) and q[3] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n- The counter should handle all edge cases, including the transition from 9 to 0.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions in the implementation, particularly concerning the reset and slowena signals.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon initialization, the counter (q) should be set to 4'b0000.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should be tested for behavior when reset is asserted during counting and when slowena transitions between high and low states.\n                    "
