Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous reset signal, active high)
  - x: 1-bit input (serial input data, least significant bit first)

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output (2's complement of the input x)

Functional Description:
The TopModule implements a Moore state machine that computes the 2's complement of a serial input stream (x). The input (x) is provided one bit per clock cycle, starting with the least significant bit (LSB). The output (z) represents the 2's complement of the accumulated input.

Operation:
- The state machine begins processing the input when the asynchronous reset (areset) is released (deasserted).
- The conversion process continues until the asynchronous reset (areset) is asserted (active).
- The output (z) will reflect the 2's complement of the input after the last bit has been processed.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset (areset) is asynchronous and active high.
- Upon assertion of areset, all internal registers and state variables should be initialized to a defined state (e.g., zero).

Sequential Logic:
- All sequential elements within the module are triggered on the positive edge of the clock (clk).
- Ensure that all flip-flops and registers have explicitly defined initial values upon reset.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle arbitrary lengths of input numbers, with the understanding that the output will only be valid after the last bit of the input has been received and processed.
- The output (z) should be stable and reflect the correct 2's complement value until the next reset or input bit is processed.

Signal Dependencies:
- Ensure that the output (z) is updated based on the current state of the input (x) and the clock cycles, with no race conditions present in the design.
