<REASONING>
To implement a Moore state machine for a serial 2's complementer, we need to consider the following:

1. **State Definition**: The state machine will have two states:
   - `IDLE`: Waiting for the reset to be de-asserted.
   - `COMPLEMENT`: Actively processing the input bits to produce the 2's complement.

2. **State Transition**: 
   - On reset, the machine should go to the `IDLE` state.
   - When reset is de-asserted, the machine transitions to the `COMPLEMENT` state and starts processing the input bits.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - In the `COMPLEMENT` state, the output `z` should be the bitwise NOT of the input `x` plus a carry bit that starts as 1 (to account for the 2's complement operation).

4. **Carry Management**:
   - The carry bit should be initialized to 1 when entering the `COMPLEMENT` state.
   - The carry is updated based on the current input and the previous carry.

5. **Asynchronous Reset**:
   - The reset is asynchronous, so it should immediately set the state to `IDLE` and reset the carry.

6. **Clock Edge**:
   - The state transitions and output updates should occur on the positive edge of the clock.
