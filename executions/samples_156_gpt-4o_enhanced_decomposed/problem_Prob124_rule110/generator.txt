<REASONING>
To implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton in Verilog, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with the specified interface. The module will have a 512-bit input `data` and a 512-bit output `q`. The `clk` input will be used to synchronize the updates of the cellular automaton, and the `load` input will allow us to initialize the state of the automaton with the `data` input.

The Rule 110 automaton updates each cell based on its current state and the state of its two neighbors. The boundary conditions assume that the cells outside the range (i.e., `q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are always zero.

The implementation will use a shift register approach, where each bit in the `q` register represents a cell in the automaton. On each positive edge of the clock, if `load` is high, the `q` register will be loaded with the `data` input. Otherwise, the next state of each cell will be computed based on the Rule 110 table.

The logic for updating each cell will be implemented using a combinational always block, which will compute the next state for each cell based on its current state and the states of its neighbors. The results will be stored in a temporary register, which will then be assigned to `q` at the next clock edge.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic load,
    input logic [511:0] data,
    output logic [511:0] q
);

    logic [511:0] next_state;

    always @(*) begin
        // Compute the next state for each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
            logic left = (i == 511) ? 1'b0 : q[i+1];
            logic center = q[i];
            logic right = (i == 0) ? 1'b0 : q[i-1];

            // Apply Rule 110
            next_state[i] = (left & center & ~right) |
                            (left & ~center & right) |
                            (~left & center & right) |
                            (~left & center & ~right);
        end
    end

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            q <= next_state;
        end
