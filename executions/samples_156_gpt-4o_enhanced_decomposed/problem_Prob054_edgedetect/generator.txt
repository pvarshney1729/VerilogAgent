<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to detect a positive edge on each bit of the 8-bit input vector `in`. A positive edge is defined as a transition from 0 to 1. We will use a register to store the previous state of the input vector so that we can compare it with the current state to detect the transition.

1. **Input and Output Declaration**: The module has an 8-bit input `in` and an 8-bit output `pedge`. The `clk` input is used for clocking the sequential logic.

2. **Previous State Register**: We need a register to hold the previous state of the input vector. This will be updated on every positive edge of the clock.

3. **Edge Detection Logic**: For each bit in the input vector, we will compare the current state with the previous state. If the previous state is 0 and the current state is 1, it indicates a positive edge, and we will set the corresponding bit in the output `pedge`.

4. **Sequential Logic**: We will use an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock to update the previous state and compute the edge detection.

5. **Initialization**: In simulation, we will initialize the previous state register to zero.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] pedge
);

    // Register to hold the previous state of the input
    logic [7:0] prev_in;

    // Sequential logic to update previous state and detect positive edges
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        // Detect positive edge for each bit
        pedge <= (~prev_in) & in;
        // Update previous state
        prev_in <= in;
    end

endmodule
