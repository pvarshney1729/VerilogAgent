        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input signal (clock)\n  - in: 8-bit input vector (in[7:0]), where in[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and in[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - pedge: 8-bit output vector (pedge[7:0]), where pedge[0] corresponds to the detection of a positive edge on in[0] and pedge[7] corresponds to in[7].\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe TopModule shall detect positive edges in the 8-bit input vector 'in'. A positive edge is defined as a transition from 0 to 1 in any bit position of the input vector between consecutive clock cycles. The output vector 'pedge' will be updated to reflect these transitions.\n\nBehavior:\n- For each bit in the input vector 'in', the corresponding bit in the output vector 'pedge' will be set to 1 in the clock cycle immediately following a detected transition from 0 to 1. If no transition occurs for a specific bit, the corresponding bit in 'pedge' will remain 0.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The module will utilize a rising edge-triggered flip-flop for the output 'pedge'. The output will be updated on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module does not specify a reset condition. Therefore, the initial state of 'pedge' is undefined until the first clock cycle.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If 'in' remains constant (either all 0s or all 1s) across clock cycles, 'pedge' will reflect this by remaining unchanged.\n- If multiple bits transition from 0 to 1 simultaneously, all corresponding bits in 'pedge' will be set to 1 in the next clock cycle.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output 'pedge' is dependent on the previous state of 'in' from the last clock cycle. Ensure that the implementation correctly captures the state of 'in' at the previous clock cycle to detect transitions accurately.\n                    "

Recall the guidelines: <Original Question>\nI would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following\ninterface.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
