        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)\n  - resetn: 1-bit input (active-low synchronous reset)\n  - byteena: 2-bit input (byte enable signals)\n    - byteena[1]: controls write access to the upper byte (d[15:8])\n    - byteena[0]: controls write access to the lower byte (d[7:0])\n  - d: 16-bit input (data to be written to the registers)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 16-bit output (data stored in the registers)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module contains 16 D flip-flops (DFFs) that store the 16-bit data input (d). The byteena signals determine which bytes of the DFFs are updated during each clock cycle. \n\nBehavior:\n- The DFFs are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- The resetn signal is a synchronous, active-low reset. When resetn is low, all DFFs are reset to 0. When resetn is high, the DFFs will operate normally based on the clk and byteena inputs.\n- The output q reflects the current state of the DFFs.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The write operation to the DFFs occurs only when the corresponding byteena signals are high.\n- If byteena[1] is high, d[15:8] is written to the upper byte of the DFFs.\n- If byteena[0] is high, d[7:0] is written to the lower byte of the DFFs.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If both byteena signals are low, no updates occur to the DFFs during that clock cycle.\n- The resetn signal takes precedence over the data input during the reset condition.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- All DFFs should be initialized to 0 upon reset.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n"
