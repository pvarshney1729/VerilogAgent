Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal)
  - resetn: 1-bit input (active-low synchronous reset)
  - byteena: 2-bit input (byte enable signals)
    - byteena[1]: controls write access to the upper byte (d[15:8])
    - byteena[0]: controls write access to the lower byte (d[7:0])
  - d: 16-bit input (data to be written to the registers)

- Output Ports:
  - q: 16-bit output (data stored in the registers)

Functional Description:
The module contains 16 D flip-flops (DFFs) that store the 16-bit data input (d). The byteena signals determine which bytes of the DFFs are updated during each clock cycle. 

Behavior:
- The DFFs are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The resetn signal is a synchronous, active-low reset. When resetn is low, all DFFs are reset to 0. When resetn is high, the DFFs will operate normally based on the clk and byteena inputs.
- The output q reflects the current state of the DFFs.

Signal Dependencies:
- The write operation to the DFFs occurs only when the corresponding byteena signals are high.
- If byteena[1] is high, d[15:8] is written to the upper byte of the DFFs.
- If byteena[0] is high, d[7:0] is written to the lower byte of the DFFs.

Edge Cases:
- If both byteena signals are low, no updates occur to the DFFs during that clock cycle.
- The resetn signal takes precedence over the data input during the reset condition.

Initial Conditions:
- All DFFs should be initialized to 0 upon reset.
