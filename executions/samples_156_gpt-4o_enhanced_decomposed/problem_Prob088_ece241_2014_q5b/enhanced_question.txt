Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input (clock signal, positive edge-triggered)
  - areset: 1-bit input (asynchronous active-high reset)
  - x: 1-bit input (data input)

- Output Ports:
  - z: 1-bit output (data output)

Functional Description:
The module implements a Mealy finite-state machine (FSM) that functions as a 2's complementer using one-hot encoding for state representation. The FSM has the following states:
- State A (encoded as 2'b01)
- State B (encoded as 2'b10)

Reset Behavior:
- The FSM resets asynchronously to State A when the areset signal is high. In State A, the output z is 0. 

State Transition and Output Logic:
- From State A:
  - If x = 0, remain in State A (z = 0).
  - If x = 1, transition to State B (z = 1).
  
- From State B:
  - If x = 0, remain in State B (z = 1).
  - If x = 1, remain in State B (z = 0).

Sequential Logic:
- All state transitions and output logic are triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.

Initial Conditions:
- All flip-flops and registers should be initialized to a defined state upon reset. Specifically, upon activation of areset, the FSM should enter State A.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the FSM handles transitions correctly when x changes state during the clock cycle.
- Confirm that the output z reflects the correct value immediately based on the current state and input x.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z is dependent on the current state of the FSM and the input x, following the defined state transition rules.
