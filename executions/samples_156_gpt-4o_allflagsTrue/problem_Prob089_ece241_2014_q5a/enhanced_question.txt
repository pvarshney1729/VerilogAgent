Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.
  - `input wire areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high.
  - `input wire x`: Serial input bit stream, processed one bit per clock cycle.
- Outputs:
  - `output reg z`: Serial output representing the 2's complement of the input.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a one-input, one-output Moore state machine to compute the 2's complement of a serial bit stream.
- The input `x` is presented as a series of bits, starting from the least-significant bit (LSB) of the number.
- The output `z` provides the corresponding 2's complement bit for each input bit, with a one-clock-cycle delay due to the sequential nature of the state machine.

Reset Behavior:
- The module features an asynchronous reset (`areset`), which, when asserted high, will reset the state machine to its initial state immediately, regardless of the clock signal.
- When `areset` is deasserted (low), the state machine resumes operation, processing `x` on each positive clock edge.

State Machine Details:
- The Moore state machine operates based on the current state and input `x`, updating the state and output `z` on the positive edge of `clk`.
- The initial state, upon reset, should prepare the machine to start processing the input bit stream from an initial known state.

Sequential Logic:
- All internal registers and flip-flops should be initialized to a defined state upon reset to ensure deterministic operation.
- The state transitions and output logic should be clearly defined to handle all possible input sequences and edge cases, including very short or very long input sequences.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The system should correctly handle input sequences of arbitrary length, producing a valid 2's complement output for the entire sequence.
- Care must be taken to handle transitions correctly at the end of input sequences and during continuous operation without reset interruptions.

Assumptions:
- The number of bits in the input sequence is not predetermined and can vary with each operation cycle.
- The input sequence is considered to end when `areset` is asserted or when processing is otherwise interrupted.

Debugging and Verification:
- Ensure comprehensive test cases cover typical, edge, and boundary conditions, verifying both correct output generation and proper state transitions.

Note: The module should be designed to avoid race conditions, ensuring clear precedence of operations in all scenarios.
