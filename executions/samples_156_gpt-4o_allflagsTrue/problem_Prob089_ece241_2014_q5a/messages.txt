Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high.\n  - `input wire x`: Serial input bit stream, processed one bit per clock cycle.\n- Outputs:\n  - `output reg z`: Serial output representing the 2's complement of the input.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a one-input, one-output Moore state machine to compute the 2's complement of a serial bit stream.\n- The input `x` is presented as a series of bits, starting from the least-significant bit (LSB) of the number.\n- The output `z` provides the corresponding 2's complement bit for each input bit, with a one-clock-cycle delay due to the sequential nature of the state machine.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The module features an asynchronous reset (`areset`), which, when asserted high, will reset the state machine to its initial state immediately, regardless of the clock signal.\n- When `areset` is deasserted (low), the state machine resumes operation, processing `x` on each positive clock edge.\n\nState Machine Details:\n- The Moore state machine operates based on the current state and input `x`, updating the state and output `z` on the positive edge of `clk`.\n- The initial state, upon reset, should prepare the machine to start processing the input bit stream from an initial known state.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- All internal registers and flip-flops should be initialized to a defined state upon reset to ensure deterministic operation.\n- The state transitions and output logic should be clearly defined to handle all possible input sequences and edge cases, including very short or very long input sequences.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The system should correctly handle input sequences of arbitrary length, producing a valid 2's complement output for the entire sequence.\n- Care must be taken to handle transitions correctly at the end of input sequences and during continuous operation without reset interruptions.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The number of bits in the input sequence is not predetermined and can vary with each operation cycle.\n- The input sequence is considered to end when `areset` is asserted or when processing is otherwise interrupted.\n\nDebugging and Verification:\n- Ensure comprehensive test cases cover typical, edge, and boundary conditions, verifying both correct output generation and proper state transitions.\n\nNote: The module should be designed to avoid race conditions, ensuring clear precedence of operations in all scenarios.\n                    "

The machine will\naccept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive\nedge triggered asynchronous reset. The conversion begins when Reset is\nreleased and stops when Reset is asserted. Assume all sequential logic is\ntriggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

The module is designed as a Moore state machine with two states: INVERT and PASS. The INVERT state is responsible for generating the 2's complement by inverting the input bit x, while the PASS state simply passes the input bit as is. The state machine transitions from INVERT to PASS on the next clock cycle after reset is deasserted. The asynchronous reset initializes the state to INVERT, ensuring the machine starts in the correct state to begin the 2's complement operation. The output logic is determined by the current state, adhering to the Moore machine principle where the output depends only on the current state.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        INVERT = 2'b00,\n        PASS = 2'b01\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= INVERT;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            INVERT: next_state = PASS;\n            PASS: next_state = PASS;\n            default: next_state = INVERT;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            INVERT: z = ~x;\n            PASS: z = x;\n            default: z = 1'b0;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"
