Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for `TopModule`:\n\n1. **Module Ports**:\n   - `input clk`: Clock signal, active on the rising edge.\n   - `input resetn`: Active-low, synchronous reset signal.\n   - `input [2:0] r`: 3-bit input vector representing requests from three devices. Each bit `r[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 2) corresponds to a request from device `i`, with `r[0]` being the highest priority and `r[2]` the lowest.\n   - `output reg [2:0] g`: 3-bit output vector representing grants for the three devices. Each bit `g[i]` corresponds to a grant for device `i`.\n\n2. **State Definitions**:\n   - State Encoding (binary representation suggestive, modify as needed):\n     - `STATE_A`: 2'b00\n     - `STATE_B`: 2'b01\n     - `STATE_C`: 2'b10\n     - `STATE_D`: 2'b11\n\n3. **FSM Behavior**:\n   - The FSM will start in `STATE_A` after reset.\n   - `STATE_A` Transitions:\n     - Remain in `STATE_A` if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 0` and `r[2] == 0`.\n     - Transition to `STATE_B` if `r[0] == 1`.\n     - Transition to `STATE_C` if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 1`.\n     - Transition to `STATE_D` if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 0` and `r[2] == 1`.\n   - `STATE_B` Transitions:\n     - Remain in `STATE_B` if `r[0] == 1`.\n     - Transition to `STATE_A` if `r[0] == 0`.\n   - `STATE_C` Transitions:\n     - Remain in `STATE_C` if `r[1] == 1`.\n     - Transition to `STATE_A` if `r[1] == 0`.\n\n4. **Output Behavior**:\n   - In `STATE_B`: `g[0] = 1`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 0`.\n   - In `STATE_C`: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 1`, `g[2] = 0`.\n   - In `STATE_D`: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 1`.\n   - In `STATE_A`: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 0`.\n\n5. **Implementation Requirements**:\n   - Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and state register updates.\n   - The state transition logic should be implemented in a combinational always block, sensitive to the current state and input `r`.\n   - State register updates should occur in a sequential always block, sensitive to the positive edge of `clk` and `resetn`.\n   - Ensure that the reset logic sets the state to `STATE_A` and all output grants `g[i]` to 0.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Priorities**:\n   - Ensure the priority handling such that device 0 has the highest priority, followed by device 1, then device 2.\n   - If multiple requests occur simultaneously, the FSM should only grant the request with the highest priority.\n\nBy following this specification, the `TopModule` will correctly implement the described FSM with appropriate handling of requests and grant signals.\n                    "

The FSM transitions between states based on the current state and the request signals, with a synchronous reset that initializes the FSM to state A.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit enumeration, allowing for easy readability and maintainability.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An always block with a combinational sensitivity list (`always @(*)`) is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the request signals. The transitions are defined according to the priority and the state diagram provided.\n\n3. **State Flip-Flops**: A sequential always block (`always @(posedge clk)`) is used to update the current state based on the next state. The synchronous reset (`resetn`) ensures that the FSM initializes to state A when reset is asserted.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: Another combinational always block is used to determine the output grants `g[2:0]` based on the current state. The outputs are set according to the state diagram, with each state granting access to the corresponding device.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The module adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all ports and signals, and ensuring that all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nOverall, the implementation is structured to be clear, efficient, and in compliance with the provided specifications and guidelines.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic [2:0] r,\n    output logic [2:0] g\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (r[0])\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else if (r[1])\n                    next_state = STATE_C;\n                else if (r[2])\n                    next_state = STATE_D;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                if (r[0])\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_C: begin\n                if (r[1])\n                    next_state = STATE_C;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_D: begin\n                next_state = STATE_A; // Return to A when no requests\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // State flip-flops with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn)\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        g = 3'b000; // Default output\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_B: g[0] = 1;\n            STATE_C: g[1] = 1;\n            STATE_D: g[2] = 1;\n            // STATE_A: g is already set to 3'b000\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

Each device makes its request for\nthe resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either\n_r[0]_, _r[1]_, or _r[2]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and\nrepresents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long\nas there are no requests.

Each _g[i]_ is an\noutput from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 0 has a\nhigher priority than device 1, and device 2 has the lowest priority.\nHence, for example, device 2 will only receive a grant if it is the only\ndevice making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_,\nis given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant\nas long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\nImplement a module that represents this FSM.
