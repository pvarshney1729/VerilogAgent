Module Specification for `TopModule`:

1. **Module Ports**:
   - `input clk`: Clock signal, active on the rising edge.
   - `input resetn`: Active-low, synchronous reset signal.
   - `input [2:0] r`: 3-bit input vector representing requests from three devices. Each bit `r[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 2) corresponds to a request from device `i`, with `r[0]` being the highest priority and `r[2]` the lowest.
   - `output reg [2:0] g`: 3-bit output vector representing grants for the three devices. Each bit `g[i]` corresponds to a grant for device `i`.

2. **State Definitions**:
   - State Encoding (binary representation suggestive, modify as needed):
     - `STATE_A`: 2'b00
     - `STATE_B`: 2'b01
     - `STATE_C`: 2'b10
     - `STATE_D`: 2'b11

3. **FSM Behavior**:
   - The FSM will start in `STATE_A` after reset.
   - `STATE_A` Transitions:
     - Remain in `STATE_A` if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 0` and `r[2] == 0`.
     - Transition to `STATE_B` if `r[0] == 1`.
     - Transition to `STATE_C` if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 1`.
     - Transition to `STATE_D` if `r[0] == 0` and `r[1] == 0` and `r[2] == 1`.
   - `STATE_B` Transitions:
     - Remain in `STATE_B` if `r[0] == 1`.
     - Transition to `STATE_A` if `r[0] == 0`.
   - `STATE_C` Transitions:
     - Remain in `STATE_C` if `r[1] == 1`.
     - Transition to `STATE_A` if `r[1] == 0`.

4. **Output Behavior**:
   - In `STATE_B`: `g[0] = 1`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 0`.
   - In `STATE_C`: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 1`, `g[2] = 0`.
   - In `STATE_D`: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 1`.
   - In `STATE_A`: `g[0] = 0`, `g[1] = 0`, `g[2] = 0`.

5. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - Use separate always blocks for the state transition logic and state register updates.
   - The state transition logic should be implemented in a combinational always block, sensitive to the current state and input `r`.
   - State register updates should occur in a sequential always block, sensitive to the positive edge of `clk` and `resetn`.
   - Ensure that the reset logic sets the state to `STATE_A` and all output grants `g[i]` to 0.

6. **Edge Cases and Priorities**:
   - Ensure the priority handling such that device 0 has the highest priority, followed by device 1, then device 2.
   - If multiple requests occur simultaneously, the FSM should only grant the request with the highest priority.

By following this specification, the `TopModule` will correctly implement the described FSM with appropriate handling of requests and grant signals.
