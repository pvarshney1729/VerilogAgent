Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit input, used as the clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit input, asynchronous and active high. Resets the shift register.\n  - `load`: 1-bit input, synchronous and active high. Loads data into the shift register.\n  - `ena`: 1-bit input, synchronous and active high. Enables the right shift operation.\n  - `data`: 4-bit input, used for loading data into the shift register.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `q`: 4-bit output, representing the contents of the shift register.\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. Asynchronous Reset (`areset`):\n   - When `areset` is asserted (high), the shift register `q` is immediately reset to 4'b0000, regardless of the clock.\n\n2. Load Operation (`load`):\n   - When `load` is asserted (high) on the positive edge of `clk`, the shift register `q` is synchronously loaded with `data[3:0]`.\n\n3. Enable Operation (`ena`):\n   - When `ena` is asserted (high) and `load` is not asserted, on the positive edge of `clk`, the shift register performs a right shift operation.\n   - During the right shift, `q[3]` is set to 0, `q[2:0]` are shifted right, and `q[0]` is discarded.\n\n4. Priority:\n   - If both `load` and `ena` are asserted simultaneously, `load` takes precedence, and the shift register is loaded with `data[3:0]`.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- Bit indexing starts from 0, with `q[0]` being the least significant bit (LSB) and `q[3]` being the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If `areset` is asserted, it takes precedence over both `load` and `ena`.\n- The reset state of the shift register is explicitly defined as 4'b0000.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The behavior described assumes ideal conditions without race conditions or glitches.\n- All operations other than reset are synchronized to the positive edge of `clk`.\n                    "

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and includes the specified input and output ports. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The `always` block is sensitive to both the positive edge of `clk` and `areset`. When `areset` is asserted, the shift register `q` is immediately reset to `4'b0000`.\n\n3. **Load Operation**: If `areset` is not asserted, the next priority is given to the `load` signal. When `load` is high, the shift register `q` is loaded with the value of `data`.\n\n4. **Enable Operation**: If neither `areset` nor `load` is asserted, and if `ena` is high, the shift register performs a right shift. The most significant bit `q[3]` is set to `0`, and the rest of the bits are shifted right.\n\n5. **Priority Handling**: The priority of operations is handled within the `always` block. The `areset` has the highest priority, followed by `load`, and then `ena`.\n\n6. **Sensitivity List**: The `always` block includes `areset` in the sensitivity list to ensure asynchronous reset functionality. The rest of the operations are synchronized with the clock.\n\n7. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals and ensuring that the `always` block is properly structured with the correct sensitivity list.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the shift register behaves as specified, with the correct handling of reset, load, and enable operations.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic load,\n    input logic ena,\n    input logic [3:0] data,\n    output logic [3:0] q\n);\n\nalways @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset) begin\n        q <= 4'b0000;\n    end else if (load) begin\n        q <= data;\n    end else if (ena) begin\n        q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]};\n    end\nend\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The module is a 4-bit shift register with specific control signals for reset, load, and enable operations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. All ports are declared as `logic` to follow the coding conventions.\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active high. This means that whenever `areset` is high, the shift register `q` should be reset to `4'b0000` immediately, regardless of the clock. This is implemented by including `areset` in the sensitivity list of the `always` block.\n\n3. **Load Operation**: The `load` signal is synchronous and active high. When `load` is high on the positive edge of the clock, the shift register `q` should be loaded with the value of `data[3:0]`. This operation takes precedence over the shift operation, so it is checked before the `ena` signal.\n\n4. **Enable Operation**: The `ena` signal is also synchronous and active high. When `ena` is high and `load` is not asserted, the shift register should perform a right shift operation. During this operation, `q[3]` is set to `0`, and `q[2:0]` are shifted right.\n\n5. **Priority Handling**: The `load` operation has higher priority than the `ena` operation. This is ensured by checking the `load` condition before the `ena` condition within the `always` block.\n\n6. **Sensitivity List**: The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of `clk` and `areset` to handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the module behaves as specified, with correct handling of reset, load, and shift operations.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic load,\n    input logic ena,\n    input logic [3:0] data,\n    output logic [3:0] q\n);\n\nalways @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n    if (areset) begin\n        q <= 4'b0000;\n    end else if (load) begin\n        q <= data;\n    end else if (ena) begin\n        q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]};\n    end\nend\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
