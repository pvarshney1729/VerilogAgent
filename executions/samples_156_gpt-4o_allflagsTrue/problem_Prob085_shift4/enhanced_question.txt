Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit input, used as the clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `areset`: 1-bit input, asynchronous and active high. Resets the shift register.
  - `load`: 1-bit input, synchronous and active high. Loads data into the shift register.
  - `ena`: 1-bit input, synchronous and active high. Enables the right shift operation.
  - `data`: 4-bit input, used for loading data into the shift register.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 4-bit output, representing the contents of the shift register.

Functional Description:
1. Asynchronous Reset (`areset`):
   - When `areset` is asserted (high), the shift register `q` is immediately reset to 4'b0000, regardless of the clock.

2. Load Operation (`load`):
   - When `load` is asserted (high) on the positive edge of `clk`, the shift register `q` is synchronously loaded with `data[3:0]`.

3. Enable Operation (`ena`):
   - When `ena` is asserted (high) and `load` is not asserted, on the positive edge of `clk`, the shift register performs a right shift operation.
   - During the right shift, `q[3]` is set to 0, `q[2:0]` are shifted right, and `q[0]` is discarded.

4. Priority:
   - If both `load` and `ena` are asserted simultaneously, `load` takes precedence, and the shift register is loaded with `data[3:0]`.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- Bit indexing starts from 0, with `q[0]` being the least significant bit (LSB) and `q[3]` being the most significant bit (MSB).

Edge Cases:
- If `areset` is asserted, it takes precedence over both `load` and `ena`.
- The reset state of the shift register is explicitly defined as 4'b0000.

Assumptions:
- The behavior described assumes ideal conditions without race conditions or glitches.
- All operations other than reset are synchronized to the positive edge of `clk`.
