To implement the given truth table, we need to derive a logical expression for the output 'f' based on the inputs x3, x2, and x1. By analyzing the truth table, we can identify the conditions under which 'f' is 1:

1. When x3 = 0, x2 = 1, regardless of x1 (rows 3 and 4).
2. When x3 = 1, x1 = 1, regardless of x2 (rows 6 and 8).

From these observations, we can derive the logical expression for 'f':
- 'f' is true when (x2 & ~x3) or (x1 & x3).

This expression can be directly implemented using combinational logic in Verilog. Since this is a purely combinational circuit, we use an `assign` statement to define the output 'f' based on the inputs. The use of `logic` for input and output ports is consistent with modern Verilog practices, which allow for more flexible signal declarations.
