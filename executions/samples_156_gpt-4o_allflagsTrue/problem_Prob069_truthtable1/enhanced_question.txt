Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule is a combinational logic circuit designed to implement a specific truth table using three one-bit inputs and a single one-bit output. The truth table defines the output based on the combinations of the three inputs.

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - input wire x3: Most significant input bit.
  - input wire x2: Middle significant input bit.
  - input wire x1: Least significant input bit.
- Output:
  - output wire f: The result of the logic operation based on the input conditions.

Truth Table Specification:
The output 'f' is determined by the combination of inputs x3, x2, and x1 according to the following truth table:

| x3 | x2 | x1 | f |
|----|----|----|---|
|  0 |  0 |  0 | 0 |
|  0 |  0 |  1 | 0 |
|  0 |  1 |  0 | 1 |
|  0 |  1 |  1 | 1 |
|  1 |  0 |  0 | 0 |
|  1 |  0 |  1 | 1 |
|  1 |  1 |  0 | 0 |
|  1 |  1 |  1 | 1 |

Operational Details:
- The module processes the inputs combinationally, meaning the output is directly determined by the current state of the inputs without any clock dependency.
- The inputs and output are interpreted as single bits (0 or 1), where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the logical operations implemented in Verilog reflect the conditions specified in the truth table directly.
- Consider using logic gates or conditional assignments in Verilog to achieve the desired output f based on the inputs x3, x2, and x1.
