The truth table defines the output based on the combinations of the three inputs.\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - input wire x3: Most significant input bit.\n  - input wire x2: Middle significant input bit.\n  - input wire x1: Least significant input bit.\n- Output:\n  - output wire f: The result of the logic operation based on the input conditions.\n\nTruth Table Specification:\nThe output 'f' is determined by the combination of inputs x3, x2, and x1 according to the following truth table:\n\n| x3 | x2 | x1 | f |\n|----|----|----|---|\n|  0 |  0 |  0 | 0 |\n|  0 |  0 |  1 | 0 |\n|  0 |  1 |  0 | 1 |\n|  0 |  1 |  1 | 1 |\n|  1 |  0 |  0 | 0 |\n|  1 |  0 |  1 | 1 |\n|  1 |  1 |  0 | 0 |\n|  1 |  1 |  1 | 1 |\n\nOperational Details:\n- The module processes the inputs combinationally, meaning the output is directly determined by the current state of the inputs without any clock dependency.\n- The inputs and output are interpreted as single bits (0 or 1), where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that the logical operations implemented in Verilog reflect the conditions specified in the truth table directly.\n- Consider using logic gates or conditional assignments in Verilog to achieve the desired output f based on the inputs x3, x2, and x1.\n                    "
