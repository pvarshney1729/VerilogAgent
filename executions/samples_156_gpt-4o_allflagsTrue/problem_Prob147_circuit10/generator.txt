<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `a`, `b`, and outputs `q`, `state`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **State Logic**: A single flip-flop is used to store the state, which is updated on the positive edge of the clock. The state is observable through the `state` output.

3. **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state and output `q` based on the current inputs `a`, `b`, and the current `state`. The logic is derived from the provided simulation waveforms.

4. **State Transition**: The `state_next` logic is determined by the combination of inputs and the current state. The waveform analysis suggests specific transitions and output conditions, which are implemented in the case statement.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `q` is determined by the same combinational logic that determines the next state. The conditions for `q` are derived from the waveform analysis.

6. **Sequential Logic**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block updates the `state` with `state_next` on the rising edge of the clock, ensuring synchronous operation.

7. **Default Conditions**: Default conditions are provided in the case statement to ensure defined behavior for all input combinations.

This implementation strictly follows the provided guidelines and coding conventions, ensuring correct functionality as per the waveform analysis.
