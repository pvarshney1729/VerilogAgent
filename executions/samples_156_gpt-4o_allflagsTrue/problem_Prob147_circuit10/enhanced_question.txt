<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, is designed to implement a sequential circuit with the following interface specifications. All input and output ports are one bit wide unless specified otherwise:

- Input: 
  - `clk`: Clock signal, used to trigger sequential logic on the positive edge.
  - `a`: Input signal `a`.
  - `b`: Input signal `b`.

- Output:
  - `q`: Output signal determined by the combinational and sequential logic.
  - `state`: Output signal representing the current state of the flip-flop (memory element).

Specifications:

1. **Port Definitions:**
   - All ports are one bit wide.
   - Bit[0] is the least significant bit for any multi-bit signals, though in this design, all signals are single bits.

2. **Sequential Logic:**
   - The circuit contains one flip-flop acting as the memory element.
   - The flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
   - The output of the flip-flop is observable through the `state` output port.

3. **Reset Behavior:**
   - The specification does not explicitly mention a reset signal or behavior.
   - Assume the flip-flop initializes to a defined state at the start of simulation or power-up. For this design, assume it initializes to logic '0'.

4. **Combinational Logic:**
   - The output `q` is derived from combinational logic based on inputs `a`, `b`, and the current state of the flip-flop.

5. **Behavioral Description:**
   - Analyze the provided simulation waveform to deduce the relationship between inputs `a`, `b`, the state of the flip-flop, and the output `q`.
   - From the waveform, `q` and `state` appear to have the following relationships:
     - `q` changes based on the combination of `a`, `b`, and the current `state`.
     - Specific waveform observations can be used to deduce logical conditions for state transitions and `q` output.

6. **Waveform Analysis:**
   - At time `15ns`, `state` and `q` are both `0` when `a` and `b` are `0`.
   - At time `45ns`, `state` is `0` and `q` becomes `1` when `b` is `1`.
   - At time `65ns`, when both `a` and `b` are `1`, `state` transitions to `0`.
   - At time `95ns`, `state` and `q` become `1` when `a` and `b` are both `1`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure behavior is defined for all possible input combinations, especially transitions from `0` to `1` and vice-versa for inputs `a` and `b`.

8. **Implementation Note:**
   - The precise logic function for `q` and state transitions must be derived from the waveform pattern provided, ensuring adherence to observed behavior.

This specification ensures clarity in the implementation of the `TopModule` by defining the interface, sequential and combinational logic, and utilizing waveform data to infer logical relationships.
