<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: `in1` (1-bit, unsigned)
- Input: `in2` (1-bit, unsigned)
- Output: `out` (1-bit, unsigned)

Circuit Description:
- The module implements a logic circuit where the two inputs `in1` and `in2` are processed through an AND gate.
- The input `in2` is inverted before entering the AND gate. This is equivalent to saying that `in2` is first passed through a NOT gate (indicated by the "bubble" on in2).
- The logical operation performed by the circuit can be mathematically expressed as `out = in1 AND NOT(in2)`.

Additional Details:
- All operations are combinational, with no clock or reset signals involved.
- The module operates purely on the current values of `in1` and `in2`. There are no sequential elements, and hence, no initial values or clock cycle dependencies to define.
- The output `out` is immediately responsive to changes in the input signals `in1` and `in2`.

Bit Conventions:
- The least significant bit (LSB) is referred to as bit[0] for all inputs and outputs.

Edge Cases:
- The circuit will handle all possible binary combinations of `in1` and `in2` (00, 01, 10, 11) without any undefined behavior.
