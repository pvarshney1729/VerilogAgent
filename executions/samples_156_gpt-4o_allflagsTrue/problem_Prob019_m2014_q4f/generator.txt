<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with two 1-bit inputs (`in1` and `in2`) and one 1-bit output (`out`). The circuit requires an AND gate where the second input (`in2`) is inverted before being fed into the gate. This means we need to perform a NOT operation on `in2` and then AND the result with `in1`. The guidelines specify using `logic` for port declarations and using an `assign` statement for combinational logic, which is appropriate here since we are not using any sequential logic or flip-flops. The module is purely combinational, so no clock or reset signals are involved.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic in1,
    input  logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Perform NOT operation on in2 and then AND with in1
    assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
