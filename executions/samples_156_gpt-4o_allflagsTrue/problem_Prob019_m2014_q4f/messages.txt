Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: `in1` (1-bit, unsigned)\n- Input: `in2` (1-bit, unsigned)\n- Output: `out` (1-bit, unsigned)\n\nCircuit Description:\n- The module implements a logic circuit where the two inputs `in1` and `in2` are processed through an AND gate.\n- The input `in2` is inverted before entering the AND gate. This is equivalent to saying that `in2` is first passed through a NOT gate (indicated by the \"bubble\" on in2).\n- The logical operation performed by the circuit can be mathematically expressed as `out = in1 AND NOT(in2)`.\n\nAdditional Details:\n- All operations are combinational, with no clock or reset signals involved.\n- The module operates purely on the current values of `in1` and `in2`. There are no sequential elements, and hence, no initial values or clock cycle dependencies to define.\n- The output `out` is immediately responsive to changes in the input signals `in1` and `in2`.\n\nBit Conventions:\n- The least significant bit (LSB) is referred to as bit[0] for all inputs and outputs.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The circuit will handle all possible binary combinations of `in1` and `in2` (00, 01, 10, 11) without any undefined behavior.\n                    "
