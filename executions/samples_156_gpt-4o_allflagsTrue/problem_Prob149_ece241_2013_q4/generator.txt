<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a state machine that reacts to the water level sensor inputs `s[2:0]`. The module has a synchronous reset that initializes the system to a state where all flow rate outputs are asserted, simulating a low water level condition. The state machine transitions between four states based on the sensor inputs, and the outputs are determined by both the current state and the previous state to control the supplemental flow valve (`dfr`). The logic is implemented using an always block sensitive to the clock for sequential logic, and another always block for combinational logic to determine the next state based on the current sensor inputs.
