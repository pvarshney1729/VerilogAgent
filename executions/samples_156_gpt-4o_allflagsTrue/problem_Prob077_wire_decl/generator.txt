<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specification by using combinational logic to create the desired circuit. The module has four inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and two outputs (`out`, `out_n`). The circuit is composed of two layers:

1. **First Layer (AND Gates):** 
   - Two intermediate signals (`and1_out` and `and2_out`) are declared to hold the outputs of the AND gates.
   - The first AND gate takes inputs `a` and `b`, and its output is stored in `and1_out`.
   - The second AND gate takes inputs `c` and `d`, and its output is stored in `and2_out`.

2. **Second Layer (OR Gate):**
   - The OR gate takes the outputs of the two AND gates (`and1_out` and `and2_out`) and produces the `out` signal.

3. **Inversion:**
   - The `out_n` signal is the logical NOT of the `out` signal, providing the inverted output.

The design adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all ports and signals, and `assign` statements for combinational logic. This ensures that the module is synthesizable and follows best practices for Verilog coding.
