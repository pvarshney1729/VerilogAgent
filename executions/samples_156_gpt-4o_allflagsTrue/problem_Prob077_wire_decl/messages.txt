Intermediate Signal Definitions:\n   - `wire and1_out` : Output of the AND gate connected to inputs `a` and `b`.\n   - `wire and2_out` : Output of the AND gate connected to inputs `c` and `d`.\n\n2. Layer 1 - AND Gates:\n   - `and1_out = a AND b` : Connect inputs `a` and `b` to the first AND gate.\n   - `and2_out = c AND d` : Connect inputs `c` and `d` to the second AND gate.\n\n3.

Inversion:\n   - `out_n = NOT out` : The output `out_n` is the inverted value of `out`.\n\nDesign Considerations:\n- Ensure that each wire is driven by only one source and can fan out to multiple inputs.\n- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals, and no additional signal width specifications are required.\n- The implementation is purely combinational logic with no sequential elements or timing considerations.\n- Ensure correct logic operation under all input combinations.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The implementation must function correctly for all 16 possible input combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.\n- The output `out` will be high if either pair of inputs (`a AND b` or `c AND d`) is high, otherwise it will be low.\n- The output `out_n` will always be the logical complement of `out`.\n                    "

The task involves creating a combinational logic circuit using AND, OR, and NOT gates. The module has four inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and two outputs (`out`, `out_n`). The circuit is structured in two layers: the first layer consists of two AND gates, and the second layer consists of an OR gate and a NOT gate.\n\n1. **Port Declaration**: We declare all inputs and outputs as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions. This allows us to use these signals in both combinational and sequential logic if needed.\n\n2. **Intermediate Wires**: We declare two intermediate `logic` signals (`and1_out` and `and2_out`) to hold the outputs of the AND gates. This is necessary to connect the outputs of the first layer to the inputs of the OR gate in the second layer.\n\n3. **AND Gates**: We use two AND gates to perform bitwise AND operations on the input pairs (`a & b` and `c & d`). The results are stored in `and1_out` and `and2_out`.\n\n4. **OR Gate**: The outputs of the two AND gates are fed into an OR gate. The result of this OR operation is assigned to the output `out`.\n\n5. **NOT Gate**: The output `out` is inverted using a NOT operation to produce `out_n`.\n\n6. **Combinational Logic**: Since this is purely combinational logic, we use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) instead of `always` blocks. This ensures that the outputs are always updated based on the current inputs.\n\n7. **No Synchronous Reset**: The guidelines mention synchronous reset, but since this is a purely combinational circuit, there is no need for a reset signal or clock.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the module is implemented correctly according to the specification and adheres to the provided coding conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic a,\n    input logic b,\n    input logic c,\n    input logic d,\n    output logic out,\n    output logic out_n\n);\n\n    // Intermediate wires for AND gate outputs\n    logic and1_out;\n    logic and2_out;\n\n    // First layer: AND gates\n    assign and1_out = a & b;\n    assign and2_out = c & d;\n\n    // Second layer: OR gate\n    assign out = and1_out | and2_out;\n\n    // Inverted output\n    assign out_n = ~out;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The circuit is composed of two layers:\n\n1. **First Layer (AND Gates):** \n   - Two intermediate signals (`and1_out` and `and2_out`) are declared to hold the outputs of the AND gates.\n   - The first AND gate takes inputs `a` and `b`, and its output is stored in `and1_out`.\n   - The second AND gate takes inputs `c` and `d`, and its output is stored in `and2_out`.\n\n2. **Second Layer (OR Gate):**\n   - The OR gate takes the outputs of the two AND gates (`and1_out` and `and2_out`) and produces the `out` signal.\n\n3. **Inversion:**\n   - The `out_n` signal is the logical NOT of the `out` signal, providing the inverted output.\n\nThe design adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all ports and signals, and `assign` statements for combinational logic. This ensures that the module is synthesizable and follows best practices for Verilog coding.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic a,\n    input logic b,\n    input logic c,\n    input logic d,\n    output logic out,\n    output logic out_n\n);\n\n    // Intermediate wires for AND gate outputs\n    logic and1_out;\n    logic and2_out;\n\n    // First layer: AND gates\n    assign and1_out = a & b;\n    assign and2_out = c & d;\n\n    // Second layer: OR gate\n    assign out = and1_out | and2_out;\n\n    // Inverted output\n    assign out_n = ~out;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
