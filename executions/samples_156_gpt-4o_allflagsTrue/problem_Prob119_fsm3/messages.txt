Resets the FSM to the initial state (State A).\n  - `in`: 1-bit input for state transitions.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output indicating the current state's output value.\n\nState Machine Specifications:\n- Type: Moore State Machine\n- Number of States: 4 (State A, State B, State C, State D)\n- State Encoding: Use binary encoding with the following assignments:\n  - State A: 2'b00\n  - State B: 2'b01\n  - State C: 2'b10\n  - State D: 2'b11\n\n- State Transition Table:\n  - Current State: State A\n    - Next State if in=0: State A\n    - Next State if in=1: State B\n    - Output: 0\n  - Current State: State B\n    - Next State if in=0: State C\n    - Next State if in=1: State B\n    - Output: 0\n  - Current State: State C\n    - Next State if in=0: State A\n    - Next State if in=1: State D\n    - Output: 0\n  - Current State: State D\n    - Next State if in=0: State C\n    - Next State if in=1: State B\n    - Output: 1\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and positive edge-triggered.\n- Upon activation of `areset`, the FSM immediately enters State A regardless of the clock.\n\nClock Behavior:\n- All state transitions and output evaluations occur on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, the FSM initializes to State A, and the output is set to 0.\n\nSignal Considerations:\n- The state transitions are governed solely by the input `in`, with no dependencies on non-specified conditions or signals.\n- The precedence of state transitions follows the table specified above, ensuring no race conditions occur.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Proper handling of any undefined or transient input conditions is not explicitly required beyond specified state transitions.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and conventions provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` is declared with inputs `clk`, `areset`, `in`, and output `out`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **State Encoding**: An enumerated type `state_t` is defined to represent the four states (A, B, C, D) using a 2-bit encoding. This makes the state machine easier to read and maintain.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block is combinational and does not include any clock or reset signals in its sensitivity list, as per the conventions.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: Another `always @(*)` block is used to determine the output `out` based solely on the current state, following the Moore machine model. The output is set according to the state transition table provided.\n\n5. **State Register with Asynchronous Reset**: An `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block is used to update the current state. The asynchronous reset (`areset`) is handled by checking if it is asserted, in which case the state is set to `STATE_A`. Otherwise, the state transitions to `next_state` on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n6. **Default Cases**: Default cases are included in both the state transition and output logic to ensure safe operation and avoid latches in synthesis.\n\nThis implementation strictly follows the provided interface, state transition table, and coding conventions, ensuring a correct and efficient Moore state machine design.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is designed as a Moore state machine with four states, each represented by a 2-bit encoding. The state transitions are determined by the input `in` and are specified in the state transition table. The output is determined solely by the current state, as is characteristic of a Moore machine.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit enumeration, which allows for easy readability and maintenance. The states are defined as `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block is purely combinational and adheres to the coding convention of not explicitly specifying the sensitivity list.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: Another `always @(*)` block is used to determine the output `out` based on the current state. This block is also combinational and follows the Moore machine principle where the output depends only on the current state.\n\n4. **State Register with Asynchronous Reset**: The state register is implemented using an `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. The reset logic ensures that the FSM returns to `STATE_A` when `areset` is asserted, regardless of the clock.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: All ports and signals are declared as `logic`, and numeric constants are properly sized. The asynchronous reset is handled correctly by including it in the sensitivity list of the sequential `always` block.\n\nOverall, the implementation is structured to be clear, maintainable, and compliant with the specified guidelines and conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in == 1'b0) ?
