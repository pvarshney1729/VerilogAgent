Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input. Positive edge-triggered.
  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous reset input. Positive edge-triggered. Resets the FSM to the initial state (State A).
  - `in`: 1-bit input for state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output indicating the current state's output value.

State Machine Specifications:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- Number of States: 4 (State A, State B, State C, State D)
- State Encoding: Use binary encoding with the following assignments:
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

- State Transition Table:
  - Current State: State A
    - Next State if in=0: State A
    - Next State if in=1: State B
    - Output: 0
  - Current State: State B
    - Next State if in=0: State C
    - Next State if in=1: State B
    - Output: 0
  - Current State: State C
    - Next State if in=0: State A
    - Next State if in=1: State D
    - Output: 0
  - Current State: State D
    - Next State if in=0: State C
    - Next State if in=1: State B
    - Output: 1

Reset Behavior:
- The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and positive edge-triggered.
- Upon activation of `areset`, the FSM immediately enters State A regardless of the clock.

Clock Behavior:
- All state transitions and output evaluations occur on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the FSM initializes to State A, and the output is set to 0.

Signal Considerations:
- The state transitions are governed solely by the input `in`, with no dependencies on non-specified conditions or signals.
- The precedence of state transitions follows the table specified above, ensuring no race conditions occur.

Edge Cases:
- Proper handling of any undefined or transient input conditions is not explicitly required beyond specified state transitions.
