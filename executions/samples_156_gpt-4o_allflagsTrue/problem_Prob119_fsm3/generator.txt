The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is designed as a Moore state machine with four states, each represented by a 2-bit encoding. The state transitions are determined by the input `in` and are specified in the state transition table. The output is determined solely by the current state, as is characteristic of a Moore machine.

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit enumeration, which allows for easy readability and maintenance. The states are defined as `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, and `STATE_D`.

2. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block is purely combinational and adheres to the coding convention of not explicitly specifying the sensitivity list.

3. **Output Logic**: Another `always @(*)` block is used to determine the output `out` based on the current state. This block is also combinational and follows the Moore machine principle where the output depends only on the current state.

4. **State Register with Asynchronous Reset**: The state register is implemented using an `always` block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. The reset logic ensures that the FSM returns to `STATE_A` when `areset` is asserted, regardless of the clock.

5. **Coding Conventions**: All ports and signals are declared as `logic`, and numeric constants are properly sized. The asynchronous reset is handled correctly by including it in the sensitivity list of the sequential `always` block.

Overall, the implementation is structured to be clear, maintainable, and compliant with the specified guidelines and conventions.
