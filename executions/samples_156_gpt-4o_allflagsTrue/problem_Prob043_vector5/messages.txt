The module takes five 1-bit input signals: a, b, c, d, and e.\n2. The output 'out' is a 25-bit vector that stores the results of all pairwise comparisons between the inputs.\n3. Each bit in the output vector 'out[i]' (where 0 <= i <= 24) represents the result of a comparison between two bits:\n   - The result is 1 if the compared bits are equal, and 0 otherwise.\n4. The comparisons should be ordered as follows:\n   - out[24] = (a == a)\n   - out[23] = (a == b)\n   - out[22] = (a == c)\n   - out[21] = (a == d)\n   - out[20] = (a == e)\n   - out[19] = (b == a)\n   - out[18] = (b == b)\n   - out[17] = (b == c)\n   - out[16] = (b == d)\n   - out[15] = (b == e)\n   - out[14] = (c == a)\n   - out[13] = (c == b)\n   - out[12] = (c == c)\n   - out[11] = (c == d)\n   - out[10] = (c == e)\n   - out[9]  = (d == a)\n   - out[8]  = (d == b)\n   - out[7]  = (d == c)\n   - out[6]  = (d == d)\n   - out[5]  = (d == e)\n   - out[4]  = (e == a)\n   - out[3]  = (e == b)\n   - out[2]  = (e == c)\n   - out[1]  = (e == d)\n   - out[0]  = (e == e)\n5. Each comparison is performed using the equality operator (==).\n6. This module implements combinational logic; hence, there is no clock or reset involved.\n\nNote: Bit[24] represents the MSB (Most Significant Bit) of the output, whereas bit[0] represents the LSB (Least Significant Bit).\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that takes five 1-bit inputs and outputs a 25-bit vector representing the results of pairwise comparisons between these inputs. Each bit in the output vector should be 1 if the corresponding pair of inputs are equal, and 0 otherwise.\n\n1. **Module Interface**: The module has five 1-bit inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) and one 25-bit output (`out`).\n\n2. **Comparison Logic**: For each pair of inputs, we use the XOR operation followed by a NOT operation to determine equality. The expression `~(x ^ y)` evaluates to 1 if `x` and `y` are equal, and 0 otherwise.\n\n3. **Output Vector Construction**: The output vector `out` is constructed by assigning each bit to the result of a specific pairwise comparison. The order of comparisons follows the specification, starting with `out[24]` for `(a == a)` and ending with `out[0]` for `(e == e)`.\n\n4. **Combinational Logic**: The logic is purely combinational, so we use continuous assignment statements (`assign`) to define the output bits. There is no need for an `always` block since the output is directly derived from the inputs without any state or sequential logic.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all ports and signals, as per the guidelines.
