Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule is a combinational logic circuit that generates a 1-bit output `q` based on the 1-bit inputs `a` and `b`. The output `q` follows specific logic determined by the given truth table.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input logic a` : A 1-bit logic input.\n  - `input logic b` : A 1-bit logic input.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `output logic q` : A 1-bit logic output.\n\nSignal Description and Behavior:\n- The module implements a combinational circuit, meaning the output `q` is determined solely by the current values of the inputs `a` and `b`, without any memory of past inputs.\n- The output `q` is defined as follows based on the truth table provided:\n  - When `a = 0` and `b = 0`, `q = 0`.\n  - When `a = 0` and `b = 1`, `q = 0`.\n  - When `a = 1` and `b = 0`, `q = 0`.\n  - When `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `q = 1`.\n\nOperational Note:\n- The response of the output `q` is immediate with respect to changes in the input signals `a` and `b`, as this is a purely combinational design.\n- The truth table is exhaustive for all possible combinations of `a` and `b`, ensuring that `q` is always deterministically defined.\n\nIndexing Convention:\n- All ports are 1-bit wide, thus no indexing is needed beyond the single bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module is fully specified for all possible input combinations due to the binary nature of inputs `a` and `b`.\n- There are no undefined states or race conditions as the logic is purely combinational and stateless.\n\nThis specification ensures that the implementation of `TopModule` is correct and unambiguous, providing clear guidance for Verilog coding.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
