<REASONING>
The task is to implement a combinational logic circuit based on the given truth table. The truth table indicates that the output `q` should be 1 only when both inputs `a` and `b` are 1. This behavior matches the logical AND operation. Therefore, the module can be implemented using a simple AND gate.

The guidelines and coding conventions specify using `logic` for ports and signals, and using `assign` for combinational logic. Since the circuit is purely combinational, there is no need for an `always` block or a clock signal. The implementation will directly assign the result of the AND operation to the output `q`.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    output logic q
);

    // Implementing the combinational logic using an AND gate
    assign q = a & b;

endmodule
