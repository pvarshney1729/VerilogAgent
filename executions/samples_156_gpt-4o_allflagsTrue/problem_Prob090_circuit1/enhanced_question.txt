Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule is a combinational logic circuit that generates a 1-bit output `q` based on the 1-bit inputs `a` and `b`. The output `q` follows specific logic determined by the given truth table.

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic a` : A 1-bit logic input.
  - `input logic b` : A 1-bit logic input.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `output logic q` : A 1-bit logic output.

Signal Description and Behavior:
- The module implements a combinational circuit, meaning the output `q` is determined solely by the current values of the inputs `a` and `b`, without any memory of past inputs.
- The output `q` is defined as follows based on the truth table provided:
  - When `a = 0` and `b = 0`, `q = 0`.
  - When `a = 0` and `b = 1`, `q = 0`.
  - When `a = 1` and `b = 0`, `q = 0`.
  - When `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `q = 1`.

Operational Note:
- The response of the output `q` is immediate with respect to changes in the input signals `a` and `b`, as this is a purely combinational design.
- The truth table is exhaustive for all possible combinations of `a` and `b`, ensuring that `q` is always deterministically defined.

Indexing Convention:
- All ports are 1-bit wide, thus no indexing is needed beyond the single bit.

Edge Cases:
- The module is fully specified for all possible input combinations due to the binary nature of inputs `a` and `b`.
- There are no undefined states or race conditions as the logic is purely combinational and stateless.

This specification ensures that the implementation of `TopModule` is correct and unambiguous, providing clear guidance for Verilog coding.
