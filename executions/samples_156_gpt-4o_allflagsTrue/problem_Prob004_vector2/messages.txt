Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `in`: A 32-bit wide input vector. The vector is indexed from 0 to 31, where `in[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: A 32-bit wide output vector. The vector is indexed from 0 to 31, where `out[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `out[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module performs a byte-order reversal on the 32-bit input vector `in`. \n- The input vector `in` consists of four 8-bit bytes: \n  - Byte 0: `in[7:0]`\n  - Byte 1: `in[15:8]`\n  - Byte 2: `in[23:16]`\n  - Byte 3: `in[31:24]`\n- The output vector `out` should reverse the order of these bytes:\n  - Byte 3 of `in` becomes Byte 0 of `out`: `out[7:0]` = `in[31:24]`\n  - Byte 2 of `in` becomes Byte 1 of `out`: `out[15:8]` = `in[23:16]`\n  - Byte 1 of `in` becomes Byte 2 of `out`: `out[23:16]` = `in[15:8]`\n  - Byte 0 of `in` becomes Byte 3 of `out`: `out[31:24]` = `in[7:0]`\n\nAdditional Clarifications:\n- This module is purely combinational, meaning there are no clocked elements or state retention within the module.\n- No reset signal is required, as there are no registers or flip-flops in this design.\n- The module operates continuously and produces an output immediately reflective of the current input values.\n                    "
