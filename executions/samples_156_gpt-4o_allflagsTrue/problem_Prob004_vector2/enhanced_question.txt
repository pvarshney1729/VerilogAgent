Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `in`: A 32-bit wide input vector. The vector is indexed from 0 to 31, where `in[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: A 32-bit wide output vector. The vector is indexed from 0 to 31, where `out[31]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `out[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

Functionality:
- The module performs a byte-order reversal on the 32-bit input vector `in`. 
- The input vector `in` consists of four 8-bit bytes: 
  - Byte 0: `in[7:0]`
  - Byte 1: `in[15:8]`
  - Byte 2: `in[23:16]`
  - Byte 3: `in[31:24]`
- The output vector `out` should reverse the order of these bytes:
  - Byte 3 of `in` becomes Byte 0 of `out`: `out[7:0]` = `in[31:24]`
  - Byte 2 of `in` becomes Byte 1 of `out`: `out[15:8]` = `in[23:16]`
  - Byte 1 of `in` becomes Byte 2 of `out`: `out[23:16]` = `in[15:8]`
  - Byte 0 of `in` becomes Byte 3 of `out`: `out[31:24]` = `in[7:0]`

Additional Clarifications:
- This module is purely combinational, meaning there are no clocked elements or state retention within the module.
- No reset signal is required, as there are no registers or flip-flops in this design.
- The module operates continuously and produces an output immediately reflective of the current input values.
