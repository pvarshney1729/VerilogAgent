        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered\n  - load: 1-bit, control signal to load the counter\n  - data: 10-bit, unsigned input, specifies the number of clock cycles for the countdown\n- Output Port:\n  - tc: 1-bit, output signal indicating if the counter has reached zero (terminal count)\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module implements a countdown timer using a down-counter. The timer loads a specified value and counts down to zero, asserting an output signal when it reaches zero.\n\nOperational Details:\n1. Clock and Edge Sensitivity:\n   - All sequential logic is sensitive to the positive edge of the clk signal.\n\n2. Counter Loading and Operation:\n   - When load = 1, the internal 10-bit counter (referred to as 'counter') is synchronously loaded with the value from the data input at the next positive clock edge.\n   - When load = 0, if the counter is non-zero, it decrements by 1 on each positive clock edge.\n   - If the counter reaches 0, it remains at 0 and does not decrement further until a new value is loaded.\n\n3. Output Signal (tc):\n   - The tc output is asserted (logic high) when the counter reaches 0, indicating the end of the countdown.\n   - The tc output remains asserted until the counter is reloaded with a new non-zero value.\n\n4. Initial Conditions:\n   - The internal counter and tc output should be initialized to 0 on reset.\n   - The specification does not define a reset signal, assuming the initial state as described.\n\n5. Signal Conventions:\n   - Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nEdge Cases and Considerations:\n- The load operation can occur at any time, even if the counter is actively counting down.\n- There are no asynchronous resets; assume synchronous behavior with the clock.\n\nNote:\n- The module utilizes a single D flip-flop for its operation, implementing the described functionality through sequential logic.\n                    "

This block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n4. **Load Logic**: Inside the always block, we first check if `load` is high. If it is, we load the `counter` with the value from `data`.\n\n5. **Decrement Logic**: If `load` is low and the `counter` is not zero, we decrement the `counter` by 1.\n\n6. **Terminal Count Logic**: We set the `tc` output to high when the `counter` reaches zero. This is done by comparing the `counter` to zero and assigning the result to `tc`.\n\n7. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using a synchronous always block, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the counter loads and decrements correctly, and the terminal count signal is asserted when the counter reaches zero.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic load,\n    input logic [9:0] data,\n    output logic tc\n);\n\n    logic [9:0] counter;\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (load) begin\n            counter <= data;\n        end else if (counter != 10'b0) begin\n            counter <= counter - 1;\n        end\n        tc <= (counter == 10'b0);\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
