Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal, positive edge-triggered
  - load: 1-bit, control signal to load the counter
  - data: 10-bit, unsigned input, specifies the number of clock cycles for the countdown
- Output Port:
  - tc: 1-bit, output signal indicating if the counter has reached zero (terminal count)

Functional Description:
The module implements a countdown timer using a down-counter. The timer loads a specified value and counts down to zero, asserting an output signal when it reaches zero.

Operational Details:
1. Clock and Edge Sensitivity:
   - All sequential logic is sensitive to the positive edge of the clk signal.

2. Counter Loading and Operation:
   - When load = 1, the internal 10-bit counter (referred to as 'counter') is synchronously loaded with the value from the data input at the next positive clock edge.
   - When load = 0, if the counter is non-zero, it decrements by 1 on each positive clock edge.
   - If the counter reaches 0, it remains at 0 and does not decrement further until a new value is loaded.

3. Output Signal (tc):
   - The tc output is asserted (logic high) when the counter reaches 0, indicating the end of the countdown.
   - The tc output remains asserted until the counter is reloaded with a new non-zero value.

4. Initial Conditions:
   - The internal counter and tc output should be initialized to 0 on reset.
   - The specification does not define a reset signal, assuming the initial state as described.

5. Signal Conventions:
   - Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Edge Cases and Considerations:
- The load operation can occur at any time, even if the counter is actively counting down.
- There are no asynchronous resets; assume synchronous behavior with the clock.

Note:
- The module utilizes a single D flip-flop for its operation, implementing the described functionality through sequential logic.
