<REASONING>
To implement the state machine as specified, we need to define the states and their transitions based on the input `w`. The state machine has six states (A, B, C, D, E, F), and transitions occur based on the value of `w`. The output `z` is determined by the current state, being 1 in states E and F, and 0 otherwise. The state machine should reset to state A when the `reset` signal is asserted. The implementation uses an enumerated type for state representation, which makes the code more readable and maintainable. The state transitions are handled in a combinational always block, while the state updates are handled in a sequential always block triggered by the clock. The output logic is also handled in a combinational always block.
