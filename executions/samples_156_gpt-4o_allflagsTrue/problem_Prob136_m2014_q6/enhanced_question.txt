Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- **Ports**:
  - **Input**: 
    - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit). This signal serves as the timing reference for sequential logic, triggering on the positive edge.
    - `reset`: Active-high reset signal (1 bit). This signal is asynchronous and will initialize all state registers to their default state when asserted.
    - `w`: Input data signal (1 bit). This signal determines the state transitions based on its value.
  - **Output**: 
    - `z`: Output signal (1 bit). This signal represents the output of the state machine, where specific states produce a high output.

State Machine Description:
- **States**: The module implements a state machine with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- **State Encoding**: Each state is encoded as follows:
  - State A: 3'b000
  - State B: 3'b001
  - State C: 3'b010
  - State D: 3'b011
  - State E: 3'b100
  - State F: 3'b101

- **Transitions**: The transitions between states are determined by the input `w`:
  - From State A:
    - If `w` is 0, transition to State B.
    - If `w` is 1, remain in State A.
  - From State B:
    - If `w` is 0, transition to State C.
    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.
  - From State C:
    - If `w` is 0, transition to State E.
    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.
  - From State D:
    - If `w` is 0, transition to State F.
    - If `w` is 1, transition to State A.
  - From State E:
    - If `w` is 0, remain in State E.
    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.
  - From State F:
    - If `w` is 0, transition to State C.
    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.

- **Output Logic**:
  - The output `z` is determined by the current state:
    - `z` is 1 when the state is E or F.
    - `z` is 0 for all other states.

- **Reset Behavior**:
  - On the assertion of `reset`, the state machine transitions to the initial state, State A (3'b000), and the output `z` is set to 0.

- **Clock and Timing**:
  - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
  - Ensure proper synchronization between the `clk` and `reset` signals to avoid metastability.

- **Bit Indexing**:
  - The least significant bit is indexed as bit[0].

Edge Cases:
- Verify functionality for both `w` inputs (0 and 1) at each state transition.
- Ensure the state machine correctly resets to State A upon reset assertion regardless of the current state.
