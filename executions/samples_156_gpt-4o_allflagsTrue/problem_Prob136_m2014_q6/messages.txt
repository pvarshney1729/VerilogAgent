Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- **Ports**:\n  - **Input**: \n    - `clk`: Clock signal (1 bit). This signal serves as the timing reference for sequential logic, triggering on the positive edge.\n    - `reset`: Active-high reset signal (1 bit). This signal is asynchronous and will initialize all state registers to their default state when asserted.\n    - `w`: Input data signal (1 bit). This signal determines the state transitions based on its value.\n  - **Output**: \n    - `z`: Output signal (1 bit). This signal represents the output of the state machine, where specific states produce a high output.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- **States**: The module implements a state machine with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n- **State Encoding**: Each state is encoded as follows:\n  - State A: 3'b000\n  - State B: 3'b001\n  - State C: 3'b010\n  - State D: 3'b011\n  - State E: 3'b100\n  - State F: 3'b101\n\n- **Transitions**: The transitions between states are determined by the input `w`:\n  - From State A:\n    - If `w` is 0, transition to State B.\n    - If `w` is 1, remain in State A.\n  - From State B:\n    - If `w` is 0, transition to State C.\n    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.\n  - From State C:\n    - If `w` is 0, transition to State E.\n    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.\n  - From State D:\n    - If `w` is 0, transition to State F.\n    - If `w` is 1, transition to State A.\n  - From State E:\n    - If `w` is 0, remain in State E.\n    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.\n  - From State F:\n    - If `w` is 0, transition to State C.\n    - If `w` is 1, transition to State D.\n\n- **Output Logic**:\n  - The output `z` is determined by the current state:\n    - `z` is 1 when the state is E or F.\n    - `z` is 0 for all other states.\n\n- **Reset Behavior**:\n  - On the assertion of `reset`, the state machine transitions to the initial state, State A (3'b000), and the output `z` is set to 0.\n\n- **Clock and Timing**:\n  - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n  - Ensure proper synchronization between the `clk` and `reset` signals to avoid metastability.\n\n- **Bit Indexing**:\n  - The least significant bit is indexed as bit[0].\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Verify functionality for both `w` inputs (0 and 1) at each state transition.\n- Ensure the state machine correctly resets to State A upon reset assertion regardless of the current state.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the state machine as specified, I followed these steps:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: I defined an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the states A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each state is encoded using a 3-bit logic vector.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: I implemented the state transition logic using a combinational `always @(*)` block. This block determines the `next_state` based on the current state and the input `w`. The transitions are defined according to the state diagram provided.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic for State Update**: I used a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block to update the `current_state`. This block checks the `reset` signal to initialize the state to A when `reset` is asserted. Otherwise, it updates the `current_state` to `next_state` on each positive clock edge.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: I implemented the output logic in a separate combinational `always @(*)` block. The output `z` is set to 1 when the current state is E or F, and 0 otherwise.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: I adhered to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all ports and signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\n6. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is synchronous, meaning the reset signal is sampled with respect to the clock, and it is not included in the sensitivity list of the sequential block.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the state machine behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output logic.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        A = 3'b000,\n        B = 3'b001,\n        C = 3'b010,\n        D = 3'b011,\n        E = 3'b100,\n        F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            A: next_state = (w == 1'b0) ?
