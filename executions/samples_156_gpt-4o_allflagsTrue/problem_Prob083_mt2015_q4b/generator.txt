<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with inputs `x` and `y`, and output `z`. The behavior of the module is defined by a simulation waveform, which can be translated into a truth table. From the truth table, we can derive the logic expression for `z`. The waveform suggests that `z` is high (1) when both `x` and `y` are low (0) or when both `x` and `y` are high (1). This can be expressed as `z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y)`, which is a simple combinational logic expression. Given the coding conventions, we will use `logic` for port declarations and an `assign` statement for the combinational logic.

module TopModule(
