Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input wire x: Single-bit input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- input wire y: Single-bit input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- output wire z: Single-bit output, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nBehavioral Specification:\nThe output z is a combinational logic function of the inputs x and y, defined by the following truth table derived from the simulation waveform:\n\n| x | y | z |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nDescription:\n- The output z is determined by the logical AND operation between x and y, followed by OR with the inverted x AND inverted y, effectively implementing the expression: z = (x AND y) OR (NOT x AND NOT y).\n- This implies z = 1 when both x and y are 1, or when both are 0. For other combinations, z = 0.\n\nTiming and Edge Cases:\n- This module is purely combinational with no dependence on clock edges or sequential logic elements.\n- Ensure that the input signals x and y have stable values before evaluating the output z to avoid metastability or glitches.\n- The module does not utilize any reset conditions as it is purely combinational.\n\nImplementation Note:\n- There are no flip-flops or state-dependent elements in this module; hence, initial conditions are not applicable.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
