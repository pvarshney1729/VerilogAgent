Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire x: Single-bit input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- input wire y: Single-bit input, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- output wire z: Single-bit output, bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Behavioral Specification:
The output z is a combinational logic function of the inputs x and y, defined by the following truth table derived from the simulation waveform:

| x | y | z |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Description:
- The output z is determined by the logical AND operation between x and y, followed by OR with the inverted x AND inverted y, effectively implementing the expression: z = (x AND y) OR (NOT x AND NOT y).
- This implies z = 1 when both x and y are 1, or when both are 0. For other combinations, z = 0.

Timing and Edge Cases:
- This module is purely combinational with no dependence on clock edges or sequential logic elements.
- Ensure that the input signals x and y have stable values before evaluating the output z to avoid metastability or glitches.
- The module does not utilize any reset conditions as it is purely combinational.

Implementation Note:
- There are no flip-flops or state-dependent elements in this module; hence, initial conditions are not applicable.
