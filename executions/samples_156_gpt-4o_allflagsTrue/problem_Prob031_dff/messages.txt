Positive edge-triggered for sequential logic.\n  - d: 1-bit data input for the D flip-flop.\n- Output:\n  - q: 1-bit data output representing the current state of the D flip-flop.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a single D flip-flop.\n2. The flip-flop is triggered on the rising edge (positive edge) of the 'clk' input.\n3. On each rising edge of 'clk', the value of 'd' is sampled and stored into the flip-flop.\n4. The output 'q' reflects the stored value after the clock edge.\n5. There are no reset conditions specified; the initial state of the flip-flop is assumed undefined at power-up.\n6. The module contains only combinational logic outside the sequential flip-flop operation.\n\nNotes:\n- Ensure there are no logic hazards or race conditions by maintaining proper clocking.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit, which is applicable for all ports as they are single-bit signals.\n- The design assumes continuous operation once powered and clocked, with no explicit initialization or reset signals provided.\n                    "
