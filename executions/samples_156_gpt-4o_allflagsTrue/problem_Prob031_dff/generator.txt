<REASONING>
To implement the requested D flip-flop in Verilog, we need to follow the given specifications and guidelines. The module, named `TopModule`, should have three ports: `clk`, `d`, and `q`, all of which are 1-bit signals. The flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`). 

The guidelines suggest using `logic` for port declarations instead of `wire` or `reg`. Since the flip-flop operation is sequential, we will use an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of `clk`. The output `q` will be updated with the value of `d` at each rising edge of `clk`.

No reset signal is specified, so the flip-flop will not include any reset logic. The initial state of `q` is not defined, as per the specification.

The implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring the `always` block is triggered by `posedge clk` without any additional sensitivity list items.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic clk,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
