Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- Input: 
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. Positive edge-triggered for sequential logic.
  - d: 1-bit data input for the D flip-flop.
- Output:
  - q: 1-bit data output representing the current state of the D flip-flop.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a single D flip-flop.
2. The flip-flop is triggered on the rising edge (positive edge) of the 'clk' input.
3. On each rising edge of 'clk', the value of 'd' is sampled and stored into the flip-flop.
4. The output 'q' reflects the stored value after the clock edge.
5. There are no reset conditions specified; the initial state of the flip-flop is assumed undefined at power-up.
6. The module contains only combinational logic outside the sequential flip-flop operation.

Notes:
- Ensure there are no logic hazards or race conditions by maintaining proper clocking.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit, which is applicable for all ports as they are single-bit signals.
- The design assumes continuous operation once powered and clocked, with no explicit initialization or reset signals provided.
