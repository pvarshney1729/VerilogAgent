<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple 2-input AND gate using Verilog. The module is named `TopModule` and has two 1-bit input ports `a` and `b`, and one 1-bit output port `out`. The output `out` should be the result of the logical AND operation between `a` and `b`.

Since this is a purely combinational logic circuit, there is no need for a clock or reset signal. The guidelines and coding conventions provided suggest using `logic` instead of `wire` or `reg`, and using continuous assignment statements for combinational logic. Therefore, we will use an `assign` statement to implement the AND operation.

The module will be defined with the specified interface, and the AND operation will be implemented using a simple `assign` statement. This approach adheres to the provided guidelines and conventions.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    output logic out
);

    assign out = a & b;

endmodule
