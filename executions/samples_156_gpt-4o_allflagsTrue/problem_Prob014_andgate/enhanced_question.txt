Module Specification: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a` (1 bit): Represents the first operand for the AND operation.
  - `input wire b` (1 bit): Represents the second operand for the AND operation.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out` (1 bit): Represents the result of the AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit that performs a 2-input AND operation.

Signal Conventions:
- All signals are treated as 1-bit wide, unsigned binary values.
- The result `out` is computed as follows:
  - `out = a & b`
  - This operation is purely combinational, with no clock or sequential dependencies.

General Guidelines:
- The module does not involve any sequential elements like flip-flops or registers.
- No reset logic is required as the circuit is purely combinational without any state retention.
- Ensure that the implementation remains free of race conditions, as the operation depends solely on the instantaneous values of `a` and `b`.
- Edge cases are inherently managed by the logical AND operation, as it operates on binary inputs and outputs.

This specification ensures clear understanding and correct implementation of the desired 2-input AND gate functionality.
