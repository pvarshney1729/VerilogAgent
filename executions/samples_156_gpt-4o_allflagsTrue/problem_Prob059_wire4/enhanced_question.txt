Module Name: TopModule

Port Descriptions:
- Inputs:
  - input wire a: A single-bit input signal.
  - input wire b: A single-bit input signal.
  - input wire c: A single-bit input signal.
  
- Outputs:
  - output wire w: A single-bit output signal directly connected to input 'a'.
  - output wire x: A single-bit output signal directly connected to input 'b'.
  - output wire y: A single-bit output signal directly connected to input 'b'.
  - output wire z: A single-bit output signal directly connected to input 'c'.

Behavior:
- The module acts as a set of direct connections (wire assignments) from inputs to outputs without any logic manipulation.
- Signal 'a' is directly connected to output 'w', meaning 'w' will have the same value as 'a' at all times.
- Signal 'b' is directly connected to outputs 'x' and 'y', meaning both 'x' and 'y' will have the same value as 'b' at all times.
- Signal 'c' is directly connected to output 'z', meaning 'z' will have the same value as 'c' at all times.

Additional Notes:
- This module contains only combinational logic with no sequential elements such as flip-flops or registers.
- There are no clock signals or reset signals involved, as the module only implements simple wire connections.
- The inputs and outputs are implicitly assumed to be active high unless otherwise specified.
- There are no edge cases or input boundary conditions to consider, as the module functions as a direct mapping of inputs to outputs.
