<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of a Moore machine with two states, A and B. The module uses an asynchronous reset to initialize the state to B when the `areset` signal is high. The state transitions are defined based on the input `in` and the current state, as per the state diagram provided.

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded as `STATE_A` and `STATE_B` using a typedef enum for clarity and maintainability.

2. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block is combinational and does not depend on the clock.

3. **Sequential Logic with Asynchronous Reset**: An `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block is used to update the current state. The asynchronous reset ensures that the state is set to B immediately when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, consistent with Moore machine behavior. An `always @(*)` block is used to assign the output based on the current state.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero. The use of `always @(*)` for combinational logic ensures that all relevant signals are included in the sensitivity list implicitly.
