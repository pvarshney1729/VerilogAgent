Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal for sequential logic, active on the rising edge.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. When high, the module should reset to its initial state.
  - `input in`: 1-bit input signal to determine state transitions in the Moore machine.
- Output:
  - `output reg out`: 1-bit output signal representing the current state's output value.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states, A and B.
- State Encoding:
  - State A: Outputs `out = 0`
  - State B: Outputs `out = 1`
- State Transition Diagram:
  - From State B, with input `in = 0`, transition to State A.
  - From State B, with input `in = 1`, remain in State B.
  - From State A, with input `in = 0`, transition to State B.
  - From State A, with input `in = 1`, remain in State A.

Reset Behavior:
- The asynchronous reset signal, `areset`, when high, forces the state machine into State B regardless of the clock signal.
- Upon deactivation of the reset (areset goes low), the state machine resumes operation based on the input and clock signals.

Implementation Notes:
- The output `out` is only dependent on the current state, consistent with Moore machine operation.
- Bit Indexing: Each input and output is a single bit, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.
- Initial State: On power-up and after reset, the state machine initializes to State B.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal when not in reset.
- Properly handle all possible input combinations and transitions as per the state diagram.

This specification ensures that the module's behavior is precisely defined for correct Verilog implementation.
