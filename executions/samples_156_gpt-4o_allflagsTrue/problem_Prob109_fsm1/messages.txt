The state machine should reset asynchronously to state B when `areset` is high.

This makes the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: We use a combinational always block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. The transitions are:\n   - From `STATE_B`, if `in` is 0, transition to `STATE_A`; if `in` is 1, remain in `STATE_B`.\n   - From `STATE_A`, if `in` is 0, transition to `STATE_B`; if `in` is 1, remain in `STATE_A`.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic with Asynchronous Reset**: We use a sequential always block sensitive to the rising edge of `clk` and `areset`. If `areset` is high, the state is set to `STATE_B`. Otherwise, the state transitions to `next_state` on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state:\n   - In `STATE_A`, `out` is 0.\n   - In `STATE_B`, `out` is 1.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions, ensuring correct behavior of the Moore machine.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [0:0] {STATE_A = 1'b0, STATE_B = 1'b1} state_t;\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (in)\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                if (in)\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to state B\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Sequential logic with asynchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_B; // Reset to state B\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: out = 1'b0;\n            STATE_B: out = 1'b1;\n            default: out = 1'b0; // Default case to handle unexpected states\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of a Moore machine with two states, A and B. The module uses an asynchronous reset to initialize the state to B when the `areset` signal is high. The state transitions are defined based on the input `in` and the current state, as per the state diagram provided.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded as `STATE_A` and `STATE_B` using a typedef enum for clarity and maintainability.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block is combinational and does not depend on the clock.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic with Asynchronous Reset**: An `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block is used to update the current state. The asynchronous reset ensures that the state is set to B immediately when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state, consistent with Moore machine behavior. An `always @(*)` block is used to assign the output based on the current state.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero. The use of `always @(*)` for combinational logic ensures that all relevant signals are included in the sensitivity list implicitly.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [0:0] {STATE_A = 1'b0, STATE_B = 1'b1} state_t;\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (in)\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n            end\n            STATE_B: begin\n                if (in)\n                    next_state = STATE_B;\n                else\n                    next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            default: next_state = STATE_B; // Default to state B\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Sequential logic with asynchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_B; // Reset to state B\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: out = 1'b0;\n            STATE_B: out = 1'b1;\n            default: out = 1'b0; // Default case to handle unexpected states\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
