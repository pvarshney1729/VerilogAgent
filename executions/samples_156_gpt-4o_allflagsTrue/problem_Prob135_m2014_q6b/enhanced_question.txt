Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input:
  - `y`: A 3-bit vector, representing the current state of the finite state machine (FSM). Bit indexing is y[2:0], where y[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `w`: A 1-bit input used to determine state transitions.
- Output:
  - `Y1`: A 1-bit output, directly representing the value of y[1].

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- States are encoded as follows:
  - State A: y = 3'b000
  - State B: y = 3'b001
  - State C: y = 3'b010
  - State D: y = 3'b011
  - State E: y = 3'b100
  - State F: y = 3'b101

- State Transitions:
  - From State A:
    - If w == 0, transition to State B.
    - If w == 1, remain in State A.
  - From State B:
    - If w == 0, transition to State C.
    - If w == 1, transition to State D.
  - From State C:
    - If w == 0, transition to State E.
    - If w == 1, transition to State D.
  - From State D:
    - If w == 0, transition to State F.
    - If w == 1, transition to State A.
  - From State E:
    - If w == 0, remain in State E.
    - If w == 1, transition to State D.
  - From State F:
    - If w == 0, transition to State C.
    - If w == 1, transition to State D.

Implementation Details:
- The FSM uses three D-type flip-flops to store the current state, encoded in `y[2:0]`.
- Flip-flops are clocked on the rising edge of a system clock (not explicitly defined here).
- Reset behavior:
  - The specification does not define a reset input; hence, assume the module starts from an undefined state unless specified in the actual implementation.
- Output `Y1` is directly assigned to `y[1]`, reflecting the FSM's second state bit.

Note:
- This specification focuses on defining the next-state logic and the output logic related to `y[1]` as requested.
- Ensure that the state transitions and output logic are implemented correctly and verified against the specified FSM behavior.
