Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk (1-bit): Clock signal, used to trigger sequential logic on its positive edge.\n  - a (1-bit): Data input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q (1-bit): Output signal that changes state based on the input signal 'a' and clock edges.\n\nOperational Description:\n- This is a sequential circuit, where the behavior is defined by clock cycles and the input signal 'a'.\n- The output 'q' is initially undefined and transitions to a known state based on the input 'a' at each positive edge of the clock.\n\nTiming and Logic Details:\n- At time 0ns, both clk and signals are undefined ('x'). The initial state of 'q' is undefined due to the unspecified behavior at the start.\n- At time 5ns, on the first positive edge of clk, if 'a' is 0, 'q' remains undefined.\n- At time 15ns, with clk at a positive edge and 'a' still 0, 'q' transitions to 1.\n- When 'a' is 0, any subsequent positive clock edges maintain 'q' in state 1.\n- When 'a' transitions to 1, 'q' remains 1 until the next positive edge of clk.\n- On the subsequent positive edge when 'a' is 1 (time 45ns), 'q' transitions to 0.\n- If 'a' remains 1, 'q' will hold at 0 through subsequent positive clock edges.\n\nClock and Reset Details:\n- The circuit operates on the positive edge of the clk signal.\n- No explicit reset is provided or assumed; initial behavior depends on the input sequence.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- The initial state of 'q' is undefined until the first positive clk edge with a valid input 'a'.\n- There is no specified reset state; behavior is determined entirely by the input conditions.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The behavior is undefined if the input 'a' changes values other than at positive clock edges.\n- Ensure stable inputs at each positive clock edge to prevent race conditions.\n\nThe provided waveform demonstrates a toggle behavior of 'q' controlled by the input 'a' at each positive clock edge.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe task is to implement a sequential circuit based on the provided waveform. The circuit should toggle the output `q` based on the input `a` at each positive edge of the clock `clk`.\n\n1. **Initial State**: The waveform starts with `q` undefined. The first positive edge of `clk` with `a` being `0` does not define `q`. However, at the next positive edge with `a` still `0`, `q` becomes `1`.\n\n2. **Behavior with `a = 0`**: When `a` is `0`, `q` should be set to `1` at the positive edge of `clk`. This is consistent with the waveform where `q` remains `1` as long as `a` is `0`.\n\n3. **Behavior with `a = 1`**: When `a` is `1`, `q` should toggle to `0` at the positive edge of `clk`. This is seen in the waveform where `q` transitions to `0` when `a` is `1` at the positive edge of `clk`.\n\n4. **Sequential Logic**: The circuit is sequential, meaning it updates its state on the positive edge of the clock. The logic is implemented using an `always` block triggered by `posedge clk`.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The output `q` is determined by the value of `a` at each clock edge. If `a` is `1`, `q` is set to `0`. If `a` is `0`, `q` is set to `1`.\n\nThe implementation uses a simple `always` block with a conditional statement to set `q` based on the value of `a` at each positive clock edge.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic a,\n    output logic q\n);\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (a == 1'b1) begin\n            q <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            q <= 1'b1;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
