<REASONING>
The task is to implement a sequential circuit based on the provided waveform. The circuit should toggle the output `q` based on the input `a` at each positive edge of the clock `clk`.

1. **Initial State**: The waveform starts with `q` undefined. The first positive edge of `clk` with `a` being `0` does not define `q`. However, at the next positive edge with `a` still `0`, `q` becomes `1`.

2. **Behavior with `a = 0`**: When `a` is `0`, `q` should be set to `1` at the positive edge of `clk`. This is consistent with the waveform where `q` remains `1` as long as `a` is `0`.

3. **Behavior with `a = 1`**: When `a` is `1`, `q` should toggle to `0` at the positive edge of `clk`. This is seen in the waveform where `q` transitions to `0` when `a` is `1` at the positive edge of `clk`.

4. **Sequential Logic**: The circuit is sequential, meaning it updates its state on the positive edge of the clock. The logic is implemented using an `always` block triggered by `posedge clk`.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `q` is determined by the value of `a` at each clock edge. If `a` is `1`, `q` is set to `0`. If `a` is `0`, `q` is set to `1`.

The implementation uses a simple `always` block with a conditional statement to set `q` based on the value of `a` at each positive clock edge.
