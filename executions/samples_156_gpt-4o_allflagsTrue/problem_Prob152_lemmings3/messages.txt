In the\nLemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left\n(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch\ndirections if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped\non the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's\nbumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.\nIf it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch\ndirections.\n\nIn addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,\nwhen ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"aaah!\". When the ground\nreappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same\ndirection as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect\nthe walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground\ndisappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while\nstill falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n\nIn addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do\nuseful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig\nif it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will\ncontinue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that\npoint, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue\nwalking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with\nfalling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig\nwhen falling or when there is no ground is ignored.

The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) with four states: `WALK_LEFT`, `WALK_RIGHT`, `FALLING`, and `DIGGING`. The state transitions are determined by the inputs `bump_left`, `bump_right`, `ground`, and `dig`, with precedence given to falling, then digging, and finally direction switching.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 2-bit logic vector, allowing for four distinct states.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The `always @(*)` block defines the next state based on the current state and inputs:\n   - From `WALK_LEFT`, the Lemming transitions to `FALLING` if `ground` is 0, to `DIGGING` if `dig` is 1 and `ground` is 1, or to `WALK_RIGHT` if `bump_left` is 1.\n   - From `WALK_RIGHT`, similar logic applies, with transitions to `FALLING`, `DIGGING`, or `WALK_LEFT` based on inputs.\n   - From `FALLING`, the Lemming returns to the previous walking state when `ground` is 1.\n   - From `DIGGING`, the Lemming transitions to `FALLING` if `ground` becomes 0.\n\n3. **State Update Logic**: The `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock or asynchronously resets to `WALK_LEFT` when `areset` is high.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The outputs `walk_left`, `walk_right`, `aaah`, and `digging` are determined solely by the current state, consistent with a Moore machine.\n\nThis design ensures that the Lemming's behavior adheres to the specified rules, with correct precedence handling and asynchronous reset functionality.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic bump_left,\n    input logic bump_right,\n    input logic ground,\n    input logic dig,\n    output logic walk_left,\n    output logic walk_right,\n    output logic aaah,\n    output logic digging\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        WALK_LEFT  = 2'b00,\n        WALK_RIGHT = 2'b01,\n        FALLING    = 2'b10,\n        DIGGING    = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            WALK_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALLING;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIGGING;\n                else if (bump_left)\n                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n                else\n                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n            end\n            WALK_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALLING;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIGGING;\n                else if (bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n                else\n                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n            end\n            FALLING: begin\n                if (ground)\n                    next_state = (state == WALK_LEFT) ?

The FSM transitions between these states based on the input signals: bump_left, bump_right, ground, and dig. The state transitions are governed by the following rules:\n\n1. **WALK_LEFT State**:\n   - Transition to FALLING if ground is 0.\n   - Transition to DIGGING if dig is 1 and ground is 1.\n   - Transition to WALK_RIGHT if bump_left is 1.\n   - Remain in WALK_LEFT otherwise.\n\n2. **WALK_RIGHT State**:\n   - Transition to FALLING if ground is 0.\n   - Transition to DIGGING if dig is 1 and ground is 1.\n   - Transition to WALK_LEFT if bump_right is 1.\n   - Remain in WALK_RIGHT otherwise.\n\n3. **FALLING State**:\n   - Remain in FALLING if ground is 0.\n   - Return to the previous walking state (either WALK_LEFT or WALK_RIGHT) when ground is 1.\n\n4. **DIGGING State**:\n   - Transition to FALLING if ground is 0.\n   - Remain in DIGGING if ground is 1.\n\nThe outputs are determined by the current state:\n- walk_left is high when in WALK_LEFT state.\n- walk_right is high when in WALK_RIGHT state.\n- aaah is high when in FALLING state.\n- digging is high when in DIGGING state.\n\nThe FSM is reset asynchronously to the WALK_LEFT state when areset is high. All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic bump_left,\n    input logic bump_right,\n    input logic ground,\n    input logic dig,\n    output logic walk_left,\n    output logic walk_right,\n    output logic aaah,\n    output logic digging\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        WALK_LEFT  = 2'b00,\n        WALK_RIGHT = 2'b01,\n        FALLING    = 2'b10,\n        DIGGING    = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            WALK_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALLING;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIGGING;\n                else if (bump_left)\n                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n                else\n                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n            end\n            WALK_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALLING;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIGGING;\n                else if (bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n                else\n                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n            end\n            FALLING: begin\n                if (ground)\n                    next_state = (state == WALK_LEFT) ?
