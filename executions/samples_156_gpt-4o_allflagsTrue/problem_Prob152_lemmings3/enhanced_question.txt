Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered for all sequential logic.
- input wire areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active high, resets the system to initial state.
- input wire bump_left: Input signal indicating a bump on the left.
- input wire bump_right: Input signal indicating a bump on the right.
- input wire ground: Input signal indicating presence of ground (1) or absence (0).
- input wire dig: Input signal to initiate digging.
- output reg walk_left: Output signal, high when Lemming is walking left.
- output reg walk_right: Output signal, high when Lemming is walking right.
- output reg aaah: Output signal, high when Lemming is falling.
- output reg digging: Output signal, high when Lemming is digging.

Signal Conventions:
- All signals are 1-bit wide.
- bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Design:
- The FSM is a Moore machine, where outputs depend only on the current state.
- States include: WALK_LEFT, WALK_RIGHT, FALLING, and DIGGING.
- Initial state after reset: WALK_LEFT.

State Transition Logic:
1. WALK_LEFT:
   - Transitions to WALK_RIGHT if bump_left is 1.
   - Transitions to FALLING if ground is 0.
   - Transitions to DIGGING if dig is 1 and ground is 1.

2. WALK_RIGHT:
   - Transitions to WALK_LEFT if bump_right is 1.
   - Transitions to FALLING if ground is 0.
   - Transitions to DIGGING if dig is 1 and ground is 1.

3. FALLING:
   - Remains in FALLING while ground is 0.
   - Returns to previous walking state (either WALK_LEFT or WALK_RIGHT) when ground is 1.

4. DIGGING:
   - Continues in DIGGING until ground is 0, transitioning to FALLING.
   - Previous walking direction is resumed when ground reappears.

Precedence of Operations:
- Falling (aaah) has the highest precedence.
- Digging has higher precedence than switching directions.
- Direction switch occurs if neither falling nor digging conditions are met.

Reset Behavior:
- On areset (active high), return to initial state WALK_LEFT regardless of current state.

Edge Cases:
- If bumps occur on both sides at the same time, direction switches.
- If ground disappears and bumps occur simultaneously, falling takes precedence, and bumps do not affect direction.
- If dig is asserted while falling or when no ground is present, it is ignored.

Clock and Reset:
- All state transitions occur on the positive edge of clk.
- Areset is asynchronous and resets the FSM to WALK_LEFT immediately when active.
