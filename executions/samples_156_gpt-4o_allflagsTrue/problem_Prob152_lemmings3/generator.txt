To implement the Lemming's behavior as described, we need to create a finite state machine (FSM) with four states: WALK_LEFT, WALK_RIGHT, FALLING, and DIGGING. The FSM transitions between these states based on the input signals: bump_left, bump_right, ground, and dig. The state transitions are governed by the following rules:

1. **WALK_LEFT State**:
   - Transition to FALLING if ground is 0.
   - Transition to DIGGING if dig is 1 and ground is 1.
   - Transition to WALK_RIGHT if bump_left is 1.
   - Remain in WALK_LEFT otherwise.

2. **WALK_RIGHT State**:
   - Transition to FALLING if ground is 0.
   - Transition to DIGGING if dig is 1 and ground is 1.
   - Transition to WALK_LEFT if bump_right is 1.
   - Remain in WALK_RIGHT otherwise.

3. **FALLING State**:
   - Remain in FALLING if ground is 0.
   - Return to the previous walking state (either WALK_LEFT or WALK_RIGHT) when ground is 1.

4. **DIGGING State**:
   - Transition to FALLING if ground is 0.
   - Remain in DIGGING if ground is 1.

The outputs are determined by the current state:
- walk_left is high when in WALK_LEFT state.
- walk_right is high when in WALK_RIGHT state.
- aaah is high when in FALLING state.
- digging is high when in DIGGING state.

The FSM is reset asynchronously to the WALK_LEFT state when areset is high. All state transitions occur on the positive edge of the clock.
