Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire d`: Data input (1 bit, refers to the data to be latched).
  - `input wire ena`: Enable signal (1 bit, controls whether the data input is latched).

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg q`: Latched output (1 bit, holds the latched data).

Functional Description:
- The module implements a D latch using an always block.
- The latch operation is controlled by the `ena` signal:
  - When `ena` is high (`1`), the output `q` will latch the value of the input `d`.
  - When `ena` is low (`0`), the output `q` retains its previous state.

Operational Details:
- The latch is level-sensitive and operates asynchronously with respect to any clock signal.
- The latch does not have a reset signal; hence, the initial state of `q` is undefined until the first latch operation occurs.

Bit Conventions:
- All bit positions are indexed from 0, with `bit[0]` referring to the least significant bit.

Timing Considerations:
- Ensure that `d` is stable when `ena` is asserted to avoid indeterminate states at the output `q`.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that `ena` is not fluctuating rapidly during the operation to prevent race conditions or glitches in the output `q`.

Note: This specification assumes that the latch operates solely based on the `ena` signal and does not incorporate any additional clock-related logic.
