<REASONING>
To implement the D latch, we need to follow the given guidelines and coding conventions. The module should have a simple interface with inputs `d` and `ena`, and an output `q`. The D latch will be implemented using an always block that is sensitive to changes in the inputs. Since the latch is level-sensitive, we will use `always @(*)` to ensure that the output `q` is updated whenever there is a change in `d` or `ena`.

The logic inside the always block will check if `ena` is high. If it is, the output `q` will be assigned the value of `d`. If `ena` is low, `q` will retain its previous value. This behavior is typical for a D latch, where the output follows the input when enabled.

We will declare all ports and signals as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions. Since there is no reset signal specified, we will not implement any reset logic. The initial state of `q` is undefined until the first latch operation occurs.

The implementation will strictly follow the provided interface and signal names, ensuring that the module operates correctly as a D latch.
