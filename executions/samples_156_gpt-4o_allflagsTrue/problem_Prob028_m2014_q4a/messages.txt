Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire d`: Data input (1 bit, refers to the data to be latched).\n  - `input wire ena`: Enable signal (1 bit, controls whether the data input is latched).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg q`: Latched output (1 bit, holds the latched data).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a D latch using an always block.\n- The latch operation is controlled by the `ena` signal:\n  - When `ena` is high (`1`), the output `q` will latch the value of the input `d`.\n  - When `ena` is low (`0`), the output `q` retains its previous state.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The latch is level-sensitive and operates asynchronously with respect to any clock signal.\n- The latch does not have a reset signal; hence, the initial state of `q` is undefined until the first latch operation occurs.\n\nBit Conventions:\n- All bit positions are indexed from 0, with `bit[0]` referring to the least significant bit.\n\nTiming Considerations:\n- Ensure that `d` is stable when `ena` is asserted to avoid indeterminate states at the output `q`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that `ena` is not fluctuating rapidly during the operation to prevent race conditions or glitches in the output `q`.\n\nNote: This specification assumes that the latch operates solely based on the `ena` signal and does not incorporate any additional clock-related logic.\n                    "
