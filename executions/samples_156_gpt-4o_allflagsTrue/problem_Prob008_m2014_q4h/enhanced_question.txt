Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input wire in: A single-bit input signal (bit[0] refers to the least significant bit).
- output wire out: A single-bit output signal.

Functional Specification:
- The TopModule is designed to perform a simple combinational logic operation.
- The output port 'out' shall be directly assigned the value of the input port 'in'.
- This assignment must be performed combinationally, meaning there is no dependency on clock cycles or any sequential logic elements such as flip-flops or registers.

Additional Clarifications:
- As this module is purely combinational, there are no clock or reset signals involved.
- There are no initial conditions or states to define since the module does not contain any sequential logic.
- The module operates continuously as long as it is powered, reflecting any changes in the input 'in' immediately to 'out'.
- There are no special cases or edge conditions beyond the standard behavior described, as the module's function is a direct pass-through of the input to the output.
