<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple combinational logic module named `TopModule` that directly assigns the input `in` to the output `out`. The guidelines and coding conventions provided are more relevant to more complex designs involving sequential logic, synchronous resets, and always blocks. However, since this is a purely combinational logic task, these guidelines are not directly applicable. 

The module requires no clock or reset signals, as it is a simple pass-through of the input to the output. The use of `assign` is appropriate here because it directly reflects the combinational nature of the task. The ports will be declared using the `logic` type to adhere to the coding conventions, although in this simple case, `wire` would also be appropriate. 

The implementation will strictly follow the interface specification, ensuring that the input and output are one bit each. The `assign` statement will be used to connect the input to the output.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic in,
    output logic out
);

    // Combinational assignment
    assign out = in;
