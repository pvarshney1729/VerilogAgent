The implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to meet the specified requirements. The module is designed as a finite state machine (FSM) with several states to handle the detection of the input pattern `1101`, loading the delay value, counting the specified number of clock cycles, and waiting for acknowledgment from the user.

1. **State Definitions**: The FSM is defined with the following states:
   - `IDLE`: The initial state where the module searches for the pattern `1101`.
   - `PATTERN_DETECT`: This state is used to detect the pattern `1101`.
   - `LOAD_DELAY`: After detecting the pattern, the module shifts in the next 4 bits to determine the delay.
   - `COUNTING`: The module counts for `(delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000` clock cycles.
   - `WAIT_ACK`: After counting, the module asserts `done` and waits for the `ack` signal.

2. **Pattern Detection**: The `pattern_shift_reg` is used to shift in the serial data and detect the pattern `1101`. Once detected, the FSM transitions to the `LOAD_DELAY` state.

3. **Delay Loading**: In the `LOAD_DELAY` state, the module shifts in the next 4 bits to determine the delay value. The `delay_shift_reg` is used for this purpose.

4. **Counting**: In the `COUNTING` state, the module counts down from `(delay + 1) * 1000` using the `cycle_counter`. The `count` output reflects the current remaining time, which is derived from the most significant bits of the `cycle_counter`.

5. **Waiting for Acknowledgment**: Once counting is complete, the module transitions to the `WAIT_ACK` state, asserts the `done` signal, and waits for the `ack` signal to reset and start searching for the pattern again.

6. **Synchronous Reset**: The module uses a synchronous reset to initialize the FSM to the `IDLE` state.

The implementation adheres to the coding conventions and guidelines provided, ensuring correct signal declarations, state transitions, and output logic.
