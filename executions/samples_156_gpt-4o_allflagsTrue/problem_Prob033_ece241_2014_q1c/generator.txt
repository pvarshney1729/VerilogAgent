<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers and detects signed overflow. The module has two 8-bit inputs `a` and `b`, an 8-bit output `s` for the sum, and a 1-bit output `overflow` to indicate if a signed overflow occurs.

1. **Addition Logic**: The sum of `a` and `b` is straightforward using the `+` operator. The result is assigned to `s`.

2. **Overflow Detection**: Signed overflow occurs when the sign of the result differs from the expected sign based on the inputs. Specifically:
   - If both `a` and `b` are positive (a[7] = 0, b[7] = 0) and the result `s` is negative (s[7] = 1), overflow occurs.
   - If both `a` and `b` are negative (a[7] = 1, b[7] = 1) and the result `s` is positive (s[7] = 0), overflow occurs.
   - This is captured by the expression: `(a[7] & b[7] & ~s[7]) | (~a[7] & ~b[7] & s[7])`.

3. **Coding Conventions**: 
   - Use `logic` for port declarations as per the guidelines.
   - Use `assign` statements for combinational logic.
   - Ensure all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

The module is purely combinational and does not require a clock or reset signal.
