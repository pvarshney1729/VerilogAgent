Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `a`: 8-bit input vector, representing a 2's complement number. Bit index 7 is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit index 0 is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `b`: 8-bit input vector, representing a 2's complement number. Bit index 7 is the MSB, and bit index 0 is the LSB.

- Output Ports:
  - `s`: 8-bit output vector, representing the 2's complement sum of inputs `a` and `b`. Bit index 7 is the MSB, and bit index 0 is the LSB.
  - `overflow`: 1-bit output that indicates if a signed overflow has occurred during the addition of `a` and `b`.

Functional Description:
- The module performs an addition of two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, `a` and `b`.
- The result of the addition is stored in the output `s`.

Signed Overflow Detection:
- Signed overflow occurs if:
  - The sign bit of `a` (a[7]) and the sign bit of `b` (b[7]) are the same, and
  - The sign bit of the result `s` (s[7]) differs from the sign bits of `a` and `b`.
- The `overflow` output is set to `1` if a signed overflow is detected; otherwise, it is set to `0`.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Ensure correct handling of edge cases, such as when `a` and/or `b` are at their maximum or minimum 2's complement values.
- The behavior is well-defined for all possible input combinations of `a` and `b`.

Clock and Reset:
- This module is purely combinational and does not involve any clock or reset signals.

Dependencies:
- The output `s` and `overflow` are directly dependent on the inputs `a` and `b` and should reflect changes immediately.
