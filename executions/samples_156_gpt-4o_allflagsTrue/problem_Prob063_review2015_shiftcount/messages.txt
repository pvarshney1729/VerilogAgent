Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, triggers sequential logic on the positive edge.\n  - `input shift_ena`: Control signal to enable shifting of data into the register.\n  - `input count_ena`: Control signal to enable decrementing of the register value.\n  - `input data`: Serial data input for shifting, interpreted as 1-bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output [3:0] q`: Four-bit output representing the current state of the shift register.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module functions as a four-bit shift register and down counter.\n- The register shifts data in from the `data` input when `shift_ena` is high (1).\n  - Data is shifted in with the most significant bit (MSB) first.\n  - The shifting operation occurs on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`).\n\n- When `count_ena` is high (1), the current value in the register is decremented by 1.\n  - The decrement operation occurs on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`).\n\n- The module is not required to handle the scenario when both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are high simultaneously. The behavior in this condition is undefined, and no priority is assigned to either operation in this case.\n\n- Initial State:\n  - On reset, the shift register should be initialized to a value of 4'b0000.\n\nAdditional Specifications:\n- Bit Indexing: `q[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB), and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Reset Condition: The module does not specify an explicit reset input; thus, initial conditions are assumed to be managed externally or through other means in a larger system context.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The behavior of the module should be robust against overflow when counting down from 4'b0000. In such cases, the register should wrap around to 4'b1111.\n- The shift operation will treat the most significant input bit as `data` when shifting.\n                    "
