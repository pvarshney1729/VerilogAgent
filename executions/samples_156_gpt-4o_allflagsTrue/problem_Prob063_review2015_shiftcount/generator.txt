<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` is based on the requirements to create a four-bit shift register that can also act as a down counter. The module uses a single always block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`). This ensures that all operations are synchronized with the clock.

1. **Shift Register Functionality**: When `shift_ena` is high, the module shifts the current contents of the register `q` to the left by one bit and inserts the new data bit at the least significant bit (LSB) position. This is achieved using the concatenation operator `{}`.

2. **Down Counter Functionality**: When `count_ena` is high, the module decrements the current value of the register `q` by 1. This is done using the subtraction operation.

3. **Undefined Behavior Handling**: The specification states that the behavior is undefined when both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are high simultaneously. The implementation prioritizes the shift operation over the count operation, but this is arbitrary since the behavior is unspecified.

4. **Signal Declaration**: All signals are declared using `logic` as per the coding conventions, which avoids the use of `wire` or `reg`.

5. **Sequential Logic**: The use of `always_ff` ensures that the block is recognized as sequential logic, which is appropriate for operations that depend on the clock edge.

6. **No Explicit Reset**: The specification does not mention a reset signal, so the module does not include one. Initial conditions are assumed to be managed externally.

The implementation adheres to the provided interface and coding conventions, ensuring correct bitwise operations and signal handling.
