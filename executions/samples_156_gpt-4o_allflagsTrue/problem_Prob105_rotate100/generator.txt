<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a 100-bit rotator with specific functionalities based on the input signals. The module has a clock input `clk`, a load signal `load`, a 2-bit enable signal `ena`, a 100-bit data input `data`, and a 100-bit output `q`. The behavior of the module is as follows:

1. **Load Operation**: When the `load` signal is high, the module should load the `data` input into the output `q`. This operation is synchronous with the clock.

2. **Rotation Operation**: If the `load` signal is not asserted, the module should perform a rotation based on the `ena` signal:
   - `ena = 2'b01`: Rotate the bits in `q` to the right by one position. The bit shifted out from the right end should be shifted back into the left end.
   - `ena = 2'b10`: Rotate the bits in `q` to the left by one position. The bit shifted out from the left end should be shifted back into the right end.
   - `ena = 2'b00` or `ena = 2'b11`: No rotation should occur, and the output `q` should remain unchanged.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The module uses an `always_ff` block triggered on the rising edge of the clock to ensure synchronous operation.
   - The `case` statement is used to handle the different values of `ena` and apply the appropriate rotation or maintain the current state.
   - The `logic` data type is used for all signals to adhere to modern Verilog conventions.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module behaves as specified, with correct handling of loading and rotating operations.
