Implement a\nmodule with the same functionality as the 7458 chip. It has 10 inputs and\n2 outputs. You may choose to use an `assign` statement to drive each of\nthe output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as\nintermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of\none of the AND gates.\n\nIn this circuit, p1y should be the OR of two 3-input AND gates: one that\nANDs p1a, p1b, and p1c, and the second that ANDs p1d, p1e, and p1f. The\noutput p2y is the OR of two 2-input AND gates: one that ANDs p2a and p2b,\nand the second that ANDs p2c and p2d.\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of the 7458 chip, which consists of four AND gates and two OR gates. The module is designed to take 10 single-bit inputs and produce 2 single-bit outputs. The outputs are determined by the logical operations specified:\n\n1. **p1y Output**: \n   - This is the result of an OR operation between two 3-input AND gates.\n   - The first AND gate takes inputs `p1a`, `p1b`, and `p1c`.\n   - The second AND gate takes inputs `p1d`, `p1e`, and `p1f`.\n   - The OR operation combines the outputs of these two AND gates to produce `p1y`.\n\n2. **p2y Output**:\n   - This is the result of an OR operation between two 2-input AND gates.\n   - The first AND gate takes inputs `p2a` and `p2b`.\n   - The second AND gate takes inputs `p2c` and `p2d`.\n   - The OR operation combines the outputs of these two AND gates to produce `p2y`.\n\nThe implementation uses `logic` for all ports and intermediate signals, adhering to the coding conventions specified. The use of `assign` statements ensures that the logic is purely combinational, as required by the problem statement.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input  logic p1a,\n    input  logic p1b,\n    input  logic p1c,\n    input  logic p1d,\n    input  logic p1e,\n    input  logic p1f,\n    input  logic p2a,\n    input  logic p2b,\n    input  logic p2c,\n    input  logic p2d,\n    output logic p1y,\n    output logic p2y\n);\n\n    // Intermediate signals for AND gate outputs\n    logic and1_out, and2_out, and3_out, and4_out;\n\n    // 3-input AND gates for p1y\n    assign and1_out = p1a & p1b & p1c;\n    assign and2_out = p1d & p1e & p1f;\n\n    // 2-input AND gates for p2y\n    assign and3_out = p2a & p2b;\n    assign and4_out = p2c & p2d;\n\n    // OR gates for final outputs\n    assign p1y = and1_out | and2_out;\n    assign p2y = and3_out | and4_out;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
