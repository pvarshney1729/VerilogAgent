<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of the 7458 chip, which consists of four AND gates and two OR gates. The module is designed to take 10 single-bit inputs and produce 2 single-bit outputs. The outputs are determined by the logical operations specified:

1. **p1y Output**: 
   - This is the result of an OR operation between two 3-input AND gates.
   - The first AND gate takes inputs `p1a`, `p1b`, and `p1c`.
   - The second AND gate takes inputs `p1d`, `p1e`, and `p1f`.
   - The OR operation combines the outputs of these two AND gates to produce `p1y`.

2. **p2y Output**:
   - This is the result of an OR operation between two 2-input AND gates.
   - The first AND gate takes inputs `p2a` and `p2b`.
   - The second AND gate takes inputs `p2c` and `p2d`.
   - The OR operation combines the outputs of these two AND gates to produce `p2y`.

The implementation uses `logic` for all ports and intermediate signals, adhering to the coding conventions specified. The use of `assign` statements ensures that the logic is purely combinational, as required by the problem statement.
