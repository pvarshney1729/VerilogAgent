Each bit corresponds to a specific state as follows:\n    - y[0]: State A\n    - y[1]: State B\n    - y[2]: State C\n    - y[3]: State D\n    - y[4]: State E\n    - y[5]: State F\n  - `input w`: A 1-bit input that determines state transitions.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output Y1`: A 1-bit output that corresponds to the next state condition for state B (y[1] flip-flop input).\n  - `output Y3`: A 1-bit output that corresponds to the next state condition for state D (y[3] flip-flop input).\n\nFinite-State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- The FSM uses a one-hot state encoding scheme where each state is represented by a single high bit in the 6-bit vector `y`.\n- State Transitions:\n  - State A: \n    - If `w` == 1, transition to State B.\n    - If `w` == 0, remain in State A.\n  - State B:\n    - If `w` == 1, transition to State C.\n    - If `w` == 0, transition to State D.\n  - State C:\n    - If `w` == 1, transition to State E.\n    - If `w` == 0, transition to State D.\n  - State D:\n    - If `w` == 1, transition to State F.\n    - If `w` == 0, transition to State A.\n  - State E:\n    - If `w` == 1, remain in State E.\n    - If `w` == 0, transition to State D.\n  - State F:\n    - If `w` == 1, transition to State C.\n    - If `w` == 0, transition to State D.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- `Y1` is derived from the condition to potentially enter State B. Therefore, `Y1 = y[0] & w`.\n- `Y3` is derived from the condition to potentially enter State D. Therefore, `Y3 = (y[1] & ~w) | (y[2] & ~w) | (y[4] & ~w) | (y[5] & ~w)`.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n- The FSM is assumed to be driven by a clock (not explicitly specified here) but should be designed to operate on the rising edge.\n- The reset conditions are not specified but should initialize the FSM to a known state, typically State A.\n- The module is assumed to be free of race conditions given the one-hot encoding and explicit next-state logic.\n                    "

All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  y (6 bits)\n - input  w\n - output Y1\n - output Y3\n\nConsider the following finite-state machine:\n\n  A (0) --1--> B\n  A (0) --0--> A\n  B (0) --1--> C\n  B (0) --0--> D\n  C (0) --1--> E\n  C (0) --0--> D\n  D (0) --1--> F\n  D (0) --0--> A\n  E (1) --1--> E\n  E (1) --0--> D\n  F (1) --1--> C\n  F (1) --0--> D\n\nAssume that a one-hot code is used with the state assignment y[5:0] =\n000001(A), 000010(B), 000100(C), 001000(D), 010000(E), 100000(F)\n\nThe module should implement the state output logic for this finite-state\nmachine. The output signal Y1 should be the input of state flip-flop\ny[1].

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the FSM using one-hot encoding, we need to derive the output logic for Y1 and Y3 based on the state transitions. Each state is represented by a single high bit in the 6-bit vector `y`. The transitions are determined by the input `w`. \n\n- For Y1, which corresponds to the input of the flip-flop for state B (y[1]), we need to consider transitions into state B. From the FSM, state B is reached from state A when `w` is 1. Thus, Y1 = y[0] & w.\n\n- For Y3, which corresponds to the input of the flip-flop for state D (y[3]), we need to consider transitions into state D. From the FSM, state D is reached from state B when `w` is 0, from state C when `w` is 0, from state E when `w` is 0, and from state F when `w` is 0. Thus, Y3 = (y[1] & ~w) | (y[2] & ~w) | (y[4] & ~w) | (y[5] & ~w).\n\nThe implementation uses combinational logic with `assign` statements to derive Y1 and Y3 based on the current state and input `w`.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic [5:0] y,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic Y1,\n    output logic Y3\n);\n\n    // Combinational logic for Y1 and Y3 based on FSM transitions\n    assign Y1 = (y[0] & w);\n    assign Y3 = (y[1] & ~w) | (y[2] & ~w) | (y[4] & ~w) | (y[5] & ~w);\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
