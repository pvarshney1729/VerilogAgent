<REASONING>
To implement the FSM using one-hot encoding, we need to derive the output logic for Y1 and Y3 based on the state transitions. Each state is represented by a single high bit in the 6-bit vector `y`. The transitions are determined by the input `w`. 

- For Y1, which corresponds to the input of the flip-flop for state B (y[1]), we need to consider transitions into state B. From the FSM, state B is reached from state A when `w` is 1. Thus, Y1 = y[0] & w.

- For Y3, which corresponds to the input of the flip-flop for state D (y[3]), we need to consider transitions into state D. From the FSM, state D is reached from state B when `w` is 0, from state C when `w` is 0, from state E when `w` is 0, and from state F when `w` is 0. Thus, Y3 = (y[1] & ~w) | (y[2] & ~w) | (y[4] & ~w) | (y[5] & ~w).

The implementation uses combinational logic with `assign` statements to derive Y1 and Y3 based on the current state and input `w`.
