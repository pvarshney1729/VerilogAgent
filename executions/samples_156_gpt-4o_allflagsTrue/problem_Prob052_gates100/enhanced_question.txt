Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - `in`: A 100-bit wide input vector, indexed from `in[99]` (most significant bit) to `in[0]` (least significant bit).
- Output Ports:
  - `out_and`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input AND operation.
  - `out_or`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input OR operation.
  - `out_xor`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input XOR operation.

Functional Description:
- The module is a purely combinational circuit, meaning it has no internal state and does not rely on a clock signal.
- The logic for each output is defined as follows:
  1. `out_and`: This output is high (`1`) if and only if all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]` are high (`1`). It is low (`0`) if any bit in the input vector is low (`0`).
  2. `out_or`: This output is high (`1`) if at least one bit of the input vector `in[99:0]` is high (`1`). It is low (`0`) if all bits in the input vector are low (`0`).
  3. `out_xor`: This output is high (`1`) if there is an odd number of high (`1`) bits in the input vector `in[99:0]`. It is low (`0`) if there is an even number of high (`1`) bits.

Operation Precedence and Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the operations are performed on the entire 100-bit input vector simultaneously.
- There are no race conditions or state dependencies, as the module is purely combinational.
- The outputs are directly driven by the inputs with no intermediate storage or sequential logic.

Implementation Constraints:
- Ensure that the bitwise operations are performed efficiently to handle the full 100-bit width of the input vector.
- The module does not require any reset signal, as it does not contain sequential elements or memory.
