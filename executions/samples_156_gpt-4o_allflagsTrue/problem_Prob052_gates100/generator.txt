<REASONING>
The task is to implement a combinational circuit with a 100-bit input and three 1-bit outputs, each representing the result of a different bitwise operation (AND, OR, XOR) on the input vector. The module is purely combinational, so no clock or reset signals are needed. The operations are straightforward and can be implemented using Verilog's reduction operators:

1. **out_and**: This output is the result of a 100-input AND operation. The reduction AND operator (`&`) is used to perform a bitwise AND across all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]`. The result is `1` if all bits are `1`, otherwise `0`.

2. **out_or**: This output is the result of a 100-input OR operation. The reduction OR operator (`|`) is used to perform a bitwise OR across all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]`. The result is `1` if at least one bit is `1`, otherwise `0`.

3. **out_xor**: This output is the result of a 100-input XOR operation. The reduction XOR operator (`^`) is used to perform a bitwise XOR across all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]`. The result is `1` if there is an odd number of `1`s, otherwise `0`.

The implementation uses `assign` statements for combinational logic, adhering to the guideline of using `logic` for port declarations and avoiding `wire` or `reg`.
