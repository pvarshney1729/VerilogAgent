Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port:\n  - `in`: A 100-bit wide input vector, indexed from `in[99]` (most significant bit) to `in[0]` (least significant bit).\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out_and`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input AND operation.\n  - `out_or`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input OR operation.\n  - `out_xor`: A 1-bit output representing the result of a 100-input XOR operation.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module is a purely combinational circuit, meaning it has no internal state and does not rely on a clock signal.\n- The logic for each output is defined as follows:\n  1. `out_and`: This output is high (`1`) if and only if all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]` are high (`1`). It is low (`0`) if any bit in the input vector is low (`0`).\n  2. `out_or`: This output is high (`1`) if at least one bit of the input vector `in[99:0]` is high (`1`). It is low (`0`) if all bits in the input vector are low (`0`).\n  3. `out_xor`: This output is high (`1`) if there is an odd number of high (`1`) bits in the input vector `in[99:0]`. It is low (`0`) if there is an even number of high (`1`) bits.\n\nOperation Precedence and Edge Cases:\n- Ensure that the operations are performed on the entire 100-bit input vector simultaneously.\n- There are no race conditions or state dependencies, as the module is purely combinational.\n- The outputs are directly driven by the inputs with no intermediate storage or sequential logic.\n\nImplementation Constraints:\n- Ensure that the bitwise operations are performed efficiently to handle the full 100-bit width of the input vector.\n- The module does not require any reset signal, as it does not contain sequential elements or memory.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe task is to implement a combinational circuit with a 100-bit input and three 1-bit outputs, each representing the result of a different bitwise operation (AND, OR, XOR) on the input vector. The module is purely combinational, so no clock or reset signals are needed. The operations are straightforward and can be implemented using Verilog's reduction operators:\n\n1. **out_and**: This output is the result of a 100-input AND operation. The reduction AND operator (`&`) is used to perform a bitwise AND across all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]`. The result is `1` if all bits are `1`, otherwise `0`.\n\n2. **out_or**: This output is the result of a 100-input OR operation. The reduction OR operator (`|`) is used to perform a bitwise OR across all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]`. The result is `1` if at least one bit is `1`, otherwise `0`.\n\n3. **out_xor**: This output is the result of a 100-input XOR operation. The reduction XOR operator (`^`) is used to perform a bitwise XOR across all bits of the input vector `in[99:0]`. The result is `1` if there is an odd number of `1`s, otherwise `0`.\n\nThe implementation uses `assign` statements for combinational logic, adhering to the guideline of using `logic` for port declarations and avoiding `wire` or `reg`.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic [99:0] in,\n    output logic out_and,\n    output logic out_or,\n    output logic out_xor\n);\n\n    // Compute the 100-input AND gate output\n    assign out_and = &in;\n\n    // Compute the 100-input OR gate output\n    assign out_or = |in;\n\n    // Compute the 100-input XOR gate output\n    assign out_xor = ^in;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
