<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule`, we need to derive the logic expression for the output `q` based on the provided truth table. By analyzing the truth table, we can observe that the output `q` is `1` in the following cases:
- When `c` is `1`, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `d`.
- When `b` is `1` and `d` is `0`, regardless of the values of `a` and `c`.

This can be expressed as a logical OR between `c` and the AND of `b` and the negation of `d`. The expression for `q` is:
\[ q = c \lor (b \land \lnot d) \]

This expression is purely combinational, so we will use an `assign` statement to implement it. We will declare all ports as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic c,
    input logic d,
    output logic q
);

    // Combinational logic for output q
    assign q = c | (b & ~d);

endmodule
