Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a  // 1-bit input signal\n  - input wire b  // 1-bit input signal\n  - input wire c  // 1-bit input signal\n  - input wire d  // 1-bit input signal\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire q // 1-bit output signal\n\nDesign Specification:\n- The module implements a combinational logic circuit. It does not contain any sequential elements such as flip-flops or latches.\n- The circuit's behavior is determined by the following truth table, which defines the relationship between the inputs (a, b, c, d) and the output (q):\n\n  | a | b | c | d | q |\n  |---|---|---|---|---|\n  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\n- The output (q) is determined based on the combination of input signals (a, b, c, d) as per the truth table.\n- The module does not utilize a clock signal, as it is purely combinational.\n- No reset signals are involved since there are no storage elements.\n- Ensure that the output (q) is updated immediately in response to changes in the input signals, as this is a combinational logic module.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- All input combinations (2^4 = 16 combinations) are covered by the provided truth table.\n- The output is fully specified for all valid input combinations.\n\nEnd of Specification.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
