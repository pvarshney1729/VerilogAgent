Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a  // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire b  // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire c  // 1-bit input signal
  - input wire d  // 1-bit input signal
- Output Ports:
  - output wire q // 1-bit output signal

Design Specification:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit. It does not contain any sequential elements such as flip-flops or latches.
- The circuit's behavior is determined by the following truth table, which defines the relationship between the inputs (a, b, c, d) and the output (q):

  | a | b | c | d | q |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- The output (q) is determined based on the combination of input signals (a, b, c, d) as per the truth table.
- The module does not utilize a clock signal, as it is purely combinational.
- No reset signals are involved since there are no storage elements.
- Ensure that the output (q) is updated immediately in response to changes in the input signals, as this is a combinational logic module.

Boundary Conditions:
- All input combinations (2^4 = 16 combinations) are covered by the provided truth table.
- The output is fully specified for all valid input combinations.
