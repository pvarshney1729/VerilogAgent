Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. Triggering occurs on the positive edge.
  - reset: 1-bit active high reset signal. The reset is synchronous with the clock.
  - d: 8-bit input vector, where d[7] is the most significant bit (MSB) and d[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - q: 8-bit output vector, where q[7] is the MSB and q[0] is the LSB.

Functional Description:
- The module consists of 8 D flip-flops (DFFs).
- Each DFF is responsible for storing one bit of the 8-bit input vector 'd'.
- All DFFs are triggered by the rising edge (positive edge) of the 'clk' signal.
- On the rising edge of 'clk', if 'reset' is high (1), the output vector 'q' is set to zero (all bits in 'q' are reset to 0).
- If 'reset' is low (0) on the rising edge of 'clk', each bit of the output vector 'q' is updated to reflect the corresponding bit of the input vector 'd'.
- Initial State: On reset, each DFF is initialized to 0.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- Ensure that the 'reset' signal is properly synchronized with 'clk' to avoid metastability.
- No additional behavior is specified for when 'reset' and 'clk' are both low or when 'reset' transitions between clock edges.

All signals and operations should be verified for potential race conditions and appropriate timing to ensure reliable operation.
