The reset is synchronous and active high, meaning the reset value is applied on the next clock edge when the reset signal is high. The output `q` should be set to 0x34 when reset is asserted. The implementation uses an `always` block sensitive to the negative edge of `clk` to model the behavior of the D flip-flops.

Otherwise, `q` captures the value of `d`.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic [7:0] d,\n    output logic [7:0] q\n);\n\n    always @(negedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            q <= 8'h34; // Reset to 0x34\n        end else begin\n            q <= d; // Capture input d\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
