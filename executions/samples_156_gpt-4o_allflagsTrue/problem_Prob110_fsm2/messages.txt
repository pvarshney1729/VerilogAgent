The state machine has two states: OFF and ON, with transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, which means the state should immediately transition to OFF when `areset` is high, regardless of the clock.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define two states using an enumerated type `state_t` with values OFF and ON. This helps in making the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always_ff` block to handle state transitions on the rising edge of `clk` or when `areset` is high. If `areset` is high, the state is set to OFF. Otherwise, the state transitions based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`.\n\n3. **Next State and Output Logic**: An `always_comb` block is used to determine the next state and the output `out` based on the current state. In the OFF state, if `j` is 1, the next state is ON; otherwise, it remains OFF. In the ON state, if `k` is 1, the next state is OFF; otherwise, it remains ON. The output `out` is determined by the current state: 0 for OFF and 1 for ON.\n\n4. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The state machine has two states, OFF and ON, with transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`. The output `out` is determined by the current state. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, setting the state to OFF.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define two states, OFF and ON, using an enumerated type `state_t` for clarity and readability. The states are encoded as single-bit values.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always_ff` block to handle state transitions on the rising edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset is asserted. If `areset` is high, the state is set to OFF. Otherwise, the state transitions to `next_state`.\n\n3. **Next State and Output Logic**: An `always_comb` block is used to determine the `next_state` and `out` based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`. This block evaluates the state transition conditions and sets the output accordingly.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is directly tied to the current state, reflecting the Moore machine's behavior where outputs depend only on the state.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic. We ensure that the asynchronous reset is handled correctly and that the state transitions are synchronized with the clock.\n\nThis approach ensures that the module behaves as a Moore state machine with the specified transitions and output behavior.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [0:0] {OFF = 1'b0, ON = 1'b1} state_t;\n    state_t state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic with asynchronous reset\n    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset)\n            state <= OFF;\n        else\n            state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Next state and output logic\n    always_comb begin\n        case (state)\n            OFF: begin\n                out = 1'b0;\n                if (j)\n                    next_state = ON;\n                else\n                    next_state = OFF;\n            end\n            ON: begin\n                out = 1'b1;\n                if (k)\n                    next_state = OFF;\n                else\n                    next_state = ON;\n            end\n            default: begin\n                out = 1'b0;\n                next_state = OFF;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
