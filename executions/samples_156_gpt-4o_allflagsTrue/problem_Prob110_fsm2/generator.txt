To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The state machine has two states, OFF and ON, with transitions based on inputs `j` and `k`. The output `out` is determined by the current state. The reset is asynchronous and active-high, setting the state to OFF.

1. **State Encoding**: We define two states, OFF and ON, using an enumerated type `state_t` for clarity and readability. The states are encoded as single-bit values.

2. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always_ff` block to handle state transitions on the rising edge of the clock or when the asynchronous reset is asserted. If `areset` is high, the state is set to OFF. Otherwise, the state transitions to `next_state`.

3. **Next State and Output Logic**: An `always_comb` block is used to determine the `next_state` and `out` based on the current state and inputs `j` and `k`. This block evaluates the state transition conditions and sets the output accordingly.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is directly tied to the current state, reflecting the Moore machine's behavior where outputs depend only on the state.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic. We ensure that the asynchronous reset is handled correctly and that the state transitions are synchronized with the clock.

This approach ensures that the module behaves as a Moore state machine with the specified transitions and output behavior.
