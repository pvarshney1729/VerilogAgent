Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: Clock signal. One bit.
  - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active high. One bit.
  - `j`: State transition input. One bit.
  - `k`: State transition input. One bit.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: Current state output. One bit.

State Machine Description:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- States: Two states named OFF and ON.
- Initial State: OFF (when `areset` is high).
- State Encoding:
  - OFF: `out = 0`
  - ON: `out = 1`

State Transitions:
- From OFF:
  - If `j = 0`, remain in OFF.
  - If `j = 1`, transition to ON.
- From ON:
  - If `k = 0`, remain in ON.
  - If `k = 1`, transition to OFF.

Reset Behavior:
- Asynchronous reset (`areset` is active high) immediately sets the state to OFF, regardless of the clock.
- Upon reset, `out` is set to 0.

Clocking:
- State transitions occur on the rising edge of `clk`.
- Ensure proper synchronization of inputs `j` and `k` with `clk` to avoid metastability.

Miscellaneous:
- Inputs `j` and `k` should be considered stable and valid during the rising edge of `clk` for accurate state transitions.
- The output `out` reflects the state of the machine and changes synchronously with `clk` according to the state transitions defined above.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that transitions are correctly handled when inputs `j` and `k` change simultaneously with a clock edge.
- Handle any potential race conditions by ensuring stable inputs during state transitions.
