<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - reset: 1-bit, active high synchronous reset.

- Output Ports:
  - q: 10-bit vector, representing the current counter value. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and bit[9] is the most significant bit (MSB).

Functionality:
- The module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive. It completes a full cycle every 1000 clock cycles.
- The counter increments by 1 on each positive edge of the clock.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset input is a synchronous reset, meaning it is sampled on the positive edge of the clock.
- When reset is high, the counter is set to 0 on the next positive clock edge.
- The reset state of the counter is 0.

Boundary Conditions:
- Upon reaching the count of 999, the counter will wrap around to 0 on the next clock cycle.

Additional Notes:
- All counter operations occur synchronously with the clock, ensuring predictable behavior in a clocked environment.
- The module does not require any special handling for underflow or overflow beyond the defined counting range, as it wraps within the specified range of 0 to 999.
