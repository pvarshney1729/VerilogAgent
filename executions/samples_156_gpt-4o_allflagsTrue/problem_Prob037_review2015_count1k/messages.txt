Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit, clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - reset: 1-bit, active high synchronous reset.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - q: 10-bit vector, representing the current counter value. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and bit[9] is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999, inclusive. It completes a full cycle every 1000 clock cycles.\n- The counter increments by 1 on each positive edge of the clock.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset input is a synchronous reset, meaning it is sampled on the positive edge of the clock.\n- When reset is high, the counter is set to 0 on the next positive clock edge.\n- The reset state of the counter is 0.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- Upon reaching the count of 999, the counter will wrap around to 0 on the next clock cycle.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- All counter operations occur synchronously with the clock, ensuring predictable behavior in a clocked environment.\n- The module does not require any special handling for underflow or overflow beyond the defined counting range, as it wraps within the specified range of 0 to 999.\n                    "
