Module Specification for TopModule:

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `y`: A 6-bit wide input port representing the current state of a state machine. The port uses a one-hot encoding scheme where each bit represents a specific state.
  - `w`: A 1-bit input signal used as a transition condition for the state machine.
  
- Output Ports:
  - `Y1`: A 1-bit output signal that represents a specific condition or state output.
  - `Y3`: A 1-bit output signal that represents another specific condition or state output.

State Machine Description:
- The state machine has six states labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- The one-hot encoding for these states is as follows:
  - State A: y[5:0] = 000001
  - State B: y[5:0] = 000010
  - State C: y[5:0] = 000100
  - State D: y[5:0] = 001000
  - State E: y[5:0] = 010000
  - State F: y[5:0] = 100000

- State Transitions:
  - A transitions to B on input w = 0, and remains in A on w = 1.
  - B transitions to C on w = 0, and to D on w = 1.
  - C transitions to E on w = 0, and to D on w = 1.
  - D transitions to F on w = 0, and to A on w = 1.
  - E remains in E on w = 0, and transitions to D on w = 1.
  - F transitions to C on w = 0, and to D on w = 1.

- Initial State:
  - The state machine resets into state A. The reset is asynchronous, meaning the state is set to A regardless of the clock signal when reset is activated.

- State Outputs:
  - States E and F have an output value of 1; all other states have an output value of 0.
  - Y1 and Y3 should be driven based on the current state and potentially other conditions as per the design requirements.

Next-State Logic:
- The module should implement the next-state signals `Y2` and `Y4`, corresponding to the state machine's y[1] and y[3] bits, respectively.
- The logic equations for `Y2` (next state for y[1]) and `Y4` (next state for y[3]) need to be derived based on the state transitions defined by the one-hot encoding.

- All flip-flops or registers within the module should have clearly defined initial values corresponding to the reset state of the state machine.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- Ensure correct behavior at all input boundaries, particularly during transitions where `w` can change state rapidly.
- Consider race conditions where state transitions might overlap with input signal changes.
