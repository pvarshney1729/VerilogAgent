Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for TopModule:\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `y`: A 6-bit wide input port representing the current state of a state machine. The port uses a one-hot encoding scheme where each bit represents a specific state.\n  - `w`: A 1-bit input signal used as a transition condition for the state machine.\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `Y1`: A 1-bit output signal that represents a specific condition or state output.\n  - `Y3`: A 1-bit output signal that represents another specific condition or state output.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The state machine has six states labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n- The one-hot encoding for these states is as follows:\n  - State A: y[5:0] = 000001\n  - State B: y[5:0] = 000010\n  - State C: y[5:0] = 000100\n  - State D: y[5:0] = 001000\n  - State E: y[5:0] = 010000\n  - State F: y[5:0] = 100000\n\n- State Transitions:\n  - A transitions to B on input w = 0, and remains in A on w = 1.\n  - B transitions to C on w = 0, and to D on w = 1.\n  - C transitions to E on w = 0, and to D on w = 1.\n  - D transitions to F on w = 0, and to A on w = 1.\n  - E remains in E on w = 0, and transitions to D on w = 1.\n  - F transitions to C on w = 0, and to D on w = 1.\n\n- Initial State:\n  - The state machine resets into state A. The reset is asynchronous, meaning the state is set to A regardless of the clock signal when reset is activated.\n\n- State Outputs:\n  - States E and F have an output value of 1; all other states have an output value of 0.\n  - Y1 and Y3 should be driven based on the current state and potentially other conditions as per the design requirements.\n\nNext-State Logic:\n- The module should implement the next-state signals `Y2` and `Y4`, corresponding to the state machine's y[1] and y[3] bits, respectively.\n- The logic equations for `Y2` (next state for y[1]) and `Y4` (next state for y[3]) need to be derived based on the state transitions defined by the one-hot encoding.\n\n- All flip-flops or registers within the module should have clearly defined initial values corresponding to the reset state of the state machine.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- Ensure correct behavior at all input boundaries, particularly during transitions where `w` can change state rapidly.\n- Consider race conditions where state transitions might overlap with input signal changes.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe task is to implement a state machine using one-hot encoding with specified transitions and outputs. The state machine has six states (A to F), each represented by a single bit in a 6-bit input vector `y`. The transitions are determined by the input `w`, and the outputs `Y1` and `Y3` are derived from the current state and input conditions.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: Each state is represented by a single bit in `y[5:0]`, where only one bit is high at any time (one-hot encoding).\n2. **State Transitions**: The transitions are defined by the input `w`. For example, from state A, if `w` is 0, the next state is B; if `w` is 1, it remains in A.\n3. **Output Logic**: \n   - `Y1` is high when the state is E or F, which corresponds to `y[4]` or `y[5]` being high.\n   - `Y3` is high when transitioning from B to C (`y[1] & ~w`) or from C to D (`y[2] & w`).\n4. **Next-State Logic**:\n   - `Y2` corresponds to the next state for `y[1]`, which is high when transitioning from A to B or from C to E.\n   - `Y4` corresponds to the next state for `y[3]`, which is high when transitioning from B to D, C to D, or E to D.\n\nThe code implements these logic equations using combinational logic assignments.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic [5:0] y,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic Y1,\n    output logic Y3\n);\n\n    // Output logic\n    assign Y1 = y[4] | y[5]; // High in states E or F\n    assign Y3 = (y[1] & ~w) | (y[2] & w); // High when transitioning from B to C or C to D\n\n    // Next-state logic for Y2 and Y4\n    logic Y2, Y4;\n    assign Y2 = (y[0] & ~w) | (y[2] & ~w); // Next state for y[1]\n    assign Y4 = (y[1] & w) | (y[2] & w) | (y[4] & w); // Next state for y[3]\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
