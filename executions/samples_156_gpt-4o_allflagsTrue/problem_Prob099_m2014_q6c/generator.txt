<REASONING>
The task is to implement a state machine using one-hot encoding with specified transitions and outputs. The state machine has six states (A to F), each represented by a single bit in a 6-bit input vector `y`. The transitions are determined by the input `w`, and the outputs `Y1` and `Y3` are derived from the current state and input conditions.

1. **State Encoding**: Each state is represented by a single bit in `y[5:0]`, where only one bit is high at any time (one-hot encoding).
2. **State Transitions**: The transitions are defined by the input `w`. For example, from state A, if `w` is 0, the next state is B; if `w` is 1, it remains in A.
3. **Output Logic**: 
   - `Y1` is high when the state is E or F, which corresponds to `y[4]` or `y[5]` being high.
   - `Y3` is high when transitioning from B to C (`y[1] & ~w`) or from C to D (`y[2] & w`).
4. **Next-State Logic**:
   - `Y2` corresponds to the next state for `y[1]`, which is high when transitioning from A to B or from C to E.
   - `Y4` corresponds to the next state for `y[3]`, which is high when transitioning from B to D, C to D, or E to D.

The code implements these logic equations using combinational logic assignments.
