<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 100 bits
  - Type: wire
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB), bit[99] is the most significant bit (MSB)

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 100 bits
  - Type: wire
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB), bit[99] is the most significant bit (MSB)

Functionality:
- The module performs a bit reversal operation on the input signal 'in'. 
- The output 'out' will be the reverse of the input 'in', such that the bit in position [0] of 'in' is mapped to position [99] of 'out', the bit in position [1] of 'in' is mapped to position [98] of 'out', continuing in this manner until the bit in position [99] of 'in' is mapped to position [0] of 'out'.

Timing and Logic:
- This is a purely combinational logic module with no sequential elements.
- There is no clock or reset signal involved as the operation is combinational.

Edge Cases:
- All 100 bits must always be accounted for in the operation; no bits should be left unmapped or undefined in the output.
