<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specifications and guidelines. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has three input ports (`clk`, `a`, `b`) and three output ports (`out_assign`, `out_always_comb`, `out_always_ff`). All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Assign Statement**: The XOR operation is implemented using an `assign` statement for `out_assign`. This is a continuous assignment and directly reflects the XOR operation between `a` and `b`.

3. **Combinational Always Block**: The XOR operation is implemented using a combinational `always` block for `out_always_comb`. The `always @(*)` construct is used to ensure that the block is sensitive to any changes in its inputs (`a` and `b`). This block performs the XOR operation and assigns the result to `out_always_comb`.

4. **Clocked Always Block**: The XOR operation is implemented using a clocked `always` block for `out_always_ff`. The block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The result of the XOR operation is assigned to `out_always_ff` using a non-blocking assignment (`<=`), which ensures that the value is registered and delayed by one clock cycle.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all ports and signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring that the clocked block is only sensitive to the positive edge of the clock.

6. **No Synchronous Reset**: The specification does not mention a reset signal, so no reset logic is included in the implementation.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves as specified, with the `out_assign` and `out_always_comb` outputs providing immediate XOR results, and the `out_always_ff` output providing a delayed result due to the flip-flop.
