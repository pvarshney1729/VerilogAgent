<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, should be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- **input** `clk`: Clock signal for triggering sequential logic. Positive edge-triggered.
- **input** `a`: First input bit to the XOR gate.
- **input** `b`: Second input bit to the XOR gate.
- **output** `out_assign`: Output from the XOR operation implemented using an `assign` statement.
- **output** `out_always_comb`: Output from the XOR operation implemented using a combinational `always` block.
- **output** `out_always_ff`: Output from the XOR operation implemented using a clocked `always` block. This output is delayed by one clock cycle due to the flip-flop.

### Implementation Details:

1. **`out_assign`**: 
   - Implement using a continuous assignment with an `assign` statement.
   - `out_assign = a ^ b;`

2. **`out_always_comb`**: 
   - Implement using a combinational logic block.
   - Use an `always @*` block to describe the XOR operation.
   - Ensure there are no latches by covering all input conditions in the block.
   - `out_always_comb = a ^ b;`

3. **`out_always_ff`**: 
   - Implement using a sequential logic block.
   - Use an `always @(posedge clk)` block to describe the XOR operation.
   - This block should use a flip-flop, meaning the output is registered and delayed by one clock cycle.
   - The initial state of the flip-flop is undefined unless explicitly reset.

4. **Reset Conditions**:
   - If required, specify whether the module includes a reset input to initialize the sequential logic.
   - For this specification, assume no explicit reset is used, and the initial state of `out_always_ff` is undefined.

5. **Bit Indexing and Conventions**:
   - `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) for all single-bit ports.
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions for inputs and outputs as defined above.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Since all inputs are single-bit, only two possible input states exist for `a` and `b`: either `0` or `1`.
   - XOR operation should correctly handle all possible combinations: `0 ^ 0`, `0 ^ 1`, `1 ^ 0`, `1 ^ 1`.

By adhering to these guidelines, the module should achieve the desired behavior with clear and correct implementation.
