Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, should be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- **input** `clk`: Clock signal for triggering sequential logic. Positive edge-triggered.\n- **input** `a`: First input bit to the XOR gate.\n- **input** `b`: Second input bit to the XOR gate.\n- **output** `out_assign`: Output from the XOR operation implemented using an `assign` statement.\n- **output** `out_always_comb`: Output from the XOR operation implemented using a combinational `always` block.\n- **output** `out_always_ff`: Output from the XOR operation implemented using a clocked `always` block. This output is delayed by one clock cycle due to the flip-flop.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n1. **`out_assign`**: \n   - Implement using a continuous assignment with an `assign` statement.\n   - `out_assign = a ^ b;`\n\n2. **`out_always_comb`**: \n   - Implement using a combinational logic block.\n   - Use an `always @*` block to describe the XOR operation.\n   - Ensure there are no latches by covering all input conditions in the block.\n   - `out_always_comb = a ^ b;`\n\n3. **`out_always_ff`**: \n   - Implement using a sequential logic block.\n   - Use an `always @(posedge clk)` block to describe the XOR operation.\n   - This block should use a flip-flop, meaning the output is registered and delayed by one clock cycle.\n   - The initial state of the flip-flop is undefined unless explicitly reset.\n\n4. **Reset Conditions**:\n   - If required, specify whether the module includes a reset input to initialize the sequential logic.\n   - For this specification, assume no explicit reset is used, and the initial state of `out_always_ff` is undefined.\n\n5. **Bit Indexing and Conventions**:\n   - `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) for all single-bit ports.\n   - Ensure consistent naming conventions for inputs and outputs as defined above.\n\n6. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - Since all inputs are single-bit, only two possible input states exist for `a` and `b`: either `0` or `1`.\n   - XOR operation should correctly handle all possible combinations: `0 ^ 0`, `0 ^ 1`, `1 ^ 0`, `1 ^ 1`.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, the module should achieve the desired behavior with clear and correct implementation.\n                    "

The module has three outputs: `out_assign`, `out_always_comb`, and `out_always_ff`, each representing a different method of implementing the XOR logic.\n\n1. **out_assign**: This output is implemented using a continuous assignment with an `assign` statement. This is the simplest form of combinational logic in Verilog, directly assigning the result of `a ^ b` to `out_assign`.\n\n2. **out_always_comb**: This output is implemented using a combinational `always` block. The `always @(*)` block is used to ensure that the block is sensitive to any changes in its inputs, `a` and `b`. This block assigns the result of `a ^ b` to `out_always_comb`.\n\n3. **out_always_ff**: This output is implemented using a clocked `always` block, which introduces a flip-flop. The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the XOR operation is performed on the rising edge of the clock, and the result is stored in `out_always_ff`. This introduces a one-clock-cycle delay compared to the other two methods.\n\nThe module adheres to the provided interface and signal names, and it uses `logic` for all ports and signals, as per the coding conventions.
