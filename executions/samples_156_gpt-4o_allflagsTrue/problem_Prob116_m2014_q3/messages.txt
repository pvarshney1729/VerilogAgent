Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specifications:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `x`: A 4-bit wide input vector representing a binary number. The most significant bit is `x[3]` and the least significant bit is `x[0]`.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `f`: A 1-bit output that results from the evaluation of the Karnaugh map.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The output `f` is determined based on the values of the input vector `x`, utilizing the Karnaugh map provided below. The values in the Karnaugh map are as follows:\n\n                x[1]x[2]\n  x[3]x[4]   00  01  11  10\n        00 | d | 0 | d | d |\n        01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |\n        11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |\n        10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |\n\n- `d` represents a \"don't-care\" condition, meaning the output can be either 0 or 1 for these input combinations. Optimal simplification may be applied to minimize logic without altering the specified functional outcomes.\n\nImplementation Details:\n- The module is combinational, implying that the output `f` is purely a function of the inputs without reliance on any clocked elements.\n- Ensure that no latches or unintentional memory elements are formed by explicitly defining the logic for all combinations of `x`.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- All possible input combinations of `x` (from 0000 to 1111 in binary) should be considered and mapped according to the specified Karnaugh map entries.\n- The precedence of operations should comply with standard logical operation rules where necessary.\n- Ensure that the module does not rely on any specific initial state, as it is fully combinational.\n                    "

The expression is directly assigned to `f`, which is declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic [3:0] x,\n    output logic f\n);\n\nalways @(*) begin\n    f = (x[3] & ~x[2]) | (x[2] & x[1]) | (x[3] & x[1]);\nend\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"
