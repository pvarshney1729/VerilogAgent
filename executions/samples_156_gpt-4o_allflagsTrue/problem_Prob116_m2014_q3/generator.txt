<REASONING>
To implement the function `f` based on the given Karnaugh map, we first identify the minterms where `f` is 1:
- For `x = 0101` (x[3]x[2]x[1]x[0] = 0101), `f = 1`
- For `x = 0110` (x[3]x[2]x[1]x[0] = 0110), `f = 1`
- For `x = 1000` (x[3]x[2]x[1]x[0] = 1000), `f = 1`
- For `x = 1001` (x[3]x[2]x[1]x[0] = 1001), `f = 1`
- For `x = 1100` (x[3]x[2]x[1]x[0] = 1100), `f = 1`
- For `x = 1101` (x[3]x[2]x[1]x[0] = 1101), `f = 1`

From these minterms, we can derive the simplified Boolean expression:
- `f = (x[3] & ~x[2]) | (x[2] & x[1]) | (x[3] & x[1])`

This expression covers all the cases where `f` should be 1, and it uses the don't-care conditions to simplify the logic.

The implementation uses an `always @(*)` block to ensure the logic is combinational. The expression is directly assigned to `f`, which is declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

module TopModule(
    input logic [3:0] x,
    output logic f

    f = (x[3] & ~x[2]) | (x[2] & x[1]) | (x[3] & x[1]);
end

endmodule
[DONE]
