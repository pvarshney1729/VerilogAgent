Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input logic in; // 1-bit input signal\n- input logic [1:0] state; // 2-bit input signal representing the current state\n- output logic [1:0] next_state; // 2-bit output signal representing the next state\n- output logic out; // 1-bit output signal\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements the combinational logic for a Moore state machine with four distinct states, represented by 2-bit encoding.\n   - State Encoding:\n     - State A: 2'b00\n     - State B: 2'b01\n     - State C: 2'b10\n     - State D: 2'b11\n\n2. State Transition Logic:\n   - The state transition depends on the current state and the input 'in'.\n   - Transition Table:\n     - If the current state is A (2'b00):\n       - next_state = A (2'b00) if in = 0\n       - next_state = B (2'b01) if in = 1\n     - If the current state is B (2'b01):\n       - next_state = C (2'b10) if in = 0\n       - next_state = B (2'b01) if in = 1\n     - If the current state is C (2'b10):\n       - next_state = A (2'b00) if in = 0\n       - next_state = D (2'b11) if in = 1\n     - If the current state is D (2'b11):\n       - next_state = C (2'b10) if in = 0\n       - next_state = B (2'b01) if in = 1\n\n3. Output Logic:\n   - The output 'out' is determined only by the current state, as per Moore machine characteristics.\n   - Output Table:\n     - out = 0 for states A (2'b00), B (2'b01), and C (2'b10)\n     - out = 1 for state D (2'b11)\n\nNote: Ensure all signal assignments correctly reflect the transition and output logic without introducing race conditions. This specification is focused on the combinational logic aspect and does not include clocked sequential elements or reset conditions.\n                    "
