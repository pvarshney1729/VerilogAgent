<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule`, we need to follow the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module is a Moore state machine with four states, each encoded as a 2-bit value. The state transitions and outputs are determined by the current state and the input signal `in`.

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module with the specified inputs and outputs. All ports are declared as `logic` as per the coding conventions.

2. **Combinational Logic**: We use an `always @(*)` block to implement the combinational logic for state transitions and output determination. This block will compute the `next_state` and `out` based on the current `state` and `in`.

3. **State Transition Logic**: We use a `case` statement to handle the state transitions:
   - For state A (2'b00), the next state is A if `in` is 0, and B if `in` is 1.
   - For state B (2'b01), the next state is C if `in` is 0, and B if `in` is 1.
   - For state C (2'b10), the next state is A if `in` is 0, and D if `in` is 1.
   - For state D (2'b11), the next state is C if `in` is 0, and B if `in` is 1.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state:
   - `out` is 0 for states A, B, and C.
   - `out` is 1 for state D.

5. **Default Case**: We include a default case to handle any unexpected state values, ensuring that `next_state` and `out` are always assigned a value.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the specifications and coding conventions provided.
