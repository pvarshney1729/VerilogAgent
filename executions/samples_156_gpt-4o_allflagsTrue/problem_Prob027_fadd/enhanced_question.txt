Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule is a digital logic circuit implementing a full adder. A full adder takes three input bits—two significant bits and a carry-in—and produces two output bits: a sum and a carry-out.

Port Definitions:
- Inputs:
  - input wire a: 1-bit input representing the first operand.
  - input wire b: 1-bit input representing the second operand.
  - input wire cin: 1-bit input representing the carry-in.

- Outputs:
  - output wire cout: 1-bit output representing the carry-out.
  - output wire sum: 1-bit output representing the sum of the input bits.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit wide, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
- The full adder performs the following operation:
  - sum = a ⊕ b ⊕ cin
  - cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin)

- The operation involves bitwise XOR (⊕) and AND (&) operations to compute the sum and carry-out.

Edge Cases:
- The module properly handles all binary combinations of the inputs a, b, and cin.

Implementation Notes:
- This module describes combinational logic; therefore, there are no clock or reset signals involved.
- Ensure the absence of any race conditions by properly defining the precedence of operations.
