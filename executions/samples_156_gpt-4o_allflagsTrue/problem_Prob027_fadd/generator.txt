<REASONING>
The task is to implement a full adder using Verilog, which takes three 1-bit inputs (a, b, cin) and produces two 1-bit outputs (sum, cout). The sum is calculated using the XOR operation on the inputs, and the carry-out (cout) is calculated using a combination of AND and OR operations. The guidelines specify using logic types for ports and signals, and to use assign statements for combinational logic. Since this is purely combinational logic, there is no need for a clock or reset signal, and hence no need for an always block. The implementation will strictly adhere to the interface and signal names provided.

    // Calculate the sum using XOR
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;

    // Calculate the carry-out using AND and OR
    assign cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (cin & a);
