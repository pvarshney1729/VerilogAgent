Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule is a digital logic circuit implementing a full adder. A full adder takes three input bits\u2014two significant bits and a carry-in\u2014and produces two output bits: a sum and a carry-out.\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Inputs:\n  - input wire a: 1-bit input representing the first operand.\n  - input wire b: 1-bit input representing the second operand.\n  - input wire cin: 1-bit input representing the carry-in.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - output wire cout: 1-bit output representing the carry-out.\n  - output wire sum: 1-bit output representing the sum of the input bits.\n\nBit Indexing and Conventions:\n- All inputs and outputs are single-bit wide, with bit[0] representing the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The full adder performs the following operation:\n  - sum = a \u2295 b \u2295 cin\n  - cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin)\n\n- The operation involves bitwise XOR (\u2295) and AND (&) operations to compute the sum and carry-out.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module properly handles all binary combinations of the inputs a, b, and cin.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- This module describes combinational logic; therefore, there are no clock or reset signals involved.\n- Ensure the absence of any race conditions by properly defining the precedence of operations.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
