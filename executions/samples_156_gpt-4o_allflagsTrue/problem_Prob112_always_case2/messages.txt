Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port: \n  - Name: in\n  - Width: 4 bits\n  - Type: Unsigned\n  - Description: Input vector for the priority encoder. Bit[3] represents the most significant bit, and bit[0] represents the least significant bit.\n\n- Output Port:\n  - Name: pos\n  - Width: 2 bits\n  - Type: Unsigned\n  - Description: Encoded position of the first high bit in the input vector. If all input bits are zero, 'pos' should output 2'b00.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 4-bit priority encoder, a combinational logic circuit.\n- The priority encoder checks the input vector 'in' from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- It outputs the binary position of the first '1' encountered, with priorities assigned from bit[3] to bit[0].\n- If 'in' is 4'b0000, the output 'pos' will be 2'b00, indicating no bits are set.\n\nBehavior and Edge Cases:\n- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clocked elements or registers.\n- No resets are applicable as there are no sequential elements.\n- The module must correctly handle the edge case where all input bits are zero by outputting 2'b00.\n\nExample:\n- Input: in = 4'b1000\n  Output: pos = 2'b11 (indicating bit[3] is high)\n- Input: in = 4'b1010\n  Output: pos = 2'b11 (indicating bit[3] is the first high bit)\n- Input: in = 4'b0000\n  Output: pos = 2'b00 (indicating no bits are high)\n                    "
