Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port: 
  - Name: in
  - Width: 4 bits
  - Type: Unsigned
  - Description: Input vector for the priority encoder. Bit[3] represents the most significant bit, and bit[0] represents the least significant bit.

- Output Port:
  - Name: pos
  - Width: 2 bits
  - Type: Unsigned
  - Description: Encoded position of the first high bit in the input vector. If all input bits are zero, 'pos' should output 2'b00.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 4-bit priority encoder, a combinational logic circuit.
- The priority encoder checks the input vector 'in' from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
- It outputs the binary position of the first '1' encountered, with priorities assigned from bit[3] to bit[0].
- If 'in' is 4'b0000, the output 'pos' will be 2'b00, indicating no bits are set.

Behavior and Edge Cases:
- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clocked elements or registers.
- No resets are applicable as there are no sequential elements.
- The module must correctly handle the edge case where all input bits are zero by outputting 2'b00.

Example:
- Input: in = 4'b1000
  Output: pos = 2'b11 (indicating bit[3] is high)
- Input: in = 4'b1010
  Output: pos = 2'b11 (indicating bit[3] is the first high bit)
- Input: in = 4'b0000
  Output: pos = 2'b00 (indicating no bits are high)
