The module is designed to handle state transitions and output logic based on the current state and input signals. The state machine transitions are implemented using combinational logic, and the outputs are generated based on the current state.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: Each state is represented by a single bit in a 10-bit vector, allowing for easy state transitions using bitwise operations.\n\n2. **Next-State Logic**: The next state is determined by the current state and input signals (`d`, `done_counting`, `ack`). The logic is implemented using a combinational `always` block with a `case` statement to handle each state transition.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The outputs (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) are determined by the current state. A separate combinational `always` block is used to set these outputs based on the state.\n\n4. **One-Hot Encoding**: This encoding simplifies the state transition logic, as each state is represented by a single bit being high, and transitions can be handled with simple bitwise operations.\n\n5. **Combinational Logic**: The use of `always @(*)` ensures that the logic is purely combinational, reacting to any changes in the input signals or current state.\n\n6. **Default Assignments**: Default values are assigned at the beginning of each `always` block to ensure that all outputs and next-state signals are defined for every possible state.\n\n7. **State Transition**: The state transitions are directly mapped from the specification, ensuring that the state machine behaves as expected based on the input conditions.\n\n8. **Output Assertions**: Outputs are asserted based on the current state, aligning with the specified behavior for each state (e.g., `shift_ena` is asserted in states B0, B1, B2, B3).\n\nThis approach ensures that the module adheres to the given specification and coding conventions, providing a clear and efficient implementation of the state machine.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic d,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    input logic [9:0] state,\n    output logic B3_next,\n    output logic S_next,\n    output logic S1_next,\n    output logic Count_next,\n    output logic Wait_next,\n    output logic done,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic shift_ena\n);\n\n    // Next-state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default next-state assignments\n        S_next = 1'b0;\n        S1_next = 1'b0;\n        B3_next = 1'b0;\n        Count_next = 1'b0;\n        Wait_next = 1'b0;\n\n        // State transition logic\n        case (state)\n            10'b0000000001: begin // S\n                S_next = ~d;\n                S1_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000000010: begin // S1\n                S_next = ~d;\n                S1_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000000100: begin // S11\n                S110_next = ~d;\n                S11_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000001000: begin // S110\n                S_next = ~d;\n                B0_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000010000: begin // B0\n                B1_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0000100000: begin // B1\n                B2_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0001000000: begin // B2\n                B3_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0010000000: begin // B3\n                Count_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0100000000: begin // Count\n                Count_next = ~done_counting;\n                Wait_next = done_counting;\n            end\n            10'b1000000000: begin // Wait\n                Wait_next = ~ack;\n                S_next = ack;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default output assignments\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        // Output logic based on current state\n        case (state)\n            10'b0000010000, // B0\n            10'b0000100000, // B1\n            10'b0001000000, // B2\n            10'b0010000000: // B3\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n            10'b0100000000: // Count\n                counting = 1'b1;\n            10'b1000000000: // Wait\n                done = 1'b1;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The outputs `shift_ena`, `counting`, and `done` are asserted based on the current state. For instance, `shift_ena` is asserted in states `B0`, `B1`, `B2`, and `B3`.\n\n4. **Combinational Logic**: The use of combinational logic ensures that the outputs and next-state signals are updated immediately based on the current state and inputs, without the need for a clock edge.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: Although not explicitly shown in the code, the design assumes that the state machine is reset to the `S` state, which is the initial state.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic d,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    input logic [9:0] state,\n    output logic B3_next,\n    output logic S_next,\n    output logic S1_next,\n    output logic Count_next,\n    output logic Wait_next,\n    output logic done,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic shift_ena\n);\n\n    // Next-state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default next-state assignments\n        S_next = 1'b0;\n        S1_next = 1'b0;\n        B3_next = 1'b0;\n        Count_next = 1'b0;\n        Wait_next = 1'b0;\n\n        // State transition logic\n        case (state)\n            10'b0000000001: begin // S\n                S_next = ~d;\n                S1_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000000010: begin // S1\n                S_next = ~d;\n                S1_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000000100: begin // S11\n                S110_next = ~d;\n                S11_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000001000: begin // S110\n                S_next = ~d;\n                B0_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000010000: begin // B0\n                B1_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0000100000: begin // B1\n                B2_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0001000000: begin // B2\n                B3_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0010000000: begin // B3\n                Count_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0100000000: begin // Count\n                Count_next = ~done_counting;\n                Wait_next = done_counting;\n            end\n            10'b1000000000: begin // Wait\n                Wait_next = ~ack;\n                S_next = ack;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default output assignments\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        // Output logic based on current state\n        case (state)\n            10'b0000010000, // B0\n            10'b0000100000, // B1\n            10'b0001000000, // B2\n            10'b0010000000: // B3\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n            10'b0100000000: // Count\n                counting = 1'b1;\n            10'b1000000000: // Wait\n                done = 1'b1;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specified Moore state machine using a one-hot encoding for states. Each state is represented by a single high bit in a 10-bit vector. The next-state logic is implemented using a combinational `always @(*)` block, which evaluates the current state and inputs to determine the next state. The output logic is also implemented using a combinational `always @(*)` block, which sets the outputs based on the current state.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: Each state is represented by a unique bit in a 10-bit vector, allowing for simple state transitions using bitwise operations.\n\n2. **Next-State Logic**: The next state is determined based on the current state and inputs (`d`, `done_counting`, `ack`). For each state, the possible transitions are encoded using conditional assignments.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The outputs (`shift_ena`, `counting`, `done`) are determined solely by the current state, as per the Moore machine definition. The outputs are set based on the active state, with `shift_ena` being asserted in states B0, B1, B2, and B3, `counting` in the Count state, and `done` in the Wait state.\n\n4. **Combinational Logic**: Both the next-state and output logic are implemented using combinational `always @(*)` blocks, ensuring that the logic is evaluated whenever any of the inputs or current state bits change.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and avoiding explicit sensitivity lists in combinational blocks.\n\nThis design ensures that the state machine transitions correctly between states and generates the appropriate outputs based on the current state.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic d,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    input logic [9:0] state,\n    output logic B3_next,\n    output logic S_next,\n    output logic S1_next,\n    output logic Count_next,\n    output logic Wait_next,\n    output logic done,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic shift_ena\n);\n\n    // Next-state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default next-state assignments\n        S_next = 1'b0;\n        S1_next = 1'b0;\n        B3_next = 1'b0;\n        Count_next = 1'b0;\n        Wait_next = 1'b0;\n\n        // State transition logic\n        case (state)\n            10'b0000000001: begin // S\n                S_next = ~d;\n                S1_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000000010: begin // S1\n                S_next = ~d;\n                S1_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000000100: begin // S11\n                S110_next = ~d;\n                S11_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000001000: begin // S110\n                S_next = ~d;\n                B0_next = d;\n            end\n            10'b0000010000: begin // B0\n                B1_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0000100000: begin // B1\n                B2_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0001000000: begin // B2\n                B3_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0010000000: begin // B3\n                Count_next = 1'b1;\n            end\n            10'b0100000000: begin // Count\n                Count_next = ~done_counting;\n                Wait_next = done_counting;\n            end\n            10'b1000000000: begin // Wait\n                Wait_next = ~ack;\n                S_next = ack;\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default output assignments\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        // Output logic based on current state\n        case (state)\n            10'b0000010000, // B0\n            10'b0000100000, // B1\n            10'b0001000000, // B2\n            10'b0010000000: // B3\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n            10'b0100000000: // Count\n                counting = 1'b1;\n            10'b1000000000: // Wait\n                done = 1'b1;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
