Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Inputs:
  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input signal, represents one data input to the multiplexer.
  - `input wire b`: Single-bit input signal, represents the second data input to the multiplexer.
  - `input wire sel`: Single-bit input signal, serves as the select line for the multiplexer.

- Outputs:
  - `output wire out`: Single-bit output signal, represents the selected data output from the multiplexer.

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a 1-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer.
- Multiplexer Operation:
  - When `sel = 0`, the output `out` should be equal to the input `a`.
  - When `sel = 1`, the output `out` should be equal to the input `b`.

Additional Specifications:
- The operation of the multiplexer is purely combinational logic, with no clock or reset requirements.
- The signal `sel` determines the data path through the multiplexer, with `sel = 0` prioritizing input `a` and `sel = 1` prioritizing input `b`.
- There are no edge cases or boundary conditions for this logic, as it operates independently of sequential elements or additional control signals.
- Inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel` are considered stable and valid for determining the output `out` at all times.
