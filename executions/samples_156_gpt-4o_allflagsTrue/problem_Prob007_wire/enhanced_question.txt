<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Description: Single-bit input to the module.
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Description: Single-bit output from the module.
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

Functional Behavior:
- The module functions as a simple wire, directly connecting the input to the output.
- Combinational Logic: The output 'out' is continuously driven by the input 'in' with no delay.
- There are no sequential elements, registers, or flip-flops involved.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Since the input and output are both one bit, no special handling for edge cases or input boundaries is necessary.

Additional Notes:
- There are no additional signals, resets, or clock inputs required for this module.
- Since the module acts purely as a wire, no initial values or synchronous/asynchronous behavior is applicable.
