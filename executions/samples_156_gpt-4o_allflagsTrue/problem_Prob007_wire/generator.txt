<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple Verilog module named `TopModule` that acts as a wire, connecting the input `in` directly to the output `out`. The guidelines and coding conventions provided are more applicable to more complex designs involving synchronous resets and sequential logic, which are not required for this simple wire module. Therefore, the implementation will be straightforward, using an `assign` statement to connect the input to the output. Since the module is purely combinational and acts as a wire, there is no need for an `always` block or any sequential logic elements.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic in,
    output logic out
);
    assign out = in;
endmodule
[DONE]

module TopModule(
    input  logic in,

    assign out = in;
endmodule
