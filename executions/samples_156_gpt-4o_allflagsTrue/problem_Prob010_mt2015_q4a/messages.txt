Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: \n  - `input wire x` (1-bit, LSB is bit[0])\n  - `input wire y` (1-bit, LSB is bit[0])\n- Output:\n  - `output wire z` (1-bit, LSB is bit[0])\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module implements a combinational logic function.\n- The output `z` is determined by the boolean expression: z = (x XOR y) AND x.\n- The operation precedence is as follows:\n  - Perform the XOR operation between inputs `x` and `y`.\n  - Perform the AND operation between the result of the XOR and input `x`.\n\nAdditional Details:\n- As this is a purely combinational logic function, no clock or reset signals are involved.\n- Ensure there are no race conditions, as this is a simple combinational circuit.\n- All operations are performed in a single logical step without any sequential dependencies.\n- Consider edge cases:\n  - If `x` and `y` are both 0, the output `z` should be 0.\n  - If `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, the output `z` should be 1.\n  - If `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, the output `z` should be 0.\n  - If both `x` and `y` are 1, the output `z` should be 0.\n\nVerification:\n- Ensure the logic is tested against all possible input combinations for correctness.\n                    "
