Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: 
  - `input wire x` (1-bit, LSB is bit[0])
  - `input wire y` (1-bit, LSB is bit[0])
- Output:
  - `output wire z` (1-bit, LSB is bit[0])

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a combinational logic function.
- The output `z` is determined by the boolean expression: z = (x XOR y) AND x.
- The operation precedence is as follows:
  - Perform the XOR operation between inputs `x` and `y`.
  - Perform the AND operation between the result of the XOR and input `x`.

Additional Details:
- As this is a purely combinational logic function, no clock or reset signals are involved.
- Ensure there are no race conditions, as this is a simple combinational circuit.
- All operations are performed in a single logical step without any sequential dependencies.
- Consider edge cases:
  - If `x` and `y` are both 0, the output `z` should be 0.
  - If `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, the output `z` should be 1.
  - If `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, the output `z` should be 0.
  - If both `x` and `y` are 1, the output `z` should be 0.

Verification:
- Ensure the logic is tested against all possible input combinations for correctness.
