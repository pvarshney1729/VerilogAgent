Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, triggering sequential logic on the positive edge.
  - `input wire reset`: Active high synchronous reset.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg shift_ena`: Control signal for enabling the shift register.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.
- The primary function of the FSM is to assert `shift_ena` for precisely 4 consecutive clock cycles when a designated bit pattern is detected.
- Upon being reset, the FSM will immediately assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles, after which `shift_ena` will remain de-asserted (logic 0) indefinitely until the next reset signal is received.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset operation is synchronous with the clock signal and is triggered on the positive edge.
- During the synchronous reset, `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles starting from the first clock cycle after the reset has been detected.

Signal Conventions:
- All signals are treated as unsigned and are 1 bit in width unless otherwise specified.
- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

FSM Operation:
- The FSM operates under the assumption of positive edge-triggered sequential logic.
- The initial state of `shift_ena` upon module instantiation is de-asserted (logic 0) until a reset is detected.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure no unintentional assertion of `shift_ena` occurs outside of the defined conditions (during reset or upon detection of the specific pattern).
- The module should handle continuous reset assertions by maintaining the reset behavior as defined without glitches or race conditions.

This specification ensures a clear understanding of the intended operation and provides a guideline for implementing the module correctly in Verilog.
