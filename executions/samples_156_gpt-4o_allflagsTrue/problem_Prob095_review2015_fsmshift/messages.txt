Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal, triggering sequential logic on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire reset`: Active high synchronous reset.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg shift_ena`: Control signal for enabling the shift register.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) responsible for controlling a shift register.\n- The primary function of the FSM is to assert `shift_ena` for precisely 4 consecutive clock cycles when a designated bit pattern is detected.\n- Upon being reset, the FSM will immediately assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles, after which `shift_ena` will remain de-asserted (logic 0) indefinitely until the next reset signal is received.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset operation is synchronous with the clock signal and is triggered on the positive edge.\n- During the synchronous reset, `shift_ena` is asserted for 4 clock cycles starting from the first clock cycle after the reset has been detected.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- All signals are treated as unsigned and are 1 bit in width unless otherwise specified.\n- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFSM Operation:\n- The FSM operates under the assumption of positive edge-triggered sequential logic.\n- The initial state of `shift_ena` upon module instantiation is de-asserted (logic 0) until a reset is detected.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure no unintentional assertion of `shift_ena` occurs outside of the defined conditions (during reset or upon detection of the specific pattern).\n- The module should handle continuous reset assertions by maintaining the reset behavior as defined without glitches or race conditions.\n\nThis specification ensures a clear understanding of the intended operation and provides a guideline for implementing the module correctly in Verilog.\n                    "

This countdown controls the duration for which `shift_ena` remains asserted.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` signal is driven by a combinational always block. It is asserted (`1`) when `shift_counter` is non-zero, and deasserted (`0`) when `shift_counter` reaches zero.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with respect to the clock. The reset condition is checked within the sequential always block triggered by `posedge clk`.\n\nThis design ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 cycles after a reset and remains deasserted until the next reset.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    output logic shift_ena\n);\n\n    logic [2:0] shift_counter;\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            shift_counter <= 3'd4; // Initialize counter to 4\n        end else if (shift_counter != 3'd0) begin\n            shift_counter <= shift_counter - 1;\n        end\n    end\n\n    always @(*) begin\n        shift_ena = (shift_counter != 3'd0);\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
