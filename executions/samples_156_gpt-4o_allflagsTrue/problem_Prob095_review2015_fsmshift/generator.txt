<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` is based on the requirement to assert the `shift_ena` signal for exactly 4 clock cycles upon a synchronous reset. The module uses a 3-bit counter (`shift_counter`) to track the number of cycles for which `shift_ena` should be asserted.

1. **Interface Definition**: The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `shift_ena`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Counter Initialization**: On a synchronous reset (detected on the positive edge of `clk`), the `shift_counter` is initialized to 4 (`3'd4`). This ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for the next 4 clock cycles.

3. **Counter Decrement**: If `shift_counter` is not zero, it is decremented by 1 on each clock cycle. This countdown controls the duration for which `shift_ena` remains asserted.

4. **Output Logic**: The `shift_ena` signal is driven by a combinational always block. It is asserted (`1`) when `shift_counter` is non-zero, and deasserted (`0`) when `shift_counter` reaches zero.

5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with respect to the clock. The reset condition is checked within the sequential always block triggered by `posedge clk`.

This design ensures that `shift_ena` is asserted for exactly 4 cycles after a reset and remains deasserted until the next reset.
