Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire a`: 1-bit input, represents the MSB of the 'ab' pair in the Karnaugh map.\n  - `input wire b`: 1-bit input, represents the LSB of the 'ab' pair in the Karnaugh map.\n  - `input wire c`: 1-bit input, represents the MSB of the 'cd' pair in the Karnaugh map.\n  - `input wire d`: 1-bit input, represents the LSB of the 'cd' pair in the Karnaugh map.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out`: 1-bit output, the result of the logic function derived from the Karnaugh map.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module implements a combinational logic circuit as defined by the following Karnaugh map:\n\n              ab\n   cd   00  01  11  10\n   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n\n- Input Encoding:\n  - `cd` (row selection): `00`, `01`, `11`, `10`\n  - `ab` (column selection): `00`, `01`, `11`, `10`\n\n- Output Logic:\n  - The output `out` is determined by the intersection of the input pairs (`cd`, `ab`) in the Karnaugh map.\n  - Each cell in the map represents the logic level (0 or 1) that `out` should take based on the input combination.\n\n- No clock or reset signals are involved, as this is purely combinational logic.\n\n- The bit indexing follows: `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit.\n\nBehavioral Description:\n- For each combination of inputs `(c, d, a, b)`, determine the value of `out` based on the given Karnaugh map.\n- The operation is independent of any timing constraints, as it is purely combinational.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- All possible 4-bit input combinations `(a, b, c, d)` are covered by the Karnaugh map.\n- There are no undefined or illegal states for the inputs.\n\nThis specification ensures that the implementation of the TopModule will be correct and unambiguous, with a clear understanding of the input-output relationships as defined by the Karnaugh map.\n                    "
