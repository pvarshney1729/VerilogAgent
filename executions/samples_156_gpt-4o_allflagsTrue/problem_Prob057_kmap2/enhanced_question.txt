Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a`: 1-bit input, represents the MSB of the 'ab' pair in the Karnaugh map.
  - `input wire b`: 1-bit input, represents the LSB of the 'ab' pair in the Karnaugh map.
  - `input wire c`: 1-bit input, represents the MSB of the 'cd' pair in the Karnaugh map.
  - `input wire d`: 1-bit input, represents the LSB of the 'cd' pair in the Karnaugh map.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: 1-bit output, the result of the logic function derived from the Karnaugh map.

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit as defined by the following Karnaugh map:

              ab
   cd   00  01  11  10
   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

- Input Encoding:
  - `cd` (row selection): `00`, `01`, `11`, `10`
  - `ab` (column selection): `00`, `01`, `11`, `10`

- Output Logic:
  - The output `out` is determined by the intersection of the input pairs (`cd`, `ab`) in the Karnaugh map.
  - Each cell in the map represents the logic level (0 or 1) that `out` should take based on the input combination.

- No clock or reset signals are involved, as this is purely combinational logic.

- The bit indexing follows: `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit.

Behavioral Description:
- For each combination of inputs `(c, d, a, b)`, determine the value of `out` based on the given Karnaugh map.
- The operation is independent of any timing constraints, as it is purely combinational.

Edge Cases:
- All possible 4-bit input combinations `(a, b, c, d)` are covered by the Karnaugh map.
- There are no undefined or illegal states for the inputs.

This specification ensures that the implementation of the TopModule will be correct and unambiguous, with a clear understanding of the input-output relationships as defined by the Karnaugh map.
