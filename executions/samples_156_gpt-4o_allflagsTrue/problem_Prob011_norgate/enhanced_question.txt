Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a`: 1-bit wide input signal. This signal represents one of the inputs to the NOR gate.
  - `input wire b`: 1-bit wide input signal. This signal represents the other input to the NOR gate.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: 1-bit wide output signal. This signal is the result of the NOR operation on inputs `a` and `b`.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic function, specifically a NOR gate, with the following logic equation:
  - `out = ~(a | b)`
  - This represents the logical NOR operation, where the output is true (1) if and only if both inputs `a` and `b` are false (0).

Additional Notes:
- All input and output ports are unsigned and single-bit wide.
- This design does not contain any sequential elements, so no clock or reset signals are required.
- The output `out` is directly dependent on the current values of inputs `a` and `b`, with no delay or storage elements involved.
- Input signals `a` and `b` can change at any time, and the output `out` will reflect the logical NOR operation of these inputs immediately.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are single-bit.
