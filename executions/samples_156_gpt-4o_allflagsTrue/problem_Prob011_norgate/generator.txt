<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple NOR gate using Verilog. The NOR gate is a basic combinational logic gate that outputs true (1) only when both inputs are false (0). The Verilog implementation will use an assign statement to directly map the NOR operation to the output. This is a straightforward combinational logic implementation, so there is no need for a clock or reset signal. The guidelines and conventions provided are more applicable to sequential logic, which is not required for this task. Therefore, we will focus on using the correct syntax and conventions for combinational logic.

    input  logic b,
    output logic out

    // Implementing the NOR gate logic
    assign out = ~(a | b);
