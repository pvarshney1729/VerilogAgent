Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for TopModule:\n\n1. Module Name:\n   - TopModule\n\n2. Port Definitions:\n   - Input Ports:\n     - `input wire a` (1-bit, unsigned)\n     - `input wire b` (1-bit, unsigned)\n     - `input wire c` (1-bit, unsigned)\n   - Output Ports:\n     - `output wire out` (1-bit, unsigned)\n\n3. Logic Functionality:\n   - The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following Karnaugh map:\n\n     Karnaugh Map:\n     ```\n          a\n      bc   0   1\n      00 | 0 | 1 |\n      01 | 1 | 1 |\n      11 | 1 | 1 |\n      10 | 1 | 1 |\n     ```\n\n   - Binary Representation:\n     - The input vector can be represented as {b, c, a}.\n     - For a = 0:\n       - {bc = 00}: out = 0\n       - {bc = 01}: out = 1\n       - {bc = 10}: out = 1\n       - {bc = 11}: out = 1\n     - For a = 1:\n       - {bc = 00}: out = 1\n       - {bc = 01}: out = 1\n       - {bc = 10}: out = 1\n       - {bc = 11}: out = 1\n\n4. Logic Expression:\n   - The output `out` can be expressed as:\n     - `out = (b & ~c) | a`\n\n5. Implementation Details:\n   - The module is purely combinational, with no clock or reset signals involved.\n   - There are no sequential elements; therefore, initial values and reset behavior are not applicable.\n   - The module should be implemented to ensure minimal logic delay and efficient resource utilization.\n  \n6. Edge Cases:\n   - All possible combinations of inputs {a, b, c} are explicitly covered by the Karnaugh map.\n   - Ensure correct operation for all input transitions.\n\n7. Conventions:\n   - Bit indexing and MSB/LSB conventions are not applicable as all ports are single-bit.\n                    "
