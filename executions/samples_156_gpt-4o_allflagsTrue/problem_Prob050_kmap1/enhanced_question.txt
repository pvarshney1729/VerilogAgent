Module Specification for TopModule:

1. Module Name:
   - TopModule

2. Port Definitions:
   - Input Ports:
     - `input wire a` (1-bit, unsigned)
     - `input wire b` (1-bit, unsigned)
     - `input wire c` (1-bit, unsigned)
   - Output Ports:
     - `output wire out` (1-bit, unsigned)

3. Logic Functionality:
   - The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the following Karnaugh map:

     Karnaugh Map:
     ```
          a
      bc   0   1
      00 | 0 | 1 |
      01 | 1 | 1 |
      11 | 1 | 1 |
      10 | 1 | 1 |
     ```

   - Binary Representation:
     - The input vector can be represented as {b, c, a}.
     - For a = 0:
       - {bc = 00}: out = 0
       - {bc = 01}: out = 1
       - {bc = 10}: out = 1
       - {bc = 11}: out = 1
     - For a = 1:
       - {bc = 00}: out = 1
       - {bc = 01}: out = 1
       - {bc = 10}: out = 1
       - {bc = 11}: out = 1

4. Logic Expression:
   - The output `out` can be expressed as:
     - `out = (b & ~c) | a`

5. Implementation Details:
   - The module is purely combinational, with no clock or reset signals involved.
   - There are no sequential elements; therefore, initial values and reset behavior are not applicable.
   - The module should be implemented to ensure minimal logic delay and efficient resource utilization.
  
6. Edge Cases:
   - All possible combinations of inputs {a, b, c} are explicitly covered by the Karnaugh map.
   - Ensure correct operation for all input transitions.

7. Conventions:
   - Bit indexing and MSB/LSB conventions are not applicable as all ports are single-bit.
