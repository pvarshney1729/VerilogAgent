<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module `TopModule` is specified with the following interface and functionality. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input clk`: The clock signal, positive-edge triggered.
- `input in`: Serial data input.
- `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal.
- `output [7:0] out_byte`: An 8-bit output representing the correctly received data byte.
- `output done`: A signal indicating the successful reception of a complete byte.

The module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to process a serial stream of bits according to an asynchronous serial communication protocol. The protocol transmits data with the following structure: one start bit (`0`), followed by 8 data bits, and one stop bit (`1`). The line remains at logic `1` when idle.

**FSM Operation:**
1. **Idle State**: The FSM begins in the idle state, waiting for a start bit (`0`).
2. **Start Bit Detection**: Upon detecting a start bit, the FSM moves to the data reception state.
3. **Data Reception**: The FSM sequentially captures 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit (LSB). The order of reception is bit[0] (LSB) to bit[7] (MSB).
4. **Stop Bit Verification**: After the 8 data bits, the FSM expects a stop bit (`1`). If the stop bit is correct, the FSM asserts `done` for one clock cycle and `out_byte` contains the valid data byte.
5. **Error Handling**: If the stop bit is not `1`, the FSM returns to the idle state, discarding the received bits and waiting for a valid start bit.

**Signal Specifications:**
- The `reset` signal synchronously initializes the FSM to the idle state. Upon reset, `out_byte` is set to a don't-care state, and `done` is deasserted.
- The `out_byte` is only meaningful when `done` is asserted. Otherwise, its value is considered don't-care.
- The `done` signal is asserted for one clock cycle upon successful byte reception and remains deasserted otherwise.

**Edge Cases:**
- If the start bit is not detected, the FSM remains in the idle state.
- The reception of the start bit, 8 data bits, and stop bit must be continuous; any deviation returns the FSM to the idle state.
- The FSM ensures no race conditions by relying on the positive edge of the clock for all sequential operations.

The FSM and its associated logic ensure robust byte reception in adherence to the defined protocol, considering the least significant bit-first transmission order.
