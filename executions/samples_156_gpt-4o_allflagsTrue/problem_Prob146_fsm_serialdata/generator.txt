To implement the `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that processes a serial bit stream according to a specific protocol. The protocol involves detecting a start bit (0), receiving 8 data bits, and verifying a stop bit (1). The FSM must handle these states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP, and DONE.

1. **IDLE State**: The FSM waits for a start bit (0). If detected, it transitions to the START state.
2. **START State**: This state is a transient state, immediately transitioning to the DATA state to begin capturing data bits.
3. **DATA State**: The FSM captures 8 data bits, starting with the least significant bit (LSB). A counter tracks the number of bits received.
4. **STOP State**: After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM checks for a stop bit (1). If the stop bit is correct, it transitions to the DONE state; otherwise, it returns to IDLE.
5. **DONE State**: The FSM asserts the `done` signal and outputs the received byte. It then returns to IDLE to await the next byte.

The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize all states and registers. The `out_byte` is only valid when `done` is asserted. The FSM ensures robust byte reception by adhering to the protocol and handling errors by returning to the IDLE state when the stop bit is incorrect.
