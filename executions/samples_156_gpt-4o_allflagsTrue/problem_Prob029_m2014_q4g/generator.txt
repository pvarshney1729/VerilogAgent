<REASONING>
To implement the specified circuit, we need to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with three input ports (`in1`, `in2`, `in3`) and one output port (`out`). The circuit consists of a two-input XNOR gate followed by a two-input XOR gate. The XNOR gate takes `in1` and `in2` as inputs and its output is connected to one input of the XOR gate. The other input of the XOR gate is `in3`, and the output of the XOR gate is connected to the module's output `out`.

The implementation uses continuous assignment statements (`assign`) for combinational logic, as there is no need for an `always` block. The `logic` data type is used for all ports and internal signals, adhering to the coding conventions. The XNOR operation is performed using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) followed by a bitwise NOT (`~`) to achieve the XNOR functionality. The XOR operation is straightforward using the `^` operator.

No synchronous reset or clock is needed as the circuit is purely combinational.
