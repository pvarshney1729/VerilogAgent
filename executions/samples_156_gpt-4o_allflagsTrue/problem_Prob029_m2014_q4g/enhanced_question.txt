Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input in1`: 1-bit; represents the first operand for the XNOR gate.
  - `input in2`: 1-bit; represents the second operand for the XNOR gate.
  - `input in3`: 1-bit; serves as the second operand for the XOR gate.

- Output Ports:
  - `output out`: 1-bit; represents the final output of the XOR gate.

Circuit Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit with the following structure:
  1. A two-input XNOR gate receives `in1` and `in2` as inputs.
     - Logical Operation: XNOR(in1, in2) = ~(in1 ^ in2)
  2. The output of the XNOR gate is connected to the first input of a two-input XOR gate.
  3. The second input of the XOR gate is `in3`.
     - Logical Operation: XOR(XNOR(in1, in2), in3) = (XNOR(in1, in2)) ^ in3

- The output of the XOR gate is assigned to `out`.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are single bits, with the least significant bit (`LSB`) at index 0.
- The operations are combinational and do not involve any clocking or sequential elements.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- As all inputs are single bits and the operations are purely combinational, there are no additional edge cases or input boundary conditions beyond the natural binary behavior of the gates.
