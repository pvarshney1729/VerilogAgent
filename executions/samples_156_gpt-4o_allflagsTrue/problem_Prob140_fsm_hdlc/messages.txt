All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  reset\n - input  in\n - output disc\n - output flag\n - output err\n\nSynchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of\ndata to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of\nframes (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a\n\"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from\naccidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5\nconsecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need\nto signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a\nMoore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\nWhen the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the\nprevious input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The\noutput signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the\nclock cycle after the condition occurs. Assume all sequential\nlogic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n"

        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: clk (1 bit) - Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- Input: reset (1 bit) - Active high, synchronous reset signal.\n- Input: in (1 bit) - Serial data input stream.\n- Output: disc (1 bit) - Asserted for one cycle when a bit is to be discarded.\n- Output: flag (1 bit) - Asserted for one cycle to indicate the detection of a frame boundary flag.\n- Output: err (1 bit) - Asserted for one cycle when an error condition (7 or more consecutive 1s) is detected.\n\nDescription:\nThe module implements a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to decode a continuous HDLC bit stream, identifying specific patterns to control the outputs.\n\nFSM Logic:\n- Initial State on Reset: Upon a synchronous reset, the FSM initializes to a state as if the previous input bit was '0'.\n- State Transitions: Occur on the positive edge of the clock.\n- Outputs are asserted for the entire clock cycle following the detection of their respective conditions.\n\nPattern Recognition:\n1. Sequence \"0111110\":\n   - Output 'disc' is asserted for one clock cycle, indicating that the trailing '0' should be discarded.\n2. Sequence \"01111110\":\n   - Output 'flag' is asserted for one clock cycle, indicating detection of a frame boundary.\n3. Sequence \"01111111...\":\n   - Output 'err' is asserted for one clock cycle when 7 or more consecutive '1's are detected, indicating an error.\n\nBehavioral Notes:\n- Input bit 'in' is sampled on the rising edge of 'clk'.\n- Bit indexing: The least significant bit is denoted as bit[0].\n- Ensure no race conditions occur by specifying that state transitions and output updates are both triggered by the clock edge.\n- All outputs (disc, flag, err) are reset to '0' during the initialization cycle and when their respective conditions are not met.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If 'reset' is asserted, the FSM returns to the initial state immediately after the rising edge of 'clk' while 'reset' is high.\n- The FSM must correctly handle back-to-back flag detections and error conditions without missing any transitions or assertions.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided. The module uses a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to detect specific bit patterns in a serial data stream, which are relevant to HDLC framing.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM is designed with eight states (S0 to S7) to track the number of consecutive '1's received. The states are encoded using a 3-bit `state_t` type.\n\n2. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM is reset synchronously with the clock. When the `reset` signal is high, the FSM transitions to the initial state (S0), which behaves as if the previous input was '0'.\n\n3. **State Transitions**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input bit `in`. Each state corresponds to the number of consecutive '1's detected.
