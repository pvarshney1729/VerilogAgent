<REASONING>
The module `TopModule` is designed to implement a sequential circuit based on the provided waveform. The key observations from the waveform are:

1. When the input `a` is high, the output `q` is set to 4 on each rising edge of the clock.
2. When `a` is low, `q` increments by 1 on each rising edge of the clock, cycling through values 0 to 6.
3. After `q` reaches 6, it resets to 0 on the next increment when `a` is low.

The implementation uses a single always block triggered on the rising edge of `clk`. Inside the block, a conditional statement checks the value of `a`. If `a` is high, `q` is set to 4. If `a` is low, another conditional checks if `q` is 6, in which case `q` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `q` is incremented by 1.

This logic ensures that the output `q` behaves as specified in the waveform, with the correct cycling and resetting behavior.
