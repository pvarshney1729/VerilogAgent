Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module `TopModule` is a sequential circuit with the following interface:\n\n- `input wire clk`: The clock signal. This module uses a rising edge-triggered clock.\n- `input wire a`: A single-bit input signal.\n- `output reg [2:0] q`: A 3-bit output register. Bit index [0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1. **Clock and Reset Behavior**:\n   - The module operates on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n   - There is no explicit reset signal provided. Assume the initial state of `q` is unspecified and can be treated as 'don't care' (denoted as 'x').\n\n2. **Output `q` Behavior**:\n   - At time 0ns, when `clk` is low and `a` is high, `q` is unspecified (x).\n   - On each rising edge of `clk` when `a` is high, `q` holds the value 4.\n   - On each rising edge of `clk` when `a` is low, `q` increments its value by 1 in a modulo-7 counter manner, cycling through values 0 to 6.\n   - When `q` reaches 6, the next increment results in `q` resetting to 0.\n\n3. **Operation Precedence**:\n   - The module does not change `q` on the falling edge of `clk`.\n   - The output `q` only changes on the rising edge of `clk` based on the value of `a`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases and Input Boundaries**:\n   - If `a` remains high, `q` will continuously output 4 irrespective of previous values.\n   - If `a` remains low, `q` will increment from its current value on each rising edge of `clk`, cycling back to 0 after reaching 6.\n\n5. **Initial Condition**:\n   - Although `q` is initially unspecified, once the first active clock edge (rising) is encountered with `a` high, `q` is set to 4.\n\nThe timing diagram provided outlines the expected behavior as described, with transitions occurring on rising edges of the clock and dependent on the state of `a`.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe module `TopModule` is designed to implement a sequential circuit based on the provided waveform. The key observations from the waveform are:\n\n1. When the input `a` is high, the output `q` is set to 4 on each rising edge of the clock.\n2. When `a` is low, `q` increments by 1 on each rising edge of the clock, cycling through values 0 to 6.\n3. After `q` reaches 6, it resets to 0 on the next increment when `a` is low.\n\nThe implementation uses a single always block triggered on the rising edge of `clk`. Inside the block, a conditional statement checks the value of `a`. If `a` is high, `q` is set to 4. If `a` is low, another conditional checks if `q` is 6, in which case `q` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `q` is incremented by 1.\n\nThis logic ensures that the output `q` behaves as specified in the waveform, with the correct cycling and resetting behavior.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic a,\n    output logic [2:0] q\n);\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (a) begin\n            q <= 3'b100; // Set q to 4 when a is high\n        end else begin\n            if (q == 3'b110) begin\n                q <= 3'b000; // Reset q to 0 after reaching 6\n            end else begin\n                q <= q + 1; // Increment q by 1\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
