Used to select between input 'a' and input 'b'.\n  - a: 8-bit vector [7:0], unsigned. Represents one data input to the multiplexer.\n  - b: 8-bit vector [7:0], unsigned. Represents another data input to the multiplexer.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: 8-bit vector [7:0], unsigned. Outputs the selected input data based on 'sel'.\n\nOperational Description:\n- The multiplexer selects between inputs 'a' and 'b' based on the 'sel' signal.\n- If 'sel' is 0, 'out' should be equal to input 'a'.\n- If 'sel' is 1, 'out' should be equal to input 'b'.\n- The operation is purely combinational with no clock or reset signals involved.\n\nBit Indexing Convention:\n- All vectors are indexed with bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Ensure that the 'out' port is correctly driven with the selected 8-bit input.\n- Verify that no unintended bitwise operations or misassignments occur in the logic.\n- Ensure that the signal 'out' reflects the correct 8-bit data width, avoiding any truncation or incorrect bit assignment.\n- There are no sequential elements in this module, thus no initial values or reset conditions to be defined.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- All possible values of 'sel' (0 or 1) should be handled correctly.\n- The module should handle all possible 8-bit input combinations for 'a' and 'b' without error.\n                    "
