<REASONING>
The original implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer had a bug because it attempted to perform bitwise operations on the entire 8-bit vectors without correctly handling the output width. The output was declared as a single bit, which is incorrect for an 8-bit multiplexer. The corrected implementation involves the following steps:

1. **Correct Output Width**: The output should be an 8-bit vector to match the inputs 'a' and 'b'. This ensures that the multiplexer can output the full 8-bit value of the selected input.

2. **Correct Multiplexer Logic**: Use a conditional operator to select between the two 8-bit inputs based on the 'sel' signal. This is a straightforward way to implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog.

3. **Adhere to Coding Conventions**: Use the `assign` statement for combinational logic, as there is no need for an `always` block in this simple multiplexer design. The use of `logic` is not necessary in this context as we are using simple `assign` statements.

By following these steps, the corrected module will properly implement an 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer.
