Specification for an 8-bit 2-to-1 Multiplexer:

Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- Input Ports:
  - sel: 1-bit, unsigned. Used to select between input 'a' and input 'b'.
  - a: 8-bit vector [7:0], unsigned. Represents one data input to the multiplexer.
  - b: 8-bit vector [7:0], unsigned. Represents another data input to the multiplexer.

- Output Ports:
  - out: 8-bit vector [7:0], unsigned. Outputs the selected input data based on 'sel'.

Operational Description:
- The multiplexer selects between inputs 'a' and 'b' based on the 'sel' signal.
- If 'sel' is 0, 'out' should be equal to input 'a'.
- If 'sel' is 1, 'out' should be equal to input 'b'.
- The operation is purely combinational with no clock or reset signals involved.

Bit Indexing Convention:
- All vectors are indexed with bit[0] as the least significant bit (LSB).

Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the 'out' port is correctly driven with the selected 8-bit input.
- Verify that no unintended bitwise operations or misassignments occur in the logic.
- Ensure that the signal 'out' reflects the correct 8-bit data width, avoiding any truncation or incorrect bit assignment.
- There are no sequential elements in this module, thus no initial values or reset conditions to be defined.

Edge Cases:
- All possible values of 'sel' (0 or 1) should be handled correctly.
- The module should handle all possible 8-bit input combinations for 'a' and 'b' without error.
