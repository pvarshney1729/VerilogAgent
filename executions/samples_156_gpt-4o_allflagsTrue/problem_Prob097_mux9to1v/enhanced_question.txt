<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, implements a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer with the following interface specifications. All ports are defined with specific bit widths and naming conventions:

- Input Ports:
  - `input [15:0] a`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] b`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] c`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] d`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] e`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] f`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] g`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] h`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [15:0] i`  : 16-bit input
  - `input [3:0] sel` : 4-bit selector input where `sel[3]` is the most significant bit and `sel[0]` is the least significant bit.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [15:0] out`: 16-bit output, where `out[15]` is the most significant bit and `out[0]` is the least significant bit.

Functional Description:
- The module functions as a multiplexer, selecting one of the nine 16-bit inputs (`a` to `i`) based on the 4-bit selector input `sel`.
- The selection mapping is as follows:
  - `sel = 4'b0000` selects `a`
  - `sel = 4'b0001` selects `b`
  - `sel = 4'b0010` selects `c`
  - `sel = 4'b0011` selects `d`
  - `sel = 4'b0100` selects `e`
  - `sel = 4'b0101` selects `f`
  - `sel = 4'b0110` selects `g`
  - `sel = 4'b0111` selects `h`
  - `sel = 4'b1000` selects `i`
- For `sel` values from `4'b1001` to `4'b1111`, the output `out` should be set to all bits '1' (`16'b1111111111111111`).

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that the `sel` is correctly interpreted as a 4-bit unsigned integer for proper selection.
- Outputs for unused `sel` values (9 to 15) are explicitly defined to avoid unintended behavior.

The module does not include any internal state or sequential logic, and therefore, it does not require any clock or reset signals.
