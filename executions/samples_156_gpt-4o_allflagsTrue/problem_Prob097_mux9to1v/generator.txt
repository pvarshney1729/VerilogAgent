<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a 16-bit wide, 9-to-1 multiplexer. The module will have nine 16-bit inputs (`a` to `i`) and a 4-bit selector input (`sel`). The output (`out`) is also 16 bits wide. The selector determines which input is routed to the output. If the selector value is between 0 and 8, the corresponding input is selected. For selector values from 9 to 15, the output should be set to all ones (`16'b1111111111111111`).

The implementation will use a combinational `always @(*)` block with a `case` statement to handle the selection logic. This approach ensures that the output is updated whenever any of the inputs or the selector changes. The `default` case in the `case` statement will handle the unused selector values by setting the output to all ones.

We will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all ports and signals, and we will use sized numeric constants for clarity. Since this is a purely combinational logic module, there is no need for a clock or reset signal.
