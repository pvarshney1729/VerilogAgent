Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in`: 1-bit input signal. The input is treated as an unsigned bit.
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: 1-bit output signal. The output is treated as an unsigned bit.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational NOT gate.
- The output `out` is the logical negation of the input `in`.

Additional Details:
- Bit Indexing Convention: `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- Since this is a combinational logic design, there are no clock cycles involved, and the module does not contain any sequential elements or registers.
- There are no resets needed as the module does not store any state.
- The operation of NOT is defined as: `out = ~in`, where `~` denotes the bitwise NOT operation.
- Behavior is consistent for all possible input values of `in` (i.e., 0 or 1).
