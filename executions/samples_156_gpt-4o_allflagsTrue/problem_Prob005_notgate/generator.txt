The task is to implement a simple NOT gate using Verilog. The module is named `TopModule` and has one input port `in` and one output port `out`, both of which are 1-bit wide. The NOT gate functionality is achieved by using the bitwise NOT operator `~` in Verilog. The output `out` is assigned the negation of the input `in` using a continuous assignment statement. This is a straightforward combinational logic implementation, so there is no need for an always block or any sequential logic elements. The guidelines and coding conventions provided do not apply to this simple combinational logic design, as there is no need for synchronous reset, clocking, or flip-flops.
