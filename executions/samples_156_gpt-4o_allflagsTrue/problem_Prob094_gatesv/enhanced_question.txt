Module Name: `TopModule`

Interface Description:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [3:0] in`: A 4-bit input vector where `in[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `output [3:0] out_both`: A 4-bit output vector indicating pairwise logical AND results with left neighbors.
  - `output [3:0] out_any`: A 4-bit output vector indicating pairwise logical OR results with right neighbors.
  - `output [3:0] out_different`: A 4-bit output vector indicating pairwise inequality with left neighbors, considering wrap-around for `in[3]`.

Functional Specification:

1. `out_both` Calculation:
   - `out_both[2:0]` indicates whether both the corresponding input bit and its left neighbor (higher index) are '1'.
     - `out_both[2] = in[2] & in[3]`
     - `out_both[1] = in[1] & in[2]`
     - `out_both[0] = in[0] & in[1]`
   - `out_both[3]` is not used and should be set to 0.

2. `out_any` Calculation:
   - `out_any[3:1]` indicates whether any of the corresponding input bit and its right neighbor (lower index) are '1'.
     - `out_any[3] = in[3] | in[2]`
     - `out_any[2] = in[2] | in[1]`
     - `out_any[1] = in[1] | in[0]`
   - `out_any[0]` is not used and should be set to 0.

3. `out_different` Calculation:
   - `out_different[3:0]` indicates whether the corresponding input bit is different from its left neighbor, with wrap-around consideration.
     - `out_different[3] = in[3] ^ in[0]`
     - `out_different[2] = in[2] ^ in[3]`
     - `out_different[1] = in[1] ^ in[2]`
     - `out_different[0] = in[0] ^ in[1]`

Clocking and Reset:
- This module operates purely on combinational logic, with no dependency on clock cycles or reset signals.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- Ensure all unused output bits (`out_both[3]` and `out_any[0]`) are explicitly set to 0 to prevent undefined behavior.
