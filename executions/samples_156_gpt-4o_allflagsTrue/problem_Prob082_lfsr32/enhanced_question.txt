Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal (positive edge-triggered)
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high signal for synchronous reset

- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 32-bit output vector representing the current state of the LFSR

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- The LFSR shifts to the right on each positive edge of the `clk`.
- The taps are located at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0 (0-indexed, where bit[0] is the least significant bit).
- For a given clock cycle:
  - Bit position 0 (LSB) is XORed with the bits at tap positions to determine the new value of bit position 31 (MSB).
  - Non-tap positions simply shift the value from the previous position.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset operation is synchronous with the clock.
- When `reset` is asserted (high) on a positive clock edge, the output `q` is set to the initial state of 32'h00000001.
- Resetting ensures that the LFSR starts in a known state.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, all bits of `q` are initialized to 0, except bit[0], which is set to 1.

Operational Details:
- On every positive edge of `clk`, if `reset` is not asserted, the LFSR updates its state based on the described Galois LFSR logic.
- If `reset` is asserted, the LFSR state is reset synchronously to the defined initial condition.

Signal and Operation Precedence:
- The shifting and XOR operations occur in the specified sequence, with the XOR of taps and LSB determining the new MSB.

Edge Cases:
- No special handling is necessary at the boundaries of the register as all operations are contained within the 32-bit width.

Note:
- Bit indexing follows a 0-index convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit and bit[31] is the most significant bit.
