Module Name: TopModule

Input/Output Port Specifications:
- Input: `in` - a 1024-bit wide vector input. This input is used to represent 256 separate 4-bit wide input values. The indexing convention for this vector is such that bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.
- Input: `sel` - an 8-bit wide input vector. This is used to select one of the 256 input groups of 4 bits from the `in` vector. Note that `sel` is an unsigned integer.
- Output: `out` - a 4-bit wide vector output. The output provides the selected 4-bit value from the `in` input vector based on the `sel` input.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 256-to-1 multiplexer, where each selected input group consists of 4 bits. 
- The relationship between the `sel` value and the `in` input vector is defined as follows:
  - When `sel` = 0, `out` should be assigned the value of `in[3:0]`.
  - When `sel` = 1, `out` should be assigned the value of `in[7:4]`.
  - When `sel` = 2, `out` should be assigned the value of `in[11:8]`.
  - This pattern continues such that when `sel` = N, `out` is assigned the value of `in[(4*N+3):(4*N)]`.

Operational Considerations:
- The module operates purely combinationally. There are no clocked elements, flip-flops, or registers within this module.
- There are no reset conditions as all operations are combinational.
- Ensure that the indexing and selection logic correctly maps each `sel` value to its corresponding 4-bit segment in the `in` vector.
- All signal dependencies are combinational, and thus there are no concerns of race conditions within this module.

Edge Cases:
- The `sel` input should always be within the range 0 to 255 inclusive. Values outside this range are not defined within this specification.
- The implementation assumes that all bits in the `in` vector are correctly defined and valid at the time of selection.
