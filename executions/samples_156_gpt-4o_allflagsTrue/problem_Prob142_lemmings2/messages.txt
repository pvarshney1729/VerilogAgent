Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input  clk: Clock signal for sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.\n- input  areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active high, resets the Lemming to walk left.\n- input  bump_left: Indicates an obstacle on the left, active high.\n- input  bump_right: Indicates an obstacle on the right, active high.\n- input  ground: Indicates the presence of ground, active high.\n- output walk_left: Indicates the Lemming is walking left, active high.\n- output walk_right: Indicates the Lemming is walking right, active high.\n- output aaah: Indicates the Lemming is falling, active high.\n\nPort Conventions:\n- All ports are 1-bit wide.\n- bit[0] refers to the least significant bit where applicable.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with three primary states:\n  1. WALK_LEFT: Lemming is walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0).\n  2. WALK_RIGHT: Lemming is walking right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1, aaah = 0).\n  3. FALLING: Lemming is falling (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 0, aaah = 1).\n\nTransition Logic:\n- From WALK_LEFT:\n  - Transition to WALK_RIGHT on (bump_left = 1).\n  - Transition to FALLING on (ground = 0).\n- From WALK_RIGHT:\n  - Transition to WALK_LEFT on (bump_right = 1).\n  - Transition to FALLING on (ground = 0).\n- From FALLING:\n  - Return to previous walking direction on (ground = 1). If previous state was WALK_LEFT, return to WALK_LEFT; if it was WALK_RIGHT, return to WALK_RIGHT.\n\nSpecial Conditions:\n- If both bump_left and bump_right are 1 simultaneously, the Lemming will switch directions.\n- Being bumped while in the FALLING state does not affect the Lemming\u2019s direction upon regaining ground.\n- If bump and ground change concurrently, the ground state change takes precedence.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On areset, the FSM resets to WALK_LEFT regardless of current state or input conditions.\n\nClock Domain Considerations:\n- All state transitions and output signal updates are synchronized to the positive edge of clk.\n- Ensure all sequential logic elements are initialized to predefined states on reset.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- Input transitions are handled synchronously except for the asynchronous reset.\n- Conflicting inputs (bump_left and bump_right both active) default to direction reversal.\n- Behavior is deterministic upon recovery from the asynchronous reset, favoring WALK_LEFT.\n\nInitial Values:\n- Upon reset, walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of a Moore state machine to model the behavior of a Lemming in the game. The module has been designed with the following considerations:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The FSM has four states: `WALK_LEFT`, `WALK_RIGHT`, `FALL_LEFT`, and `FALL_RIGHT`. These states are encoded using a 2-bit logic vector.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The state transitions are determined by the inputs `bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground`. The Lemming switches directions when bumped and falls when there is no ground. The transitions are handled in a combinational `always` block.\n\n3. **Asynchronous Reset**: The FSM is reset asynchronously to the `WALK_LEFT` state when `areset` is high. This is implemented in a sequential `always_ff` block that is sensitive to both `clk` and `areset`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The outputs `walk_left`, `walk_right`, and `aaah` are determined based on the current state.
