<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` is based on a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of a Lemming in the game. The FSM has four states: `WALK_LEFT`, `WALK_RIGHT`, `FALL_LEFT`, and `FALL_RIGHT`. The states are encoded using a 2-bit logic type `state_t`.

1. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM transitions between states based on the inputs `bump_left`, `bump_right`, and `ground`. The transitions are defined as follows:
   - From `WALK_LEFT`: If `ground` is 0, transition to `FALL_LEFT`. If `bump_left` is 1, transition to `WALK_RIGHT`. Otherwise, remain in `WALK_LEFT`.
   - From `WALK_RIGHT`: If `ground` is 0, transition to `FALL_RIGHT`. If `bump_right` is 1, transition to `WALK_LEFT`. Otherwise, remain in `WALK_RIGHT`.
   - From `FALL_LEFT`: If `ground` is 1, transition back to `WALK_LEFT`. Otherwise, remain in `FALL_LEFT`.
   - From `FALL_RIGHT`: If `ground` is 1, transition back to `WALK_RIGHT`. Otherwise, remain in `FALL_RIGHT`.

2. **State Register with Asynchronous Reset**: The state register is updated on the positive edge of the clock or when `areset` is asserted. When `areset` is high, the FSM resets to the `WALK_LEFT` state.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs `walk_left`, `walk_right`, and `aaah` are determined by the current state:
   - `walk_left` is high when the state is `WALK_LEFT`.
   - `walk_right` is high when the state is `WALK_RIGHT`.
   - `aaah` is high when the state is either `FALL_LEFT` or `FALL_RIGHT`.

The design adheres to the provided interface and coding conventions, ensuring that the FSM behaves as specified in the problem statement.
