Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input  clk: Clock signal for sequential logic, positive edge-triggered.
- input  areset: Asynchronous reset signal, active high, resets the Lemming to walk left.
- input  bump_left: Indicates an obstacle on the left, active high.
- input  bump_right: Indicates an obstacle on the right, active high.
- input  ground: Indicates the presence of ground, active high.
- output walk_left: Indicates the Lemming is walking left, active high.
- output walk_right: Indicates the Lemming is walking right, active high.
- output aaah: Indicates the Lemming is falling, active high.

Port Conventions:
- All ports are 1-bit wide.
- bit[0] refers to the least significant bit where applicable.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with three primary states:
  1. WALK_LEFT: Lemming is walking left (walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0).
  2. WALK_RIGHT: Lemming is walking right (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1, aaah = 0).
  3. FALLING: Lemming is falling (walk_left = 0, walk_right = 0, aaah = 1).

Transition Logic:
- From WALK_LEFT:
  - Transition to WALK_RIGHT on (bump_left = 1).
  - Transition to FALLING on (ground = 0).
- From WALK_RIGHT:
  - Transition to WALK_LEFT on (bump_right = 1).
  - Transition to FALLING on (ground = 0).
- From FALLING:
  - Return to previous walking direction on (ground = 1). If previous state was WALK_LEFT, return to WALK_LEFT; if it was WALK_RIGHT, return to WALK_RIGHT.

Special Conditions:
- If both bump_left and bump_right are 1 simultaneously, the Lemming will switch directions.
- Being bumped while in the FALLING state does not affect the Lemmingâ€™s direction upon regaining ground.
- If bump and ground change concurrently, the ground state change takes precedence.

Reset Behavior:
- On areset, the FSM resets to WALK_LEFT regardless of current state or input conditions.

Clock Domain Considerations:
- All state transitions and output signal updates are synchronized to the positive edge of clk.
- Ensure all sequential logic elements are initialized to predefined states on reset.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- Input transitions are handled synchronously except for the asynchronous reset.
- Conflicting inputs (bump_left and bump_right both active) default to direction reversal.
- Behavior is deterministic upon recovery from the asynchronous reset, favoring WALK_LEFT.

Initial Values:
- Upon reset, walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0.
