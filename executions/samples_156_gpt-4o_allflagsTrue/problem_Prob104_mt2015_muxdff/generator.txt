<REASONING>
The task is to create a submodule named `TopModule` that will be used in a hierarchical design. This submodule should include a flip-flop and a 2:1 multiplexer. The multiplexer selects between two inputs (`q_in` and `r_in`) based on a control signal (`L`). The selected input is then stored in a flip-flop on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`).

1. **Interface Definition**: The module has four inputs (`clk`, `L`, `q_in`, `r_in`) and one output (`Q`). All are single-bit signals.

2. **Multiplexer Logic**: The multiplexer selects `r_in` when `L` is high and `q_in` when `L` is low. This is implemented using an `if-else` statement inside an `always` block.

3. **Flip-Flop Logic**: The `always` block is triggered on the rising edge of `clk`, ensuring that the flip-flop captures the selected input at the correct time.

4. **Coding Conventions**: 
   - All ports and signals are declared as `logic` to adhere to modern SystemVerilog conventions.
   - The `always` block is used for sequential logic with `posedge clk` to ensure synchronous operation.
   - No reset logic is included as it was not specified in the original requirements.

5. **Hierarchical Design**: This module is designed to be instantiated multiple times in a larger module (e.g., `full_module`), allowing for a scalable and modular design approach.
