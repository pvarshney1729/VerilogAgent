Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The goal is to create a submodule named \"TopModule\" which will be used within a parent module called \"full_module\". This submodule will incorporate a flip-flop and a 2:1 multiplexer. The submodule should adhere to the following refined specifications:\n\n1. **Module Name**: `TopModule`\n\n2. **Interface Description**:\n   - **Inputs**:\n     - `input clk`: A clock signal for sequential logic. The clock signal should trigger operations on the rising edge.\n     - `input L`: A control signal for the multiplexer. It determines whether to load new data or perform feedback.\n     - `input q_in`: Data input for the flip-flop, representing the feedback path.\n     - `input r_in`: Data input from an external source, representing the parallel load path.\n   - **Output**:\n     - `output Q`: The output of the flip-flop, representing the stored bit value.\n\n3. **Bit Width**:\n   - All input and output ports are single-bit (`1-bit`) wide, as specified.\n\n4. **Combinational and Sequential Logic**:\n   - This module should implement a 2:1 multiplexer and a flip-flop.\n   - The multiplexer selects between `r_in` and `q_in` based on the `L` control signal:\n     - If `L` = 1, the multiplexer outputs `r_in`.\n     - If `L` = 0, the multiplexer outputs `q_in`.\n   - The flip-flop should capture the output of the multiplexer on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n5. **Reset Behavior**:\n   - The specification does not mention a reset signal; hence, the flip-flop does not include a reset mechanism within this submodule. Ensure the parent module handles any necessary initialization or reset logic externally.\n\n6. **Operation Precedence and Signal Dependency**:\n   - The output `Q` is updated with the value selected by the multiplexer on each rising edge of `clk`.\n\n7. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - As all operations involve single-bit signals, ensure that all logical operations handle 0 and 1 values correctly. The design should be robust against any input combination of `L`, `q_in`, and `r_in`.\n\nBy following this specification, the `TopModule` can be instantiated three times in the `full_module` to handle the three-bit-wide operations described in the original design context.\n                    "
