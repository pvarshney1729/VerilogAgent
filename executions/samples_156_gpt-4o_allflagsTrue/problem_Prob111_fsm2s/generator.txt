<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and specifications provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `reset`, `j`, `k`, and output `out`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **State Encoding**: Two states are defined using local parameters `OFF` and `ON`, each represented by a single bit (`1'b0` and `1'b1`, respectively).

3. **State Registers**: Two logic variables, `state` and `next_state`, are declared to hold the current and next state of the state machine.

4. **Synchronous State Transition Logic**: An `always` block is used to update the `state` on the rising edge of the `clk`. If `reset` is high, the state is set to `OFF`. Otherwise, the state is updated to `next_state`.

5. **Next State Logic**: A combinational `always` block (`always @(*)`) is used to determine the `next_state` based on the current `state` and inputs `j` and `k`. The transitions are implemented as per the state diagram:
   - From `OFF`, if `j` is 1, transition to `ON`; otherwise, stay in `OFF`.
   - From `ON`, if `k` is 1, transition to `OFF`; otherwise, stay in `ON`.

6. **Output Logic**: Another combinational `always` block is used to set the output `out` based on the current `state`. The output is 0 in the `OFF` state and 1 in the `ON` state.

7. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves as a Moore state machine with the specified state transitions and output logic.
