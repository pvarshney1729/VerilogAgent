Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, is to be implemented as follows. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:\n\n- `input clk`: This is the clock signal for the module, and it is used to synchronize all sequential operations. The rising edge of this clock signal triggers state transitions.\n- `input reset`: This is an active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted (i.e., reset = 1) on the rising edge of the clock, the state machine is reset to the initial state, OFF.\n- `input j`: This input signal influences state transitions when the state machine is in the OFF state.\n- `input k`: This input signal influences state transitions when the state machine is in the ON state.\n- `output reg out`: This is the output of the state machine. It is a registered output and represents the current state of the machine.\n\nThe state machine is a Moore state machine with two states, defined as follows:\n\n1. `OFF` state: \n   - `out = 0`\n   - Transitions:\n     - If `j = 0`, remain in the OFF state.\n     - If `j = 1`, transition to the ON state.\n\n2. `ON` state:\n   - `out = 1`\n   - Transitions:\n     - If `k = 0`, remain in the ON state.\n     - If `k = 1`, transition to the OFF state.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All signals are 1-bit wide; hence, no indexing is required.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset signal is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the rising edge of the clock. When asserted, it resets the state machine to the OFF state.\n\nInitial State:\n- Upon reset, the state machine enters the OFF state, and `out` is set to 0.\n\nThis module ensures that all state transitions are dependent on the rising edge of the `clk` signal, and the output `out` is determined solely based on the current state, consistent with Moore machine design principles.\n                    "

Otherwise, the state is updated to the next state.\n\n4. **Next State Logic**: This is a combinational logic block that determines the next state based on the current state and inputs j and k. It uses a case statement to handle the transitions:\n   - In the OFF state, if j is 1, transition to ON; otherwise, stay in OFF.\n   - In the ON state, if k is 1, transition to OFF; otherwise, stay in ON.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: This is another combinational logic block that sets the output based on the current state. In the OFF state, the output is 0, and in the ON state, the output is 1.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the Moore machine principles and the provided specifications.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    localparam logic OFF = 1'b0;\n    localparam logic ON  = 1'b1;\n\n    // State registers\n    logic state, next_state;\n\n    // Synchronous state transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            state <= OFF;\n        end else begin\n            state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            OFF: begin\n                if (j) begin\n                    next_state = ON;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = OFF;\n                end\n            end\n            ON: begin\n                if (k) begin\n                    next_state = OFF;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = ON;\n                end\n            end\n            default: next_state = OFF;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            OFF: out = 1'b0;\n            ON:  out = 1'b1;\n            default: out = 1'b0;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and specifications provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `reset`, `j`, `k`, and output `out`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **State Encoding**: Two states are defined using local parameters `OFF` and `ON`, each represented by a single bit (`1'b0` and `1'b1`, respectively).\n\n3. **State Registers**: Two logic variables, `state` and `next_state`, are declared to hold the current and next state of the state machine.\n\n4. **Synchronous State Transition Logic**: An `always` block is used to update the `state` on the rising edge of the `clk`. If `reset` is high, the state is set to `OFF`. Otherwise, the state is updated to `next_state`.\n\n5. **Next State Logic**: A combinational `always` block (`always @(*)`) is used to determine the `next_state` based on the current `state` and inputs `j` and `k`. The transitions are implemented as per the state diagram:\n   - From `OFF`, if `j` is 1, transition to `ON`; otherwise, stay in `OFF`.\n   - From `ON`, if `k` is 1, transition to `OFF`; otherwise, stay in `ON`.\n\n6. **Output Logic**: Another combinational `always` block is used to set the output `out` based on the current `state`. The output is 0 in the `OFF` state and 1 in the `ON` state.\n\n7. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the module behaves as a Moore state machine with the specified state transitions and output logic.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    localparam logic OFF = 1'b0;\n    localparam logic ON  = 1'b1;\n\n    // State registers\n    logic state, next_state;\n\n    // Synchronous state transition logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            state <= OFF;\n        end else begin\n            state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            OFF: begin\n                if (j) begin\n                    next_state = ON;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = OFF;\n                end\n            end\n            ON: begin\n                if (k) begin\n                    next_state = OFF;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = ON;\n                end\n            end\n            default: next_state = OFF;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            OFF: out = 1'b0;\n            ON:  out = 1'b1;\n            default: out = 1'b0;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
