The module, named `TopModule`, is to be implemented as follows. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified:

- `input clk`: This is the clock signal for the module, and it is used to synchronize all sequential operations. The rising edge of this clock signal triggers state transitions.
- `input reset`: This is an active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted (i.e., reset = 1) on the rising edge of the clock, the state machine is reset to the initial state, OFF.
- `input j`: This input signal influences state transitions when the state machine is in the OFF state.
- `input k`: This input signal influences state transitions when the state machine is in the ON state.
- `output reg out`: This is the output of the state machine. It is a registered output and represents the current state of the machine.

The state machine is a Moore state machine with two states, defined as follows:

1. `OFF` state: 
   - `out = 0`
   - Transitions:
     - If `j = 0`, remain in the OFF state.
     - If `j = 1`, transition to the ON state.

2. `ON` state:
   - `out = 1`
   - Transitions:
     - If `k = 0`, remain in the ON state.
     - If `k = 1`, transition to the OFF state.

Bit Indexing:
- All signals are 1-bit wide; hence, no indexing is required.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous, meaning it is sampled on the rising edge of the clock. When asserted, it resets the state machine to the OFF state.

Initial State:
- Upon reset, the state machine enters the OFF state, and `out` is set to 0.

This module ensures that all state transitions are dependent on the rising edge of the `clk` signal, and the output `out` is determined solely based on the current state, consistent with Moore machine design principles.
