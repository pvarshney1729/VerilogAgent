The task is to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a specific interface and functionality. The module has a 3-bit input vector `vec` and outputs the same vector as `outv`. Additionally, it splits the input vector into three separate 1-bit outputs: `o0`, `o1`, and `o2`. Each of these outputs corresponds to a specific bit position in the input vector. The implementation is straightforward as it involves direct assignments without any complex logic or state elements. The use of `logic` for port declarations is in line with modern Verilog practices, and the assignments are done using continuous assignment statements (`assign`), which are suitable for combinational logic.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [2:0] vec,
    output logic [2:0] outv,
    output logic o2,
    output logic o1,
    output logic o0
);

    // Assign the input vector to the output vector
    assign outv = vec;

    // Split the input vector into individual bits
    assign o0 = vec[0];
    assign o1 = vec[1];
    assign o2 = vec[2];

endmodule
