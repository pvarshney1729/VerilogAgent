Module Definitions:

1. Module A:
   - Implements the boolean function: z_A = (x_A ^ y_A) & x_A
   - Inputs:
     - x_A: 1-bit input, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.
     - y_A: 1-bit input, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.
   - Output:
     - z_A: 1-bit output, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.

2. Module B:
   - Behavior defined by waveform:
     - Inputs:
       - x_B: 1-bit input, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.
       - y_B: 1-bit input, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.
     - Output:
       - z_B: 1-bit output, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.
     - Output follows the given simulation waveform, with changes occurring at discrete time intervals (5ns steps):
       - For example, at time 0ns to 20ns, z_B = 1 when x_B = 0 and y_B = 0.

Top-Level Module:

- Inputs:
  - x: 1-bit input, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.
  - y: 1-bit input, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.

- Output:
  - z: 1-bit output, interpreted as an unsigned binary value.

- Internal Connections:
  - The first A submodule:
    - Connect inputs as x_A1 = x and y_A1 = y.
    - Output z_A1 connected to the first input of a 2-input OR gate.
  - The first B submodule:
    - Connect inputs as x_B1 = x and y_B1 = y.
    - Output z_B1 connected to the second input of the 2-input OR gate.
  - The OR gate output provides an intermediate signal, OR_out.
  
  - The second A submodule:
    - Connect inputs as x_A2 = x and y_A2 = y.
    - Output z_A2 connected to the first input of a 2-input AND gate.
  - The second B submodule:
    - Connect inputs as x_B2 = x and y_B2 = y.
    - Output z_B2 connected to the second input of the 2-input AND gate.
  - The AND gate output provides an intermediate signal, AND_out.

- Final Output Logic:
  - An XOR gate receives OR_out and AND_out as inputs.
  - The output of the XOR gate is connected to the top-level output z.

Signal Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are interpreted as unsigned binary values with bit[0] as the least significant bit.
- Ensure all combinational logic elements (OR, AND, XOR) are correctly synchronized with input changes without introducing delay elements, as this is purely combinational logic.
