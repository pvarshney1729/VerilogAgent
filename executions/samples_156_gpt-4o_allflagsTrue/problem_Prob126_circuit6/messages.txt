Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Specification for Module: TopModule\n\n1. Module Interface:\n   - Input Ports:\n     - `a`: 3-bit wide input vector. Each bit is denoted as `a[2:0]` where `a[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `a[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n   - Output Ports:\n     - `q`: 16-bit wide output vector.\n\n2. Circuit Type:\n   - The module implements a purely combinational logic circuit with no sequential elements or clock dependencies.\n\n3. Functionality:\n   - The output `q` is determined solely by the input `a` based on the provided mapping:\n     - When `a` is 3'b000, `q` outputs 16'h1232.\n     - When `a` is 3'b001, `q` outputs 16'haee0.\n     - When `a` is 3'b010, `q` outputs 16'h27d4.\n     - When `a` is 3'b011, `q` outputs 16'h5a0e.\n     - When `a` is 3'b100, `q` outputs 16'h2066.\n     - When `a` is 3'b101, `q` outputs 16'h64ce.\n     - When `a` is 3'b110, `q` outputs 16'hc526.\n     - When `a` is 3'b111, `q` outputs 16'h2f19.\n\n4. Special Considerations:\n   - The output `q` is undefined for input values outside the range of 3'b000 to 3'b111.\n   - There are no reset conditions or initial states required for this combinational circuit.\n   - The output `q` should change immediately in response to any change in input `a`, as it is a combinational circuit.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n   - Ensure that the circuit behavior strictly follows the specified mapping for each valid input value of `a`.\n   - The circuit should not introduce any delays or race conditions, given that it is purely combinational.\n\nNote: All hexadecimal values are assumed to be in lower case as per the given specification.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe task is to implement a combinational logic circuit that maps a 3-bit input `a` to a 16-bit output `q` based on a predefined set of values. The mapping is derived from the simulation waveforms provided. Since the circuit is purely combinational, we use an `always @(*)` block to describe the behavior, which ensures that the output `q` is updated immediately whenever the input `a` changes. The `case` statement is used to map each possible value of `a` to its corresponding output `q`. The default case handles any undefined states, although in this specific scenario, all 3-bit combinations are covered.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic [2:0] a,\n    output logic [15:0] q\n);\n\nalways @(*) begin\n    case (a)\n        3'b000: q = 16'h1232;\n        3'b001: q = 16'haee0;\n        3'b010: q = 16'h27d4;\n        3'b011: q = 16'h5a0e;\n        3'b100: q = 16'h2066;\n        3'b101: q = 16'h64ce;\n        3'b110: q = 16'hc526;\n        3'b111: q = 16'h2f19;\n        default: q = 16'hxxxx; // Undefined for values outside 0-7\n    endcase\nend\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
