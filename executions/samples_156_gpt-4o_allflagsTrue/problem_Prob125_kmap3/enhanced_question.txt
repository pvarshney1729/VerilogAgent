Module Specification for TopModule:

Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: 1-bit input signal.
  - input wire b: 1-bit input signal.
  - input wire c: 1-bit input signal.
  - input wire d: 1-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out: 1-bit output signal.

Karnaugh Map Implementation:
- The module implements the following functionality based on the Karnaugh map provided:
  
  |      ab       |
  | cd | 01 | 00 | 10 | 11 |
  |----|----|----|----|----|
  | 00 |  d |  0 |  1 |  1 |
  | 01 |  0 |  0 |  d |  d |
  | 11 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
  | 10 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |

- 'd' in the Karnaugh map represents a don't-care condition, where the output can be either 0 or 1, depending on what is more convenient or optimal for minimizing logic.

Inputs and Outputs:
- The input signals (a, b, c, d) are treated as binary variables where:
  - 'a' and 'b' together form a 2-bit binary number representing the columns of the Karnaugh map.
  - 'c' and 'd' together form a 2-bit binary number representing the rows of the Karnaugh map.

- The output 'out' is determined by the values of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' according to the Karnaugh map specified above.

Operational Details:
- The module should be implemented using combinational logic only, as there are no sequential elements or clocked operations specified.

- Ensure that the logic minimizes the use of gates and optimizes for the don't-care conditions ('d') where applicable.

- The output 'out' should reflect the correct logic level based on the specified Karnaugh map in all valid combinations of inputs.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- All possible combinations of the inputs (a, b, c, and d) should be accounted for, including all don't-care conditions.

- The implementation should be robust to handle any input values, ensuring that the output is consistent with the specified logic.
