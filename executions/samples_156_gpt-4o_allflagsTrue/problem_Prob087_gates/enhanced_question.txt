Module Name: TopModule

Description:
- This module implements a combinational logic circuit with two single-bit inputs and seven single-bit outputs, each representing a different logic operation.

Port Definitions:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a: Single-bit input, where bit[0] is the least significant bit.
  - input wire b: Single-bit input, where bit[0] is the least significant bit.

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out_and: Single-bit output, representing the logical AND of inputs a and b.
  - output wire out_or: Single-bit output, representing the logical OR of inputs a and b.
  - output wire out_xor: Single-bit output, representing the logical XOR of inputs a and b.
  - output wire out_nand: Single-bit output, representing the logical NAND of inputs a and b.
  - output wire out_nor: Single-bit output, representing the logical NOR of inputs a and b.
  - output wire out_xnor: Single-bit output, representing the logical XNOR of inputs a and b.
  - output wire out_anotb: Single-bit output, representing the logical AND of input a and the logical NOT of input b.

Functional Description:
- The module is purely combinational with no clock or reset signals involved.
- Each output performs a distinct logic operation on the inputs a and b, as follows:

  1. out_and = a & b
  2. out_or = a | b
  3. out_xor = a ^ b
  4. out_nand = ~(a & b)
  5. out_nor = ~(a | b)
  6. out_xnor = ~(a ^ b)
  7. out_anotb = a & ~b

- The module does not exhibit stateful behavior, hence no initialization or sequential logic is required.
- The operations are evaluated within a single clock cycle, assuming zero propagation delay for theoretical purposes.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- As the inputs are single-bit, the module handles all possible binary combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) of a and b.
- The outputs will reflect the correct logical operation for each combination without race conditions.

Note:
- Ensure that the input connections to the module respect the single-bit width constraint.
