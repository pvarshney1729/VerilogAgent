Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal triggering sequential logic on the positive edge.
- input wire reset: Active-high, synchronous reset signal. When asserted, all state elements are reset to their initial state.
- input wire data: Input bit stream to be monitored for the sequence.
- output reg start_shifting: Output signal set high upon detection of the sequence 1101, remains high until reset.

Specifications:
1. The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence '1101' in the input bit stream 'data'.
2. The FSM shall transition through states that represent partial matches of the sequence '1101'. These states include:
   - Initial state (IDLE): No match yet.
   - State S1: Detected '1'.
   - State S2: Detected '11'.
   - State S3: Detected '110'.
   - State S4: Detected '1101'.

3. State Transitions:
   - From IDLE, move to S1 if input 'data' is '1'.
   - From S1, move to S2 if input 'data' is '1', otherwise return to IDLE.
   - From S2, move to S3 if input 'data' is '0', otherwise remain in S2.
   - From S3, move to S4 if input 'data' is '1', otherwise return to IDLE.
   - Remain in S4 indefinitely once reached, until reset is asserted.

4. Output Behavior:
   - The 'start_shifting' output is set to '1' upon reaching state S4.
   - 'start_shifting' remains '1' until a reset occurs.

5. Reset Behavior:
   - On the assertion of 'reset', the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is set to '0'.

6. Edge Cases:
   - If 'reset' is asserted during any state, the FSM transitions immediately to the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is cleared to '0'.
   - The reset signal is synchronous and must be asserted at the positive edge of 'clk' to take effect.

Note:
- All operations are assumed to have precedence from left to right unless parentheses dictate otherwise.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) in any multi-bit operations, though all ports are single-bit in this specification.
