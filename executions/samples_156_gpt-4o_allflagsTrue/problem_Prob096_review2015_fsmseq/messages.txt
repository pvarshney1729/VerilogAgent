Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal triggering sequential logic on the positive edge.\n- input wire reset: Active-high, synchronous reset signal. When asserted, all state elements are reset to their initial state.\n- input wire data: Input bit stream to be monitored for the sequence.\n- output reg start_shifting: Output signal set high upon detection of the sequence 1101, remains high until reset.\n\nSpecifications:\n1. The module implements a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence '1101' in the input bit stream 'data'.\n2. The FSM shall transition through states that represent partial matches of the sequence '1101'. These states include:\n   - Initial state (IDLE): No match yet.\n   - State S1: Detected '1'.\n   - State S2: Detected '11'.\n   - State S3: Detected '110'.\n   - State S4: Detected '1101'.\n\n3. State Transitions:\n   - From IDLE, move to S1 if input 'data' is '1'.\n   - From S1, move to S2 if input 'data' is '1', otherwise return to IDLE.\n   - From S2, move to S3 if input 'data' is '0', otherwise remain in S2.\n   - From S3, move to S4 if input 'data' is '1', otherwise return to IDLE.\n   - Remain in S4 indefinitely once reached, until reset is asserted.\n\n4. Output Behavior:\n   - The 'start_shifting' output is set to '1' upon reaching state S4.\n   - 'start_shifting' remains '1' until a reset occurs.\n\n5. Reset Behavior:\n   - On the assertion of 'reset', the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is set to '0'.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - If 'reset' is asserted during any state, the FSM transitions immediately to the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is cleared to '0'.\n   - The reset signal is synchronous and must be asserted at the positive edge of 'clk' to take effect.\n\nNote:\n- All operations are assumed to have precedence from left to right unless parentheses dictate otherwise.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) in any multi-bit operations, though all ports are single-bit in this specification.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows a structured approach to design a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence \"1101\" in an input bit stream. The FSM uses five states: IDLE, S1, S11, S110, and S1101. Each state represents the progress in detecting the sequence. The module transitions between these states based on the input data bit.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a `typedef enum` for clarity and ease of understanding. Each state is represented by a 3-bit value.\n\n2. **Sequential Logic**: The `always_ff` block handles the state transitions and the output logic. It is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset is implemented by checking the `reset` signal within the `always_ff` block. When `reset` is high, the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and `start_shifting` is set to 0.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The `start_shifting` signal is set to 1 when the FSM reaches the S1101 state, indicating that the sequence \"1101\" has been detected. Once set, `start_shifting` remains high until a reset occurs.\n\n4. **Combinational Logic**: The `always_comb` block determines the next state based on the current state and the input data. This block uses a `case` statement to handle the state transitions.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all ports and signals, and using `always_ff` and `always_comb` for sequential and combinational logic, respectively.\n\nOverall, the module is designed to efficiently detect the sequence \"1101\" and set the output `start_shifting` accordingly, with a synchronous reset to initialize the FSM.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input  logic clk,\n    input  logic reset,\n    input  logic data,\n    output logic start_shifting\n);\n\n    // State encoding using typedef enum\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE    = 3'b000,\n        S1      = 3'b001,\n        S11     = 3'b010,\n        S110    = 3'b011,\n        S1101   = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // Sequential logic for state transition and output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            start_shifting <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == S1101) begin\n                start_shifting <= 1'b1;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Combinational logic for next state determination\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE:   next_state = (data) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the module `TopModule`, we need to design a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in the input bit stream `data`. The FSM will have several states representing the progress of detecting the sequence. Once the sequence is detected, the output `start_shifting` should be set to `1` and remain `1` until a reset occurs.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define states using an enumerated type `state_t` with the following states:\n   - `IDLE`: Initial state, no bits detected.\n   - `S1`: Detected the first `1`.\n   - `S11`: Detected `11`.\n   - `S110`: Detected `110`.\n   - `S1101`: Detected `1101`, sequence complete.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: We use a sequential `always_ff` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to handle state transitions. If `reset` is asserted, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state, and `start_shifting` is cleared. Otherwise, the FSM transitions to the next state based on the current state and input `data`.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: A combinational `always_comb` block determines the next state based on the current state and input `data`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The `start_shifting` output is set to `1` when the FSM reaches the `S1101` state. It remains `1` until a reset occurs.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with respect to the clock. It is handled within the sequential `always_ff` block without including `reset` in the sensitivity list.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and not explicitly specifying the sensitivity list for combinational logic.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure the FSM correctly detects the sequence `1101` and sets `start_shifting` as required.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input  logic clk,\n    input  logic reset,\n    input  logic data,\n    output logic start_shifting\n);\n\n    // State encoding using typedef enum\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE    = 3'b000,\n        S1      = 3'b001,\n        S11     = 3'b010,\n        S110    = 3'b011,\n        S1101   = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // Sequential logic for state transition and output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            start_shifting <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == S1101) begin\n                start_shifting <= 1'b1;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Combinational logic for next state determination\n    always_comb begin\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE:   next_state = (data) ?
