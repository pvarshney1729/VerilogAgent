<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule`, we need to design a finite-state machine (FSM) that detects the sequence `1101` in the input bit stream `data`. The FSM will have several states representing the progress of detecting the sequence. Once the sequence is detected, the output `start_shifting` should be set to `1` and remain `1` until a reset occurs.

1. **State Encoding**: We define states using an enumerated type `state_t` with the following states:
   - `IDLE`: Initial state, no bits detected.
   - `S1`: Detected the first `1`.
   - `S11`: Detected `11`.
   - `S110`: Detected `110`.
   - `S1101`: Detected `1101`, sequence complete.

2. **State Transition Logic**: We use a sequential `always_ff` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to handle state transitions. If `reset` is asserted, the FSM returns to the `IDLE` state, and `start_shifting` is cleared. Otherwise, the FSM transitions to the next state based on the current state and input `data`.

3. **Next State Logic**: A combinational `always_comb` block determines the next state based on the current state and input `data`.

4. **Output Logic**: The `start_shifting` output is set to `1` when the FSM reaches the `S1101` state. It remains `1` until a reset occurs.

5. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset is synchronous, meaning it is sampled with respect to the clock. It is handled within the sequential `always_ff` block without including `reset` in the sensitivity list.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and not explicitly specifying the sensitivity list for combinational logic.

By following these steps, we ensure the FSM correctly detects the sequence `1101` and sets `start_shifting` as required.
