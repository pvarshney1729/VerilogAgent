<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a Verilog module that processes a 100-bit input vector and generates three 100-bit output vectors based on specific conditions. The outputs are determined by bitwise operations on the input vector and its neighbors. We will use combinational logic to achieve this, as there is no mention of sequential logic or clocked behavior in the specification.

1. **out_both**: This output checks if both the current bit and its left neighbor are '1'. Since `in[99]` has no left neighbor, `out_both[99]` is set to zero. For other bits, we perform a bitwise AND operation between `in[i]` and `in[i+1]`.

2. **out_any**: This output checks if either the current bit or its right neighbor is '1'. Since `in[0]` has no right neighbor, `out_any[0]` is set to zero. For other bits, we perform a bitwise OR operation between `in[i]` and `in[i-1]`.

3. **out_different**: This output checks if the current bit is different from its left neighbor. The vector is treated as circular, so `in[99]`'s left neighbor is `in[0]`. We use a bitwise XOR operation to determine if the bits are different.

We will use `assign` statements for combinational logic, as there is no need for sequential logic or a clock signal. The module will strictly follow the provided interface and signal names.
