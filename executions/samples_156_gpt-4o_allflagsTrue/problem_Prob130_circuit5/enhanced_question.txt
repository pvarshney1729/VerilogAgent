Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Inputs:
  - `input [3:0] a`: A 4-bit input signal.
  - `input [3:0] b`: A 4-bit input signal.
  - `input [3:0] c`: A 4-bit input signal.
  - `input [3:0] d`: A 4-bit input signal.
  - `input [3:0] e`: A 4-bit input signal.

- Output:
  - `output [3:0] q`: A 4-bit output signal.

Operational Details:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- Output `q` is determined based on the value of the input `c` as follows:
  - If `c == 4'b0000`, then `q = b`.
  - If `c == 4'b0001`, then `q = e`.
  - If `c == 4'b0010`, then `q = a`.
  - If `c == 4'b0011`, then `q = d`.
  - If `c >= 4'b0100` and `c <= 4'b1111`, then `q = 4'b1111`.
- There are no sequential elements, and the circuit is purely combinational.
- All operations are performed in a single cycle as there are no clocked elements.

Indexing Convention:
- All bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Edge Cases:
- For `c` values from `4'b0100` to `4'b1111`, `q` is always set to `4'b1111`.

Note:
- Ensure that the logic is optimized for a combinational implementation without any latches or flip-flops.
