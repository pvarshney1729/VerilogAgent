<REASONING>
The task is to implement a combinational circuit based on the given simulation waveforms. The output `q` is determined by the value of the input `c` as follows:
- When `c` is 0, `q` should be equal to `b`.
- When `c` is 1, `q` should be equal to `e`.
- When `c` is 2, `q` should be equal to `a`.
- When `c` is 3, `q` should be equal to `d`.
- For all other values of `c` (from 4 to 15), `q` should be set to `4'hf`.

The module is purely combinational, so we use an `always @(*)` block to describe the logic. The `case` statement is used to select the appropriate output based on the value of `c`. This approach ensures that the logic is clear and concise, adhering to the coding conventions provided.
