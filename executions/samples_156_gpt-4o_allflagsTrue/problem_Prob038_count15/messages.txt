        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input signal. The counter advances on the positive edge of this signal.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input. When high on the rising edge of `clk`, the counter will reset to 0.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `q`: 4-bit output representing the current count value. Bit[3] is the most significant bit (MSB), and bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15, inclusive, in a sequential manner. The counter operates with a period of 16 clock cycles.\n- All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The `reset` input is synchronous. During the positive edge of the `clk`, if the `reset` signal is high, the counter will be reset to 0.\n- The reset state of the counter is 0, which means `q` will output `0000` after a reset.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The counter increments by 1 on each positive edge of `clk`, provided that `reset` is not active.\n- Upon reaching the maximum count of 15 (`1111` in binary), the counter will wrap around to 0 on the next clock cycle.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If `reset` is high during the positive edge of `clk`, the counter will be set to 0 regardless of its current state.\n- The transition from 15 (`1111`) to 0 (`0000`) occurs seamlessly without requiring additional logic for wrap-around.\n\nInitial State:\n- Upon instantiation, before any clock cycles, the counter should be considered to be in a reset state, i.e., `q` should initially be `0000`.\n\nEnsure that the design handles all possible timing scenarios appropriately, avoiding race conditions and ensuring correct synchronous reset behavior.\n                    "
