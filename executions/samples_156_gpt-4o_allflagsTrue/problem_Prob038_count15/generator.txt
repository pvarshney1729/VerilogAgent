<REASONING>
To implement the 4-bit binary counter with a synchronous reset, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The input ports are `clk` and `reset`, both 1-bit signals. The output port `q` is a 4-bit signal.

2. **Signal Declaration**: Use a 4-bit logic signal `count` to hold the current value of the counter. This will be updated on each clock cycle.

3. **Sequential Logic**: Use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to implement the counter logic. Inside this block:
   - Check if the `reset` signal is high. If it is, set `count` to `4'b0000` to reset the counter.
   - If `reset` is not high, increment the `count` by 1. This will naturally wrap around from 15 to 0 due to the 4-bit width.

4. **Output Assignment**: Assign the value of `count` to the output `q`. This ensures that the output reflects the current count value.

5. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the specified coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring that the synchronous reset is implemented correctly without including `reset` in the sensitivity list.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specification requirements and adheres to the provided guidelines and conventions.
