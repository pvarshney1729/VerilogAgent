<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Output Port:
  - Name: zero
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Description: This output is a constant signal that always outputs a logical LOW (0).

Functional Specification:
- The output port 'zero' should consistently output a LOW value regardless of any other inputs or conditions.
- This module does not require any input ports, clock signals, or reset signals since its functionality is purely combinational and static.
- There are no sequential elements or state dependencies in this module.

Additional Clarifications:
- Ensure that 'zero' is always driven to 0, and no additional circuitry or logic is required.
- The output does not change over time or depend on any external conditions.
