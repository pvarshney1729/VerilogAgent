<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single output port `zero` that always outputs a LOW signal. Based on the guidelines and coding conventions provided, we need to ensure that the output is a constant value, which can be achieved using an `assign` statement. Since the module does not require any inputs or sequential logic, we will not use any `always` blocks or clock signals. The output will be declared using `logic` as per the coding conventions, and the constant value will be assigned directly.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic zero
);

    // Assign a constant LOW (0) to the output zero
    assign zero = 1'b0;

endmodule
[DONE]
