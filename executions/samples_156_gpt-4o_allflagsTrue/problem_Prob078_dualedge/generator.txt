<REASONING>
To implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using standard FPGA resources, we need to simulate the behavior of capturing data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock. Since FPGAs do not support dual-edge triggered flip-flops natively, we can achieve this by using two separate flip-flops: one triggered on the positive edge and the other on the negative edge of the clock. 

1. **Positive Edge Flip-Flop**: This captures the input `d` on the rising edge of the clock and stores it in `q_pos`.
2. **Negative Edge Flip-Flop**: This captures the input `d` on the falling edge of the clock and stores it in `q_neg`.
3. **Multiplexer Logic**: A combinational logic block is used to select between `q_pos` and `q_neg` based on the current state of the clock. If the clock is high, `q` will take the value of `q_pos`; if the clock is low, `q` will take the value of `q_neg`.

This approach effectively emulates a dual-edge triggered flip-flop by ensuring that the output `q` reflects the most recent value of `d` captured on either edge of the clock.

The implementation adheres to the provided guidelines and coding conventions:
- All ports and signals are declared as `logic`.
- Combinational logic uses `always @(*)` without an explicit sensitivity list.
- The design does not include a reset signal, as it was not specified in the original question.
- The module strictly follows the interface and signal names as specified.
