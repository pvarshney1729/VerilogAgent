<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Specification for Module: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input in`: 1-bit input signal
  - `input [3:0] state`: 4-bit input signal representing current state, using one-hot encoding

- Output Ports:
  - `output [3:0] next_state`: 4-bit output signal representing next state, using one-hot encoding
  - `output out`: 1-bit output signal

State Encoding:
- State A: 4'b0001
- State B: 4'b0010
- State C: 4'b0100
- State D: 4'b1000

State Transition Table and Output Logic:
- Current State A:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = A; `out` = 0
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B; `out` = 0

- Current State B:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = C; `out` = 0
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B; `out` = 0

- Current State C:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = A; `out` = 0
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = D; `out` = 0

- Current State D:
  - If `in` = 0, `next_state` = C; `out` = 1
  - If `in` = 1, `next_state` = B; `out` = 1

Design Considerations:
- Implement only the combinational logic for state transition and output, with no sequential elements.
- Ensure that the logic correctly interprets the one-hot encoding for state transitions.
- The `output out` reflects the Moore FSM output logic, determined solely by the current state, not by the input `in`.

Note:
- Ensure that the implementation adheres to the bit indexing where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[3] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).
- The module assumes ideal conditions where inputs are stable during evaluation of the combinational logic, with no race conditions present.
