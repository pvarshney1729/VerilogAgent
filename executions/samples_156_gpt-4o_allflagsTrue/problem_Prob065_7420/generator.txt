<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that replicates the functionality of the 7420 chip, which consists of two 4-input NAND gates. Each NAND gate takes four inputs and produces one output. The output is high (logic '1') unless all inputs are high, in which case the output is low (logic '0').

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is declared with the specified inputs and outputs. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **NAND Gate Implementation**: 
   - For the first NAND gate, the inputs are `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, and `p1d`, and the output is `p1y`. The logic operation is `p1y = ~(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d)`.
   - For the second NAND gate, the inputs are `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, and `p2d`, and the output is `p2y`. The logic operation is `p2y = ~(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d)`.

3. **Use of `assign` Statements**: Since the logic is purely combinational and does not require any sequential logic or state retention, `assign` statements are used to directly map the logic operations to the outputs.

4. **No Clock or Reset**: The module does not include any clock or reset signals, as it implements purely combinational logic.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The implementation adheres to the specified coding conventions, including the use of `logic` for port declarations and the use of `assign` statements for combinational logic.

This approach ensures that the module accurately replicates the behavior of the 7420 chip using Verilog.
