Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule is designed to replicate the functionality of the 7420 chip, which includes two 4-input NAND gates. This module will process two sets of four input signals each and produce two output signals, each representing the NAND operation on the respective set of inputs.

Ports:
- Inputs:
  - input wire p1a: First input for the first 4-input NAND gate.
  - input wire p1b: Second input for the first 4-input NAND gate.
  - input wire p1c: Third input for the first 4-input NAND gate.
  - input wire p1d: Fourth input for the first 4-input NAND gate.
  - input wire p2a: First input for the second 4-input NAND gate.
  - input wire p2b: Second input for the second 4-input NAND gate.
  - input wire p2c: Third input for the second 4-input NAND gate.
  - input wire p2d: Fourth input for the second 4-input NAND gate.

- Outputs:
  - output wire p1y: Result of the NAND operation on inputs p1a, p1b, p1c, and p1d.
  - output wire p2y: Result of the NAND operation on inputs p2a, p2b, p2c, and p2d.

Functional Details:
- The module contains two distinct 4-input NAND gates.
- For each 4-input NAND gate, the output is high (logic '1') except when all the inputs are high (logic '1'), in which case the output is low (logic '0').
- The outputs p1y and p2y are determined by the following logic equations:
  - p1y = !(p1a & p1b & p1c & p1d)
  - p2y = !(p2a & p2b & p2c & p2d)

Signal Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are 1-bit wide.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit and is the only bit used since they are single-bit signals.
- No clock or reset signals are involved as the module implements purely combinational logic.

Edge Cases:
- The output of each NAND gate will be '1' if any of the inputs are '0'.
- The output will be '0' only when all respective inputs are '1'.

The specification ensures the correct logical behavior of the 7420 chip's functionality within the TopModule using two 4-input NAND gate representations.
