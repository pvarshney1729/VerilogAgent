The module, named TopModule, is required to have the following interface. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all input and output ports are single-bit signals.

- `input  wire clk` : Clock input signal triggering on the positive edge.
- `input  wire reset` : Synchronous active-high reset signal that resets the counter to 0 when asserted.
- `input  wire slowena` : Control signal that enables the counter to increment when high.
- `output reg [3:0] q` : 4-bit output representing the current count value, with `q[3]` as the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).

The module should implement a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9 inclusive, with a complete cycle having a period of 10 clock cycles. This counter should only increment when the `slowena` input is high; otherwise, it retains its current state.

The reset signal is synchronous, meaning the counter will reset to 0 on the next positive clock edge if the reset is high. All sequential logic within the module is triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal.

Initial condition: On power-up or reset, the counter should be initialized to 0.

The counter's primary operation is as follows:
- On the rising edge of `clk`, if `reset` is high, the counter `q` is set to 0.
- If `reset` is low and `slowena` is high, the counter `q` increments by 1.
- If `reset` is low and `slowena` is low, the counter `q` maintains its current value.
- When the counter reaches 9, the next increment should wrap around the counter back to 0.

This design ensures predictable operation in all scenarios, including reset, enable, and normal counting sequences.
