Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- input wire aresetn: Asynchronous reset signal, active-low, triggered on the negative edge.
- input wire x: Input data bit for sequence detection.
- output reg z: Output signal, asserted to 1 when sequence "101" is detected.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- Type: Mealy-type FSM
- Number of States: 3
- State Encoding: Use 2-bit state encoding.

State Definitions:
1. STATE_0 (00): Initial state, waiting for the first '1' in the sequence.
2. STATE_1 (01): Second state, '1' detected, awaiting '0'.
3. STATE_2 (10): Third state, '10' detected, awaiting final '1'.

State Transitions:
- From STATE_0:
  - Transition to STATE_1 on input x == 1.
  - Remain in STATE_0 on input x == 0.
- From STATE_1:
  - Transition to STATE_2 on input x == 0.
  - Remain in STATE_1 on input x == 1.
- From STATE_2:
  - Transition to STATE_0 on input x == 1 and assert z = 1.
  - Transition to STATE_1 on input x == 1 without asserting z.
  - Remain in STATE_2 on input x == 0.

Output Logic:
- The output z is asserted to 1 (logic high) immediately when the sequence "101" is detected, during the transition from STATE_2 to STATE_0 on input x == 1.
- z is otherwise held at 0 (logic low).

Reset Behavior:
- Asynchronous, active-low reset (aresetn).
- On the negative edge of aresetn, the FSM resets to STATE_0 and the output z is set to 0.

Clock and Timing:
- All state transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).

This specification ensures the FSM is capable of detecting overlapping sequences of "101" in the input x, and the asynchronous reset initializes the FSM to a known state. Bit[0] is the least significant bit in state encoding.
