Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Interface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.\n- input wire aresetn: Asynchronous reset signal, active-low, triggered on the negative edge.\n- input wire x: Input data bit for sequence detection.\n- output reg z: Output signal, asserted to 1 when sequence \"101\" is detected.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- Type: Mealy-type FSM\n- Number of States: 3\n- State Encoding: Use 2-bit state encoding.\n\nState Definitions:\n1. STATE_0 (00): Initial state, waiting for the first '1' in the sequence.\n2. STATE_1 (01): Second state, '1' detected, awaiting '0'.\n3. STATE_2 (10): Third state, '10' detected, awaiting final '1'.\n\nState Transitions:\n- From STATE_0:\n  - Transition to STATE_1 on input x == 1.\n  - Remain in STATE_0 on input x == 0.\n- From STATE_1:\n  - Transition to STATE_2 on input x == 0.\n  - Remain in STATE_1 on input x == 1.\n- From STATE_2:\n  - Transition to STATE_0 on input x == 1 and assert z = 1.\n  - Transition to STATE_1 on input x == 1 without asserting z.\n  - Remain in STATE_2 on input x == 0.\n\nOutput Logic:\n- The output z is asserted to 1 (logic high) immediately when the sequence \"101\" is detected, during the transition from STATE_2 to STATE_0 on input x == 1.\n- z is otherwise held at 0 (logic low).\n\nReset Behavior:\n- Asynchronous, active-low reset (aresetn).\n- On the negative edge of aresetn, the FSM resets to STATE_0 and the output z is set to 0.\n\nClock and Timing:\n- All state transitions are triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk).\n\nThis specification ensures the FSM is capable of detecting overlapping sequences of \"101\" in the input x, and the asynchronous reset initializes the FSM to a known state. Bit[0] is the least significant bit in state encoding.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the Mealy-type FSM that recognizes the sequence \"101\", we need to define three states and handle transitions based on the input signal `x`. The FSM should also recognize overlapping sequences and have an asynchronous reset. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We use a 2-bit encoding for the three states:\n   - `S0`: Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.\n   - `S1`: After detecting the first '1', waiting for '0'.\n   - `S2`: After detecting '10', waiting for the final '1'.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: This logic determines the next state based on the current state and input `x`.\n   - From `S0`, transition to `S1` if `x` is 1.\n   - From `S1`, transition to `S2` if `x` is 0.\n   - From `S2`, transition to `S1` and assert `z` if `x` is 1 (sequence \"101\" detected), otherwise transition to `S0`.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: In a Mealy FSM, the output depends on both the state and the input. We assert `z` when transitioning from `S2` to `S1` with `x` being 1.\n\n4. **Asynchronous Reset**: The FSM should reset to `S0` on the negative edge of `aresetn`.\n\n5. **Clock Sensitivity**: All state transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, and `always_comb` for combinational logic. The asynchronous reset is handled in the `always_ff` block.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure the FSM correctly detects the sequence \"101\" and handles overlapping sequences.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic aresetn,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        S0 = 2'b00,  // Initial state\n        S1 = 2'b01,  // State after detecting '1'\n        S2 = 2'b10   // State after detecting '10'\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin\n        if (!aresetn)\n            current_state <= S0;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Next state and output logic\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state; // Default to hold state\n        z = 1'b0; // Default output\n\n        case (current_state)\n            S0: begin\n                if (x)\n                    next_state = S1;\n            end\n            S1: begin\n                if (!x)\n                    next_state = S2;\n            end\n            S2: begin\n                if (x) begin\n                    next_state = S1;\n                    z = 1'b1; // Sequence \"101\" detected\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = S0;\n                end\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The FSM should be able to detect overlapping sequences, meaning that after detecting \"101\", it should be ready to detect another sequence starting from the last '1'. The asynchronous reset should initialize the FSM to the initial state (S0) on the negative edge of `aresetn`.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We use a 2-bit encoding for the three states:\n   - `S0` (00): Initial state, waiting for the first '1'.\n   - `S1` (01): After detecting the first '1', waiting for '0'.\n   - `S2` (10): After detecting '10', waiting for the final '1'.\n\n2. **State Transitions**:\n   - From `S0`: Transition to `S1` if `x` is 1.\n   - From `S1`: Transition to `S2` if `x` is 0.\n   - From `S2`: Transition to `S1` and assert `z` if `x` is 1 (sequence \"101\" detected), otherwise transition to `S0`.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is asserted to 1 when transitioning from `S2` to `S1` with `x` being 1, indicating the sequence \"101\" has been detected.\n\n4. **Reset Logic**: The FSM resets to `S0` on the negative edge of `aresetn`.\n\n5. **Clock Sensitivity**: All state transitions are triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n\nThe implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for signals, using `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic aresetn,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        S0 = 2'b00,  // Initial state\n        S1 = 2'b01,  // State after detecting '1'\n        S2 = 2'b10   // State after detecting '10'\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge aresetn) begin\n        if (!aresetn)\n            current_state <= S0;\n        else\n            current_state <= next_state;\n    end\n\n    // Next state and output logic\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state; // Default to hold state\n        z = 1'b0; // Default output\n\n        case (current_state)\n            S0: begin\n                if (x)\n                    next_state = S1;\n            end\n            S1: begin\n                if (!x)\n                    next_state = S2;\n            end\n            S2: begin\n                if (x) begin\n                    next_state = S1;\n                    z = 1'b1; // Sequence \"101\" detected\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = S0;\n                end\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
