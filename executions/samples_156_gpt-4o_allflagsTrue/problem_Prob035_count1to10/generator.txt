<REASONING>
To implement the decade counter as specified, we need to ensure that the counter counts from 1 to 10 and wraps back to 1 after reaching 10. The counter should be reset to 1 when the reset signal is high, and this reset should occur synchronously with the clock. The output `q` is a 4-bit signal representing the current count value.

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Internal Register**: We use a 4-bit register `count` to hold the current count value. This register is updated on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented inside the `always` block. When `reset` is high, the counter is set to 1. This ensures that the reset is synchronous with the clock.

4. **Counting Logic**: If the reset is not active, the counter increments by 1 on each positive clock edge. If the counter reaches 10, it wraps around to 1.

5. **Output Assignment**: The current value of the counter is assigned to the output `q`.

This implementation follows the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring correct behavior of the decade counter.
