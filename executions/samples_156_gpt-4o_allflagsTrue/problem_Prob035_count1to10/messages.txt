Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal. The module is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `input wire reset`: Active high, synchronous reset signal. Resets the counter on the next positive clock edge when high.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [3:0] q`: 4-bit output representing the current count value, with `q[3]` as the most significant bit (MSB) and `q[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10, inclusively.\n- On each positive edge of the clock, if the reset signal is high, the counter is reset to 4'b0001 (representing the decimal value 1).\n- If the reset signal is low, the counter increments its value by 1 after each clock cycle until it reaches 4'b1010 (representing the decimal value 10).\n- After reaching 10, the counter should wrap around and continue counting from 1 on the next clock cycle.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- The reset is synchronous with the clock; hence, the counter resets on the positive clock edge when `reset` is high.\n- The initial value of the counter on reset is 4'b0001.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- The output `q` should never represent a value outside 1 to 10 due to the wrap-around behavior when the count reaches 10.\n- Ensure that the counter properly wraps from 10 back to 1, maintaining the decade count cycle.\n\nNote:\n- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n- The design assumes the environment provides a stable clock and reset signals as per the given conditions.\n                    "
