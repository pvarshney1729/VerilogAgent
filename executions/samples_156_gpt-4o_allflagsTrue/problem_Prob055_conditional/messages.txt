Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPurpose:\n- The module computes the minimum value of four 8-bit unsigned input values.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input [7:0] a`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n  - `input [7:0] b`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the LSB.\n  - `input [7:0] c`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the LSB.\n  - `input [7:0] d`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the LSB.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output [7:0] min`: 8-bit unsigned output representing the minimum value among the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. The output `min` is updated combinationally.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module performs a combinational logic operation to determine the minimum value among the four 8-bit unsigned inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.\n- Comparison operations use standard unsigned comparison operators (e.g., `a < b`).\n- The output `min` will reflect the minimum value as soon as any of the inputs change, with no clock dependency.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- All inputs are unsigned and can take any value from 0 to 255.\n- In the case of two or more inputs having the same minimum value, `min` will be set to that value.\n- No sequential logic or clocking elements are involved; hence, no reset conditions are applicable.\n- Ensure that race conditions do not occur, as all operations should be evaluated in a single combinational logic cycle.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The logic should handle the full range of 8-bit unsigned values correctly.\n- Ensure that the priority of operations is managed by the comparison logic to avoid incorrect evaluations due to operator precedence.\n                    "
