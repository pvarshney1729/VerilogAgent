Module Name: TopModule

Purpose:
- The module computes the minimum value of four 8-bit unsigned input values.

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [7:0] a`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `input [7:0] b`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the LSB.
  - `input [7:0] c`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the LSB.
  - `input [7:0] d`: 8-bit unsigned input, where bit[0] is the LSB.

- Output Ports:
  - `output [7:0] min`: 8-bit unsigned output representing the minimum value among the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. The output `min` is updated combinationally.

Functional Description:
- The module performs a combinational logic operation to determine the minimum value among the four 8-bit unsigned inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- Comparison operations use standard unsigned comparison operators (e.g., `a < b`).
- The output `min` will reflect the minimum value as soon as any of the inputs change, with no clock dependency.

Edge Cases:
- All inputs are unsigned and can take any value from 0 to 255.
- In the case of two or more inputs having the same minimum value, `min` will be set to that value.
- No sequential logic or clocking elements are involved; hence, no reset conditions are applicable.
- Ensure that race conditions do not occur, as all operations should be evaluated in a single combinational logic cycle.

Implementation Notes:
- The logic should handle the full range of 8-bit unsigned values correctly.
- Ensure that the priority of operations is managed by the comparison logic to avoid incorrect evaluations due to operator precedence.
