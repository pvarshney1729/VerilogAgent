<REASONING>
The task is to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single output port `one` that is always driven to logic high ('1'). Given the simplicity of the task, we do not need any inputs or complex logic. The module will use a continuous assignment statement to drive the output to '1'. Since there are no inputs or clock signals, we do not need to consider synchronous reset or any sequential logic. The guidelines and coding conventions suggest using `logic` for port declarations and using `assign` for combinational logic without an always block, which fits our requirement perfectly.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic one
);

    // Assign a constant logic high to the output
    assign one = 1'b1;

endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
