<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that includes 8 D flip-flops, each triggered by the positive edge of a clock signal. The module has an 8-bit input `d` and an 8-bit output `q`. The output `q` should capture and hold the value of `d` on each rising edge of the clock.

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is declared with the specified input and output ports. The ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Sequential Logic**: An `always` block is used to describe the behavior of the D flip-flops. The block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, which is typical for synchronous sequential logic.

3. **Data Transfer**: Within the `always` block, the output `q` is assigned the value of the input `d` on each rising edge of the clock. This simulates the behavior of 8 parallel D flip-flops, where each bit of `d` is stored in a corresponding flip-flop.

4. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions by using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring that the `always` block is triggered by the clock edge without including a reset signal, as none was specified in the original question.

5. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The implementation is straightforward, focusing on the essential behavior of capturing the input data on the clock edge and outputting it, which meets the requirements of the original specification.
