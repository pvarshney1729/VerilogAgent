Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - clk: 1-bit clock input signal. Triggering occurs on the positive edge.\n  - d: 8-bit data input vector. Bit indexing is from [7:0], where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Outputs:\n  - q: 8-bit data output vector. Bit indexing is from [7:0], where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nDescription:\n- The TopModule contains 8 D-type flip-flops (DFFs).\n- Each DFF is triggered by the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.\n- The 8-bit input 'd' is directly connected to the D inputs of the 8 DFFs.\n- On each positive edge of 'clk', the 8-bit input 'd' is sampled and stored in the corresponding DFFs.\n- The stored values in the DFFs are presented at the output 'q' on the same clock edge.\n\nInitial State:\n- All DFFs are initialized to a known state of 0 at system reset (not specified in original but assumed necessary for clarity).\n\nClocking and Reset:\n- There is no explicit reset signal mentioned; if needed, specify whether a synchronous or asynchronous reset is required and default state upon reset.\n- If a reset is added, assume it initializes all DFFs to a low state (all outputs of 'q' are 0).\n\nOperation:\n- At every rising edge of 'clk', the current value of 'd' is captured and held in the respective DFFs, and the same value is output on 'q'.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure that the clock signal 'clk' adheres to the desired frequency and timing requirements to avoid metastability and ensure reliable operation.\n                    "
