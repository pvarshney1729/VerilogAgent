Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - clk: 1-bit clock input signal. Triggering occurs on the positive edge.
  - d: 8-bit data input vector. Bit indexing is from [7:0], where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Outputs:
  - q: 8-bit data output vector. Bit indexing is from [7:0], where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).

Description:
- The TopModule contains 8 D-type flip-flops (DFFs).
- Each DFF is triggered by the positive edge of the 'clk' signal.
- The 8-bit input 'd' is directly connected to the D inputs of the 8 DFFs.
- On each positive edge of 'clk', the 8-bit input 'd' is sampled and stored in the corresponding DFFs.
- The stored values in the DFFs are presented at the output 'q' on the same clock edge.

Initial State:
- All DFFs are initialized to a known state of 0 at system reset (not specified in original but assumed necessary for clarity).

Clocking and Reset:
- There is no explicit reset signal mentioned; if needed, specify whether a synchronous or asynchronous reset is required and default state upon reset.
- If a reset is added, assume it initializes all DFFs to a low state (all outputs of 'q' are 0).

Operation:
- At every rising edge of 'clk', the current value of 'd' is captured and held in the respective DFFs, and the same value is output on 'q'.

Note:
- Ensure that the clock signal 'clk' adheres to the desired frequency and timing requirements to avoid metastability and ensure reliable operation.
