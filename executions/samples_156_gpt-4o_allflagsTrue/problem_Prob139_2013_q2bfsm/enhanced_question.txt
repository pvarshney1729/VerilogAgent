Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal for sequential logic, triggered on the positive edge.
  - `input resetn`: Synchronous, active-low reset signal. When asserted (0), the FSM remains in the initial state. When de-asserted (1), normal operation begins.
  - `input x`: Sequential input from the motor, used for monitoring specific patterns.
  - `input y`: Sequential input from the motor, used for conditional state transitions.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg f`: Control signal for the motor, set high (1) for one clock cycle after the first clock edge following reset de-assertion.
  - `output reg g`: Control signal for the motor, which behaves based on the x and y input patterns.

FSM Description and Behavior:
- The FSM starts in the initial state, State A, as long as `resetn` is asserted (0).
- Upon de-assertion of `resetn` (1), the FSM transitions out of State A and sets `f = 1` for the next clock cycle, then returns `f` to 0.
- The FSM monitors the `x` input for the pattern {1, 0, 1} over three consecutive clock cycles:
  1. First cycle: `x = 1`
  2. Second cycle: `x = 0`
  3. Third cycle: `x = 1`
- Upon detecting the x-pattern, the FSM sets `g = 1` in the following clock cycle.
- Once `g` is set to 1, the FSM monitors the `y` input:
  - If `y = 1` within the next two clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently until the next reset.
  - If `y` does not equal 1 within the two clock cycles, then `g` is set back to 0 permanently until reset.
- The FSM behavior is described above, ensuring all transitions and output settings occur on the positive edge of `clk`.

Initial State and Reset Behavior:
- The initial state upon power-up or reset assertion is State A.
- All output registers (`f` and `g`) are initially set to 0.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning the FSM responds to the reset signal during the active clock edge, ensuring a predictable reset state.

Indexing and Bit Conventions:
- Inputs and outputs are single-bit signals unless otherwise specified.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit for any multi-bit signals, though currently not applicable as all ports are one-bit.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The FSM assumes stable clock and input signals. Any changes to inputs should be synchronized to the clock edges to avoid metastability.
- The FSM appropriately handles the transition from reset to operational states, ensuring no unintended behavior during power-on or reset cycles.
