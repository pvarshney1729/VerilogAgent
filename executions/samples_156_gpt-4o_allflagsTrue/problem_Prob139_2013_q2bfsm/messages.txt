Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal for sequential logic, triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `input resetn`: Synchronous, active-low reset signal. When asserted (0), the FSM remains in the initial state. When de-asserted (1), normal operation begins.\n  - `input x`: Sequential input from the motor, used for monitoring specific patterns.\n  - `input y`: Sequential input from the motor, used for conditional state transitions.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg f`: Control signal for the motor, set high (1) for one clock cycle after the first clock edge following reset de-assertion.\n  - `output reg g`: Control signal for the motor, which behaves based on the x and y input patterns.\n\nFSM Description and Behavior:\n- The FSM starts in the initial state, State A, as long as `resetn` is asserted (0).\n- Upon de-assertion of `resetn` (1), the FSM transitions out of State A and sets `f = 1` for the next clock cycle, then returns `f` to 0.\n- The FSM monitors the `x` input for the pattern {1, 0, 1} over three consecutive clock cycles:\n  1. First cycle: `x = 1`\n  2. Second cycle: `x = 0`\n  3. Third cycle: `x = 1`\n- Upon detecting the x-pattern, the FSM sets `g = 1` in the following clock cycle.\n- Once `g` is set to 1, the FSM monitors the `y` input:\n  - If `y = 1` within the next two clock cycles, `g` remains 1 permanently until the next reset.\n  - If `y` does not equal 1 within the two clock cycles, then `g` is set back to 0 permanently until reset.\n- The FSM behavior is described above, ensuring all transitions and output settings occur on the positive edge of `clk`.\n\nInitial State and Reset Behavior:\n- The initial state upon power-up or reset assertion is State A.\n- All output registers (`f` and `g`) are initially set to 0.\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning the FSM responds to the reset signal during the active clock edge, ensuring a predictable reset state.\n\nIndexing and Bit Conventions:\n- Inputs and outputs are single-bit signals unless otherwise specified.\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit for any multi-bit signals, though currently not applicable as all ports are one-bit.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- The FSM assumes stable clock and input signals. Any changes to inputs should be synchronized to the clock edges to avoid metastability.\n- The FSM appropriately handles the transition from reset to operational states, ensuring no unintended behavior during power-on or reset cycles.\n                    "

The module is designed to control a finite state machine (FSM) with the specified behavior. The FSM has six states: STATE_A through STATE_F. The FSM starts in STATE_A when the reset signal is asserted. Upon de-assertion of the reset signal, the FSM transitions to STATE_B, where the output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle. The FSM then monitors the input `x` for the sequence 1, 0, 1 over three consecutive clock cycles in STATE_C. Upon detecting this sequence, the FSM transitions to STATE_D, where `g` is set to 1. The FSM then monitors the input `y` for up to two clock cycles. If `y` becomes 1 within this period, the FSM transitions to STATE_E, maintaining `g` at 1 permanently. If `y` does not become 1 within two clock cycles, the FSM transitions to STATE_F, setting `g` to 0 permanently.

The output `f` is set to 1 for one clock cycle after reset is de-asserted, and `g` is set based on the sequence of `x` and the monitoring of `y`. The FSM is designed to handle synchronous reset and operates on the positive edge of the clock. The states are encoded using a typedef enum for clarity, and the logic for state transitions and outputs is implemented using always_ff and always_comb blocks.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic x,\n    input logic y,\n    output logic f,\n    output logic g\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] y_counter;\n    logic [2:0] x_sequence;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            x_sequence <= 3'b000;\n            y_counter <= 2'b00;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == STATE_C) begin\n                x_sequence <= {x_sequence[1:0], x};\n            end\n            if (current_state == STATE_D && g) begin\n                y_counter <= y_counter + 1;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always_comb begin\n        next_state = current_state;\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: if (resetn) next_state = STATE_B;\n            STATE_B: next_state = STATE_C;\n            STATE_C: if (x_sequence == 3'b101) next_state = STATE_D;\n            STATE_D: if (y) next_state = STATE_E;\n                     else if (y_counter == 2'b10) next_state = STATE_F;\n            STATE_E: next_state = STATE_E; // Maintain g = 1 permanently\n            STATE_F: next_state = STATE_F; // Maintain g = 0 permanently\n            default: next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            f <= 0;\n            g <= 0;\n        end else begin\n            case (current_state)\n                STATE_A: f <= 0;\n                STATE_B: f <= 1;\n                STATE_C: f <= 0;\n                STATE_D: g <= 1;\n                STATE_E: g <= 1;\n                STATE_F: g <= 0;\n                default: begin\n                    f <= 0;\n                    g <= 0;\n                end\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
