<REASONING>
The original module had a bug where the outputs `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` were not reset when their conditions were not met. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the conditions change over time. To fix this, I ensured that both `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` are explicitly set to 0 when their respective conditions are not met. This ensures that the outputs are always driven to a known state, preventing any potential latching of previous values.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        else
            shut_off_computer = 0; // Ensure shut_off_computer is reset when not overheated
    end

    always @(*) begin
        if (~arrived)
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
        else
            keep_driving = 0; // Ensure keep_driving is reset when arrived
    end

endmodule
