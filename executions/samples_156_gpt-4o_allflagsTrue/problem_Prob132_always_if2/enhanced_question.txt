Specification for the TopModule:

Module Name: TopModule

Ports:
- Input: 
  - `cpu_overheated`: 1-bit, active-high, indicates whether the CPU is overheated. 
  - `arrived`: 1-bit, active-high, indicates whether the destination has been reached.
  - `gas_tank_empty`: 1-bit, active-high, indicates whether the gas tank is empty.
- Output:
  - `shut_off_computer`: 1-bit, active-high, indicates whether to shut off the computer.
  - `keep_driving`: 1-bit, active-high, indicates whether to keep driving.

Behavior:
1. The modules `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` signals are driven by combinational logic.
2. `shut_off_computer` should be set high if and only if `cpu_overheated` is high.
3. `keep_driving` should be set high if and only if `arrived` is low (not arrived) and `gas_tank_empty` is low (not empty).

Logical Operations:
- The condition for `shut_off_computer` is directly dependent on the `cpu_overheated` input.
- The condition for `keep_driving` is determined by a logical AND between the negation of `arrived` and the negation of `gas_tank_empty`.

Edge Cases:
- If `cpu_overheated` is low, `shut_off_computer` must be low.
- If `arrived` is high, `keep_driving` must be low, regardless of the `gas_tank_empty` state.
- If `arrived` is low and `gas_tank_empty` is high, `keep_driving` must be low.

Ensure that all conditions are mutually exclusive and take precedence as per the logical operation definitions above. No race conditions or undefined states should occur in the implementation.
