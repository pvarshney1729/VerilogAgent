The modules `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` signals are driven by combinational logic.\n2. `shut_off_computer` should be set high if and only if `cpu_overheated` is high.\n3. `keep_driving` should be set high if and only if `arrived` is low (not arrived) and `gas_tank_empty` is low (not empty).\n\nLogical Operations:\n- The condition for `shut_off_computer` is directly dependent on the `cpu_overheated` input.\n- The condition for `keep_driving` is determined by a logical AND between the negation of `arrived` and the negation of `gas_tank_empty`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If `cpu_overheated` is low, `shut_off_computer` must be low.\n- If `arrived` is high, `keep_driving` must be low, regardless of the `gas_tank_empty` state.\n- If `arrived` is low and `gas_tank_empty` is high, `keep_driving` must be low.\n\nEnsure that all conditions are mutually exclusive and take precedence as per the logical operation definitions above.
