Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named TopModule, is required to implement a simple D flip-flop with a synchronous reset. Below is the refined specification for clarity and correctness in implementation:\n\n- **Module Name**: TopModule\n- **Port Definitions**:\n  - `input wire clk`: This is the clock signal input. It triggers all sequential operations on the rising edge.\n  - `input wire d`: This is the data input for the D flip-flop.\n  - `input wire r`: This is the reset input, which is active high and synchronous.\n  - `output reg q`: This is the data output of the D flip-flop.\n\n- **Operational Behavior**:\n  - The module implements a D flip-flop that samples the data input `d` on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.\n  - If the reset input `r` is asserted high during a clock edge, the output `q` will be reset to `0` synchronously with the clock edge.\n  - If the reset input `r` is not asserted (i.e., is low), the output `q` will take the value of the data input `d` on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n  \n- **Bit Indexing and Conventions**:\n  - All signal ports (`clk`, `d`, `r`, and `q`) are single-bit signals.\n  - The most significant bit (MSB) and the least significant bit (LSB) for each signal are the same, given that they are all 1-bit wide.\n\n- **Reset Specification**:\n  - The reset is synchronous, meaning it only affects the output `q` on the rising edge of the clock.\n  - The reset state of the output `q` is defined to be `0`.\n  \n- **Initial Conditions**:\n  - Explicit initialization of the output `q` is not required, as it is determined by the first active clock edge after reset.\n\n- **Edge Cases and Boundaries**:\n  - The behavior is explicitly defined for the synchronous reset and normal data sampling. Any undefined states or transitions should default to the last known state of `q` unless reset is asserted.\n\nThis specification ensures that the intended functionality of a synchronous D flip-flop with a reset is clearly outlined, supporting accurate implementation.\n                    "
