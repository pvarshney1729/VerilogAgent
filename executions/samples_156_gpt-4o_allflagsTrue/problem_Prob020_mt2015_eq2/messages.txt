Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - A: 2-bit vector, input. Naming convention: `A[1:0]`, where `A[1]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `A[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n  - B: 2-bit vector, input. Naming convention: `B[1:0]`, where `B[1]` is the MSB and `B[0]` is the LSB.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - z: 1-bit scalar, output. \n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module compares the two 2-bit input vectors, `A` and `B`.\n- The output `z` should be set to 1 if the two input vectors are equal, i.e., if `A[1:0]` equals `B[1:0]`.\n- If `A` does not equal `B`, the output `z` should be set to 0.\n\nOperational Details:\n- This is a combinational logic circuit; the output `z` is determined purely by the current values of inputs `A` and `B` without any clock dependency.\n- Ensure that the comparison checks all bits of the input vectors simultaneously to avoid any race conditions.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- All possible values of `A` (00, 01, 10, 11) and `B` (00, 01, 10, 11) shall be considered, resulting in a total of 16 combinations.\n- The output `z` should accurately reflect equality only when `A` matches `B` exactly across all bits.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
