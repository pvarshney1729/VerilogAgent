<REASONING>
The task requires implementing a Verilog module named `TopModule` that compares two 2-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and outputs a 1-bit signal `z`. The output `z` should be 1 if the inputs `A` and `B` are equal, otherwise, it should be 0. This is a simple combinational logic task, so we will use an `assign` statement to directly compare the inputs and produce the output. Since the task does not involve any sequential logic or clocked elements, there is no need for a synchronous reset or any flip-flops. We will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for port declarations and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [1:0] A,
    input logic [1:0] B,
    output logic z
);

    // Combinational logic to compare A and B
    assign z = (A == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

endmodule
