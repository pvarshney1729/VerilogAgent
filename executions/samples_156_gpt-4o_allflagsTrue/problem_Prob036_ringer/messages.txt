        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- Input: \n  - `ring`: 1-bit unsigned input. This signal indicates an incoming call.\n  - `vibrate_mode`: 1-bit unsigned input. This signal indicates whether the phone is in vibrate mode.\n\n- Output:\n  - `ringer`: 1-bit unsigned output. This signal controls the phone's ringer.\n  - `motor`: 1-bit unsigned output. This signal controls the phone's vibration motor.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module controls the behavior of a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor based on incoming call status and vibrate mode settings.\n- When an incoming call is detected (`ring = 1`), the module must activate either the `ringer` or the `motor`, but not both, ensuring mutual exclusivity.\n\nOperational Logic:\n1. If `vibrate_mode` is asserted (`vibrate_mode = 1`), the `motor` output should be activated (`motor = 1`) and the `ringer` output should remain deactivated (`ringer = 0`).\n2. If `vibrate_mode` is not asserted (`vibrate_mode = 0`), the `ringer` output should be activated (`ringer = 1`) and the `motor` output should remain deactivated (`motor = 0`).\n\n- Default State: When `ring = 0`, both `ringer` and `motor` outputs should be deactivated (`ringer = 0`, `motor = 0`).\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that at no time both `ringer` and `motor` are active simultaneously under any input conditions.\n- The implementation should not contain sequential logic or state-holding elements, as the described functionality is purely combinational based on the given inputs.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All bits are indexed from 0, where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit.\n\nReset/Initialization: \n- Since the module is purely combinational, no reset mechanism is required, and no initial values need to be defined for outputs as they depend directly on inputs at all times.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
