Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: 
  - `ring`: 1-bit unsigned input. This signal indicates an incoming call.
  - `vibrate_mode`: 1-bit unsigned input. This signal indicates whether the phone is in vibrate mode.

- Output:
  - `ringer`: 1-bit unsigned output. This signal controls the phone's ringer.
  - `motor`: 1-bit unsigned output. This signal controls the phone's vibration motor.

Functional Description:
- The module controls the behavior of a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor based on incoming call status and vibrate mode settings.
- When an incoming call is detected (`ring = 1`), the module must activate either the `ringer` or the `motor`, but not both, ensuring mutual exclusivity.

Operational Logic:
1. If `vibrate_mode` is asserted (`vibrate_mode = 1`), the `motor` output should be activated (`motor = 1`) and the `ringer` output should remain deactivated (`ringer = 0`).
2. If `vibrate_mode` is not asserted (`vibrate_mode = 0`), the `ringer` output should be activated (`ringer = 1`) and the `motor` output should remain deactivated (`motor = 0`).

- Default State: When `ring = 0`, both `ringer` and `motor` outputs should be deactivated (`ringer = 0`, `motor = 0`).

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that at no time both `ringer` and `motor` are active simultaneously under any input conditions.
- The implementation should not contain sequential logic or state-holding elements, as the described functionality is purely combinational based on the given inputs.

Bit Indexing:
- All bits are indexed from 0, where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit.

Reset/Initialization: 
- Since the module is purely combinational, no reset mechanism is required, and no initial values need to be defined for outputs as they depend directly on inputs at all times.
