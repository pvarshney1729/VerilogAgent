<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Definition:
- Inputs:
  - `input [255:0] in`: A 256-bit wide input vector where `in[0]` is the least significant bit and `in[255]` is the most significant bit.
  - `input [7:0] sel`: An 8-bit wide selection input where `sel` is interpreted as an unsigned integer.

- Output:
  - `output out`: A 1-bit wide output determined by the selection input.

Functional Description:
- The module functions as a 256-to-1 multiplexer with the following behavior:
  - The `sel` input selects one of the 256 bits from the `in` vector to drive the `out` output.
  - Specifically, when `sel = n` (where `n` is an integer from 0 to 255), the output `out` will be assigned the value of `in[n]`.

Additional Notes:
- The design is purely combinational and does not involve any sequential elements or clock signals.
- There are no reset signals involved as this module does not contain any state.
- Ensure that `sel` is within the valid range (0 to 255) to prevent unintended behavior. The behavior for `sel` values outside this range is not defined within this specification.
- The operation should be free of race conditions as the selection logic solely depends on stable combinational paths.
