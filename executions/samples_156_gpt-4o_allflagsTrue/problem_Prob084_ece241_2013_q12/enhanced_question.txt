Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
- `input enable`: Synchronous active-high enable signal for shifting.
- `input S`: Serial input for the shift register, bit[0] is the least significant bit.
- `input A`: Address bit 0 for read operation, bit[0] is the least significant bit.
- `input B`: Address bit 1 for read operation, bit[0] is the least significant bit.
- `input C`: Address bit 2 for read operation, bit[0] is the least significant bit.
- `output Z`: Output of the module based on address selection, driven combinationally by the multiplexer.

Internal Logic:
1. **8-bit Shift Register**:
   - Construct using eight D-type flip-flops with outputs labeled `Q[0]` to `Q[7]`.
   - The shift register shifts serially from `Q[0]` to `Q[7]` with `S` feeding `Q[0]`.
   - Shifting occurs on the positive edge of `clk` only when `enable` is high.
   - All flip-flops have an initial value of 0 on reset.

2. **Multiplexer for Output Z**:
   - A 3-to-8 decoder selects one output line based on the 3-bit input `ABC`.
   - The output `Z` is determined by the state of `Q[n]` where `n` is the binary value of `ABC`.
   - Example mappings: `ABC = 000` maps to `Z = Q[0]`, `ABC = 001` maps to `Z = Q[1]`, ..., `ABC = 111` maps to `Z = Q[7]`.

3. **Clock and Reset**:
   - The shift register operates on the positive edge of the `clk`.
   - Reset functionality is not explicitly defined in the original specification; assume all registers start in a known state, typically 0, unless otherwise specified.

Behavior:
- The module shifts in new data on the serial input `S` when `enable` is high and outputs `Z` based on the combination of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
- The selection of `Z` based on `ABC` is combinational and driven by the decoder logic.

Edge Cases:
- If `enable` is low, the shift register maintains its current state.
- Ensure no undefined behavior occurs for any combination of `ABC`.
