Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input [7:0] in`: An 8-bit input vector where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output parity`: A 1-bit output representing the even parity bit for the input data.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module calculates an even parity bit for the 8-bit input vector `in`. The parity bit ensures that the total number of '1' bits in the 9 bits (8 data bits + 1 parity bit) is even.\n\n- The even parity bit is computed as the XOR of all 8 bits of the input vector:\n  - `parity = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3] ^ in[4] ^ in[5] ^ in[6] ^ in[7]`\n\nOperational Details:\n- The logic for computing the parity bit is combinational. There are no clocked elements or sequential logic involved.\n- As this is purely combinational logic, there are no reset conditions or initial values to define for this module.\n- The output `parity` is updated immediately with any change in the input vector `in`, ensuring that the parity bit always reflects the current state of the input.\n\nEdge Case Considerations:\n- The parity calculation is valid for all possible 8-bit input combinations (from 0x00 to 0xFF).\n- The module should correctly handle all input transitions, with the parity bit updated asynchronously relative to the input changes.\n\nThis specification ensures that the implementation will correctly compute and output an even parity bit for any 8-bit input vector provided.\n                    "
