Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit input signal, serves as the clock for all sequential elements.\n  - `reset`: 1-bit input signal, active-high synchronous reset.\n- Outputs:\n  - `q`: 5-bit output vector, representing the state of the LFSR.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).\n- The LFSR operates on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- A synchronous reset (`reset`) initializes the LFSR state to `5'b00001` when asserted.\n\nLFSR Operation:\n- The LFSR shifts its content to the right on each positive clock edge.\n- For bit positions with taps (5 and 3), the new bit value is determined by XOR-ing the current value of the bit with the least significant bit (`q[0]`).\n- Bit positions without taps simply shift the value of the next higher bit position.\n\nTap Positions:\n- Bit positions are indexed from 1 to 5, where bit[1] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Taps are present at bit positions 5 (MSB) and 3.\n- The LFSR transitions through a cycle of 2^5 - 1 = 31 states, not including the all-zero state, which is never reached.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- On the assertion of `reset`, the LFSR state (`q`) is set to `5'b00001`.\n- The reset is synchronous, meaning it will only take effect on the next positive edge of `clk` after `reset` is asserted.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The all-zero state is never reached and should not be used as an initial state.\n- Ensure that `reset` is deasserted before normal operation to avoid unintended initialization to zero.\n\nNote:\n- The LFSR must be designed to ensure that it cycles through all possible non-zero states.\n- Ensure that there are no race conditions by adhering to the synchronous nature of the `reset` and clock signals.\n                    "

For a Galois LFSR, the feedback is generated by XOR-ing the least significant bit (`lfsr_reg[0]`) with the bit at the tapped position (`lfsr_reg[2]`).\n\n4. **Synchronous Reset**: Implement a synchronous reset that initializes the LFSR to a non-zero state (`5'b00001`) when `reset` is asserted. This ensures the LFSR starts cycling through its states correctly.\n\n5. **Shift Logic**: On each clock cycle, shift the register to the right and insert the feedback bit at the most significant position. This is done using the concatenation operator `{}`.\n\n6. **Output Assignment**: Assign the internal register `lfsr_reg` to the output `q` to reflect the current state of the LFSR.\n\nBy following these steps, the module adheres to the specified interface and functionality, ensuring correct operation of the LFSR.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    output logic [4:0] q\n);\n\n    logic [4:0] lfsr_reg;\n    logic feedback;\n\n    // XOR feedback logic for Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3\n    assign feedback = lfsr_reg[0] ^ lfsr_reg[2];\n\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            lfsr_reg <= 5'b00001; // Reset state\n        end else begin\n            lfsr_reg <= {feedback, lfsr_reg[4:1]}; // Shift right with feedback\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Assign the internal register to the output\n    assign q = lfsr_reg;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
