Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: clk (1-bit) - Clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic.
- Input: x (1-bit) - Data input to the logic gates.
- Output: z (1-bit) - Resultant output from the three-input NOR gate.

Finite State Machine Description:
- The module implements a combinational and sequential logic system using a set of logic gates and D flip-flops.
- Inputs:
  - x is fed into three different two-input gates: XOR, AND, and OR.
  
D Flip-Flops Configuration:
- There are three D flip-flops, each associated with one of the gates (XOR, AND, OR).
- Each flip-flop captures the output of its respective gate on the positive edge of the clock, `clk`.
- All D flip-flops are initialized to 0 via a synchronous reset mechanism at the start of operation.

Gate Connections:
1. XOR Gate:
   - Inputs: x, and the output of its corresponding D flip-flop.
   - The XOR gate combines the input x with the current state (output) of its corresponding flip-flop.
   
2. AND Gate:
   - Inputs: x, and the complemented output of its corresponding D flip-flop.
   - The AND gate combines the input x with the complement of the current state of its corresponding flip-flop.

3. OR Gate:
   - Inputs: x, and the complemented output of its corresponding D flip-flop.
   - The OR gate combines the input x with the complement of the current state of its corresponding flip-flop.

Output Logic:
- The outputs from the three D flip-flops are fed into a three-input NOR gate.
- The output z of the NOR gate represents the logical NOR of the three flip-flop outputs.

Reset Behavior:
- All D flip-flops are initially reset to 0 before the state machine begins operation.
- The reset is synchronous, occurring on the positive edge of the clock.

Indexing Convention:
- The module follows a bit indexing convention where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Clock and Timing:
- The module's sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal, `clk`.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The system is designed to handle all possible input combinations of x, ensuring correct operation across all states.
