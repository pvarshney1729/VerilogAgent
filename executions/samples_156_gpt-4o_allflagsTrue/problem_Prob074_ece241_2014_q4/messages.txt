The result is stored back into the D flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n3. **OR Gate**: The OR gate takes `x` and the complemented output of its corresponding D flip-flop (`~q_or`) as inputs. The result is stored back into the D flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock.\n\n4. **NOR Gate**: The outputs of the three D flip-flops (`q_xor`, `q_and`, `q_or`) are combined using a three-input NOR gate to produce the output `z`.\n\nThe implementation ensures that all flip-flops are initialized to zero and are triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The logic is implemented using an `always` block for sequential logic and an `assign` statement for the combinational NOR gate.\n\nThe code adheres to the provided coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, not specifying the sensitivity list explicitly for combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    logic q_xor, q_and, q_or;\n\n    // Sequential logic for D flip-flops\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        q_xor <= x ^ q_xor;     // XOR gate with D flip-flop\n        q_and <= x & ~q_and;    // AND gate with D flip-flop\n        q_or  <= x | ~q_or;     // OR gate with D flip-flop\n    end\n\n    // Combinational logic for NOR gate\n    assign z = ~(q_xor | q_and | q_or);\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
