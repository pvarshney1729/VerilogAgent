<REASONING>
To implement the specified finite state machine, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with inputs `clk` and `x`, and output `z`. The module uses three D flip-flops, each associated with a logic gate (XOR, AND, OR). The outputs of these flip-flops are then fed into a three-input NOR gate to produce the output `z`.

1. **XOR Gate**: The XOR gate takes `x` and the output of its corresponding D flip-flop (`q_xor`) as inputs. The result is stored back into the D flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock.

2. **AND Gate**: The AND gate takes `x` and the complemented output of its corresponding D flip-flop (`~q_and`) as inputs. The result is stored back into the D flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **OR Gate**: The OR gate takes `x` and the complemented output of its corresponding D flip-flop (`~q_or`) as inputs. The result is stored back into the D flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock.

4. **NOR Gate**: The outputs of the three D flip-flops (`q_xor`, `q_and`, `q_or`) are combined using a three-input NOR gate to produce the output `z`.

The implementation ensures that all flip-flops are initialized to zero and are triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The logic is implemented using an `always` block for sequential logic and an `assign` statement for the combinational NOR gate.

The code adheres to the provided coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, not specifying the sensitivity list explicitly for combinational logic, and ensuring that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

    logic q_xor, q_and, q_or;

    // Sequential logic for D flip-flops
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q_xor <= x ^ q_xor;     // XOR gate with D flip-flop
        q_and <= x & ~q_and;    // AND gate with D flip-flop
        q_or  <= x | ~q_or;     // OR gate with D flip-flop
    end

    // Combinational logic for NOR gate
    assign z = ~(q_xor | q_and | q_or);
