<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specification and guidelines:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The `areset` signal is included in the sensitivity list of the `always` block to ensure it acts as an asynchronous reset. When `areset` is asserted, the counter is reset to `2'b01`, representing a weakly not-taken state.

3. **Counter Logic**: The counter logic is implemented within the `always` block. The counter only updates when `train_valid` is high:
   - If `train_taken` is high, the counter increments, ensuring it does not exceed `2'b11`.
   - If `train_taken` is low, the counter decrements, ensuring it does not go below `2'b00`.

4. **State Retention**: When `train_valid` is low, the counter retains its current value, as there are no conditions to change the state.

5. **Sensitivity List**: The `always` block is sensitive to both `clk` and `areset`, ensuring the asynchronous reset functionality.

6. **Output Assignment**: The `state` output directly reflects the current counter value, which is updated based on the conditions described.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves as a two-bit saturating counter with the specified reset and update conditions.
