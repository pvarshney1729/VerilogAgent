<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to create a Verilog module with two inputs (`a` and `b`) and two outputs (`out_assign` and `out_alwaysblock`). The module will perform a logical AND operation on the inputs using two different methods: an `assign` statement and a combinational `always` block.

1. **Interface Definition**: Define the module with the specified input and output ports. Since the coding conventions suggest using `logic` instead of `wire` or `reg`, we will declare all ports as `logic`.

2. **Assign Statement**: Use an `assign` statement to perform the AND operation on inputs `a` and `b`, and assign the result to `out_assign`.

3. **Combinational Always Block**: Implement a combinational `always` block using `always @(*)` to perform the AND operation and assign the result to `out_alwaysblock`.

4. **Coding Conventions**: Ensure that all numeric constants have a size greater than zero, and follow the guidelines for using `always @(*)` for combinational logic.

5. **Synchronous Reset**: Although the guidelines mention synchronous reset, the original specification does not require it, so it will not be included in this implementation.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module adheres to the given specifications and coding conventions.

    assign out_assign = a & b;

    // AND gate using combinational always block
    always @(*) begin
        out_alwaysblock = a & b;
