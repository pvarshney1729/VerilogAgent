Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a;` // Single-bit input, representing operand 'a'.
  - `input wire b;` // Single-bit input, representing operand 'b'.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out_assign;` // Single-bit output for AND operation using assign statement.
  - `output wire out_alwaysblock;` // Single-bit output for AND operation using combinational always block.

Functional Description:
- The module `TopModule` will perform a logical AND operation on the inputs `a` and `b`.
- The AND operation will be implemented in two ways:
  1. Using an `assign` statement to drive the output `out_assign`.
  2. Using a combinational `always` block to drive the output `out_alwaysblock`.

Signal and Block Descriptions:
- The `assign` statement should directly assign the result of the logical AND operation (`a & b`) to `out_assign`.
- The `always` block should be a combinational logic block, sensitive to any changes in inputs `a` or `b`. It should compute the AND operation and assign the result to `out_alwaysblock`.

Timing and Sensitivity:
- Ensure that the `always` block is specified as a combinational block (`always @*` or `always @(a, b)`) to reflect changes immediately when inputs change.
- There are no sequential elements; hence, there are no clock or reset conditions to specify.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- As both inputs and outputs are single-bit, the only logical conditions to consider are the truth table for the AND operation:
  - `a = 0, b = 0` results in `out_assign = 0`, `out_alwaysblock = 0`
  - `a = 0, b = 1` results in `out_assign = 0`, `out_alwaysblock = 0`
  - `a = 1, b = 0` results in `out_assign = 0`, `out_alwaysblock = 0`
  - `a = 1, b = 1` results in `out_assign = 1`, `out_alwaysblock = 1`

No additional initialization or special conditions apply, as all operations are purely combinational.
