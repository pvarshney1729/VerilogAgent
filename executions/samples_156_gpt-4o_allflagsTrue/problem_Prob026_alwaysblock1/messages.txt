Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire a;` // Single-bit input, representing operand 'a'.\n  - `input wire b;` // Single-bit input, representing operand 'b'.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out_assign;` // Single-bit output for AND operation using assign statement.\n  - `output wire out_alwaysblock;` // Single-bit output for AND operation using combinational always block.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module `TopModule` will perform a logical AND operation on the inputs `a` and `b`.\n- The AND operation will be implemented in two ways:\n  1. Using an `assign` statement to drive the output `out_assign`.\n  2. Using a combinational `always` block to drive the output `out_alwaysblock`.\n\nSignal and Block Descriptions:\n- The `assign` statement should directly assign the result of the logical AND operation (`a & b`) to `out_assign`.\n- The `always` block should be a combinational logic block, sensitive to any changes in inputs `a` or `b`. It should compute the AND operation and assign the result to `out_alwaysblock`.\n\nTiming and Sensitivity:\n- Ensure that the `always` block is specified as a combinational block (`always @*` or `always @(a, b)`) to reflect changes immediately when inputs change.\n- There are no sequential elements; hence, there are no clock or reset conditions to specify.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- As both inputs and outputs are single-bit, the only logical conditions to consider are the truth table for the AND operation:\n  - `a = 0, b = 0` results in `out_assign = 0`, `out_alwaysblock = 0`\n  - `a = 0, b = 1` results in `out_assign = 0`, `out_alwaysblock = 0`\n  - `a = 1, b = 0` results in `out_assign = 0`, `out_alwaysblock = 0`\n  - `a = 1, b = 1` results in `out_assign = 1`, `out_alwaysblock = 1`\n\nNo additional initialization or special conditions apply, as all operations are purely combinational.\n                    "
