Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a` : 1-bit, unsigned
  - `input wire b` : 1-bit, unsigned
  - `input wire c` : 1-bit, unsigned
  - `input wire d` : 1-bit, unsigned
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire q` : 1-bit, unsigned

Circuit Type:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).

Functional Description:
- The output `q` is determined based on the logical combination of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- The truth table below provides the mapping of input combinations to the output `q`:

  | a | b | c | d | q |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the combinational logic is implemented to match the truth table provided.
- No clock or reset signals are involved as it is purely combinational logic.
- Ensure no race conditions as the circuit is purely combinational.

Edge Cases:
- All 16 possible combinations of inputs are covered within the truth table.
