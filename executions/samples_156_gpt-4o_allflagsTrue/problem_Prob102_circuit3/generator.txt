<REASONING>
The task is to implement a combinational logic circuit based on the provided truth table. The truth table indicates the output `q` for all combinations of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. By analyzing the truth table, we can derive the logic expression for `q`.

From the truth table:
- `q` is `1` when:
  - `b` is `1` and `d` is `1`
  - `b` is `1` and `c` is `1`
  - `a` is `1` and `d` is `1`
  - `a` is `1` and `c` is `1`

The logic expression for `q` can be derived as:
- `q = (b & d) | (b & c) | (a & d) | (a & c)`

This expression covers all the cases where `q` is `1` according to the truth table. The implementation will use this logic expression to drive the output `q`.
