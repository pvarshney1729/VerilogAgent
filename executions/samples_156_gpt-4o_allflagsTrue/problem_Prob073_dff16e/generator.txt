<REASONING>
To implement the TopModule, we need to follow the given specifications and guidelines. The module requires a synchronous, active-low reset and byte-enable functionality for writing to specific bytes of a 16-bit register. The design involves using D flip-flops to store the 16-bit data, with the ability to selectively update the upper or lower byte based on the byteena signals.

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module with the specified inputs and outputs. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Sequential Logic**: We use an `always @(posedge clk)` block to implement the synchronous behavior. The block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: Inside the always block, we first check the reset condition. If `resetn` is low, we reset the output `q` to zero. This is a synchronous reset, meaning it occurs on the clock edge.

4. **Byte-Enable Logic**: If `resetn` is high, we proceed to check the byteena signals. We use conditional statements to determine which bytes of `q` should be updated:
   - If `byteena[1]` is high, we update the upper byte `q[15:8]` with `d[15:8]`.
   - If `byteena[0]` is high, we update the lower byte `q[7:0]` with `d[7:0]`.

5. **Output Assignment**: The output `q` is directly driven by the logic within the always block, ensuring it reflects the current state of the flip-flops.

This implementation adheres to the guidelines by ensuring a synchronous reset, using logic for all signals, and correctly handling the byte-enable functionality.
