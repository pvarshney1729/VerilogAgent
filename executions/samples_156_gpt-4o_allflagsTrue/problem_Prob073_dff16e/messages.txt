Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal, triggering on the positive edge.\n  - `input resetn`: Synchronous active-low reset signal. When `resetn` is low, all flip-flops reset to their initial state.\n  - `input [1:0] byteena`: Byte-enable signal, 2 bits.\n    - `byteena[1]` controls the writing of the upper byte `d[15:8]`.\n    - `byteena[0]` controls the writing of the lower byte `d[7:0]`.\n  - `input [15:0] d`: Data input, 16 bits wide.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output [15:0] q`: Output data, 16 bits wide. This represents the current state of the flip-flops.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module consists of 16 D flip-flops, each corresponding to a bit in the output `q`.\n- The flip-flops are sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal.\n- The `resetn` signal is a synchronous active-low reset. When `resetn` is asserted (0), all flip-flops will reset to 0 on the next rising edge of `clk`.\n- During normal operation (when `resetn` is high), the flip-flops' behavior is determined by the `byteena` signals:\n  - If `byteena[1]` is high, the upper byte `q[15:8]` is updated with `d[15:8]`.\n  - If `byteena[0]` is high, the lower byte `q[7:0]` is updated with `d[7:0]`.\n  - If a `byteena` bit is low, the corresponding byte in `q` retains its previous value.\n\nAdditional Details:\n- Bit Indexing: `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- Edge Cases: Ensure proper operation when the `resetn` is toggled or when `byteena` changes at the clock edge.\n- Initialization: At power-up, ensure all flip-flops start with a known state, typically reset to 0 on the first reset event.\n                    "

If `resetn` is low, we reset the output `q` to zero. This is a synchronous reset, meaning it occurs on the clock edge.\n\n4. **Byte-Enable Logic**: If `resetn` is high, we proceed to check the byteena signals. We use conditional statements to determine which bytes of `q` should be updated:\n   - If `byteena[1]` is high, we update the upper byte `q[15:8]` with `d[15:8]`.\n   - If `byteena[0]` is high, we update the lower byte `q[7:0]` with `d[7:0]`.\n\n5. **Output Assignment**: The output `q` is directly driven by the logic within the always block, ensuring it reflects the current state of the flip-flops.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the guidelines by ensuring a synchronous reset, using logic for all signals, and correctly handling the byte-enable functionality.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic resetn,\n    input logic [1:0] byteena,\n    input logic [15:0] d,\n    output logic [15:0] q\n);\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (!resetn) begin\n            q <= 16'b0;\n        end else begin\n            if (byteena[1]) begin\n                q[15:8] <= d[15:8];\n            end\n            if (byteena[0]) begin\n                q[7:0] <= d[7:0];\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
