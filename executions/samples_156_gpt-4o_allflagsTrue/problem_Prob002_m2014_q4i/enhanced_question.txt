<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports: None
- Output Ports:
  - output logic out

Functional Description:
- The module 'TopModule' shall have a single output port named 'out'.
- The output port 'out' is a 1-bit wide logic signal.
- The module will continuously drive the output 'out' to a logic low (0).

Implementation Details:
- The output 'out' is combinational in nature, driven directly without any clock or sequential logic.
- No reset or clock signals are required as there is no stateful behavior.
- The output 'out' will always maintain a constant value of 0 regardless of any external conditions or inputs, as there are no inputs defined for this module.

Note:
- Ensure that the output 'out' remains stable and consistently at logic low throughout the operation of the module.
