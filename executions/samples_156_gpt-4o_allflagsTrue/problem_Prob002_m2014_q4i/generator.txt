<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single output port `out` that always drives a logic low (0). There are no input ports or additional logic required. The guidelines and coding conventions provided suggest using an `assign` statement for combinational logic, which is appropriate here since the output is constant and does not depend on any inputs or clock signals. The output should be declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions, even though in this simple case, it doesn't affect functionality. The module will use an `assign` statement to continuously drive the output `out` to 0.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic out
);

    // Assign a constant logic low (0) to the output 'out'
    assign out = 1'b0;

endmodule
[DONE]
