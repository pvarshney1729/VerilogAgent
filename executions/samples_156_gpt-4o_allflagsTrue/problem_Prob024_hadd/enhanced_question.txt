Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule is designed to implement a half adder which takes two single-bit inputs and produces a single-bit sum and a single-bit carry-out.

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a`: 1-bit input signal representing the first operand.
  - `input wire b`: 1-bit input signal representing the second operand.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire sum`: 1-bit output signal representing the sum of inputs `a` and `b`.
  - `output wire cout`: 1-bit output signal representing the carry-out resulting from the addition of `a` and `b`.

Functional Specification:
- The half adder's function is defined by the following operations:
  - `sum = a XOR b`: The `sum` output is the result of the bitwise XOR operation on inputs `a` and `b`.
  - `cout = a AND b`: The `cout` output is the result of the bitwise AND operation on inputs `a` and `b`.

- Bit Indexing:
  - Each input and output is a single bit, thus the bit indexing is not applicable beyond specifying they are single-bit signals.

- Logic Type:
  - The logic within this module is purely combinational and does not involve any clocked or sequential elements.

- Edge Cases:
  - The module correctly handles all possible combinations of single-bit inputs `a` and `b` (i.e., 00, 01, 10, 11) without any race conditions or dependencies, as each operation is independent and instantaneous.

Note: As this is a purely combinational circuit, there are no resets, clock signals, or initial values applicable to this specification.
