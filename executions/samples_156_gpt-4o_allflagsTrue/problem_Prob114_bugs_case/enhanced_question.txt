Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - code: 8-bit input vector [7:0] where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.
- Outputs:
  - out: 4-bit output vector [3:0] representing the detected key, where bit[0] is the least significant bit.
  - valid: 1-bit output indicating the detection status.

Functional Description:
- The module processes an 8-bit input `code` representing keyboard scancodes for numeric keys 0 through 9.
- The module checks whether the `code` matches any of the predefined scancodes:
  - 8'h45 (scancode for '0')
  - 8'h16 (scancode for '1')
  - 8'h1e (scancode for '2')
  - 8'h26 (scancode for '3')
  - 8'h25 (scancode for '4')
  - 8'h2e (scancode for '5')
  - 8'h36 (scancode for '6')
  - 8'h3d (scancode for '7')
  - 8'h3e (scancode for '8')
  - 8'h46 (scancode for '9')

Output Behavior:
- If the `code` matches one of the specified scancodes, the `valid` output is set to 1, and the `out` output is set to the corresponding 4-bit binary representation of the detected key (from 0 to 9).
- If the `code` does not match any of the specified scancodes, the `valid` output is set to 0, and the `out` output is set to 4'b0000.

Additional Considerations:
- This module is purely combinational logic, with no clock or reset signals required.
- There are no dependencies on previous inputs, and the outputs are determined solely by the current input `code`.
- Ensure that all outputs default to the specified values in case of non-matching input.
