Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - code: 8-bit input vector [7:0] where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n- Outputs:\n  - out: 4-bit output vector [3:0] representing the detected key, where bit[0] is the least significant bit.\n  - valid: 1-bit output indicating the detection status.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module processes an 8-bit input `code` representing keyboard scancodes for numeric keys 0 through 9.\n- The module checks whether the `code` matches any of the predefined scancodes:\n  - 8'h45 (scancode for '0')\n  - 8'h16 (scancode for '1')\n  - 8'h1e (scancode for '2')\n  - 8'h26 (scancode for '3')\n  - 8'h25 (scancode for '4')\n  - 8'h2e (scancode for '5')\n  - 8'h36 (scancode for '6')\n  - 8'h3d (scancode for '7')\n  - 8'h3e (scancode for '8')\n  - 8'h46 (scancode for '9')\n\nOutput Behavior:\n- If the `code` matches one of the specified scancodes, the `valid` output is set to 1, and the `out` output is set to the corresponding 4-bit binary representation of the detected key (from 0 to 9).\n- If the `code` does not match any of the specified scancodes, the `valid` output is set to 0, and the `out` output is set to 4'b0000.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- This module is purely combinational logic, with no clock or reset signals required.\n- There are no dependencies on previous inputs, and the outputs are determined solely by the current input `code`.\n- Ensure that all outputs default to the specified values in case of non-matching input.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` is designed to recognize specific 8-bit keyboard scancodes corresponding to the numeric keys 0 through 9. The module uses a combinational `always` block to evaluate the input `code` and determine the appropriate outputs `out` and `valid`. The `case` statement is used to match the input `code` against the predefined scancodes. If a match is found, the `out` is set to the corresponding 4-bit binary representation of the detected key, and `valid` is set to 1. If no match is found, both `out` and `valid` are set to 0.
