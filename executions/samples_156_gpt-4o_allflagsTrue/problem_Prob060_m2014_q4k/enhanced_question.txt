Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: A single-bit clock input signal. The module operates on the rising edge of this clock.
  - resetn: A single-bit active-low synchronous reset input. A '0' value on this signal will reset the shift register.
  - in: A single-bit data input for the shift register.
- Output Ports:
  - out: A single-bit output representing the most significant bit (MSB) of the shift register.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 4-bit shift register using D flip-flops.
- The shift register shifts data on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The resetn signal is a synchronous active-low reset. When resetn is '0' during a clock edge, all bits in the shift register are reset to '0'.
- The initial state of all flip-flops in the shift register is '0'.
- Data shifts from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) with each positive clock edge.
- The input 'in' is loaded into the LSB of the shift register on each clock cycle.
- The output 'out' directly reflects the current MSB of the shift register.

Signal Conventions:
- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) of the shift register.
- Bit[3] refers to the most significant bit (MSB) of the shift register.

Edge Cases:
- During synchronous reset (resetn = '0'), all bits in the shift register are cleared to '0' on the next rising clock edge.
- If resetn is held low across multiple clock cycles, the shift register remains in the reset state with all bits '0'.
