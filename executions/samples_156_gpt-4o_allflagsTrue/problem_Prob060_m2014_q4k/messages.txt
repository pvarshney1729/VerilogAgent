The module operates on the rising edge of this clock.\n  - resetn: A single-bit active-low synchronous reset input. A '0' value on this signal will reset the shift register.\n  - in: A single-bit data input for the shift register.\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: A single-bit output representing the most significant bit (MSB) of the shift register.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 4-bit shift register using D flip-flops.\n- The shift register shifts data on the rising edge of the clk signal.\n- The resetn signal is a synchronous active-low reset. When resetn is '0' during a clock edge, all bits in the shift register are reset to '0'.\n- The initial state of all flip-flops in the shift register is '0'.\n- Data shifts from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) with each positive clock edge.\n- The input 'in' is loaded into the LSB of the shift register on each clock cycle.\n- The output 'out' directly reflects the current MSB of the shift register.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) of the shift register.\n- Bit[3] refers to the most significant bit (MSB) of the shift register.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- During synchronous reset (resetn = '0'), all bits in the shift register are cleared to '0' on the next rising clock edge.\n- If resetn is held low across multiple clock cycles, the shift register remains in the reset state with all bits '0'.\n                    "
