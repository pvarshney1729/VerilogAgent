The reset is also handled synchronously within this block, resetting the state to A when active. The next state logic is combinational and determines the next state based on the current state and input.

The state machine has four states: A, B, C, and D, which we encode using a 2-bit `logic` type. The state transitions and outputs are defined based on the input `in` and the current state. We use a synchronous reset to ensure the FSM resets to state A on the rising edge of the clock when `reset` is high. The output depends solely on the current state, adhering to the Moore machine principles. We use `always @(*)` for combinational logic to determine the next state and output based on the current state and input. The state transition logic is implemented in an `always @(posedge clk)` block to ensure synchronous operation.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic in,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [1:0] {\n        STATE_A = 2'b00,\n        STATE_B = 2'b01,\n        STATE_C = 2'b10,\n        STATE_D = 2'b11\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic with synchronous reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A; // Reset to state A\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (in) ?
