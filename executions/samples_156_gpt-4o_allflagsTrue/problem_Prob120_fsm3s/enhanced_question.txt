Module Name: TopModule

Port Definition:
- input  logic clk           // Clock signal, positive edge-triggered
- input  logic reset         // Synchronous active high reset signal
- input  logic in            // Input signal with single bit width
- output logic out           // Output signal with single bit width

State Machine Specification:
- Type: Moore State Machine
- Number of States: 4
- State Encoding: Binary (2-bit representation)
  - State A: 2'b00
  - State B: 2'b01
  - State C: 2'b10
  - State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table:
- Current State | Next State with in=0 | Next State with in=1 | Output
  - A (2'b00)   | A (2'b00)            | B (2'b01)            | 0
  - B (2'b01)   | C (2'b10)            | B (2'b01)            | 0
  - C (2'b10)   | A (2'b00)            | D (2'b11)            | 0
  - D (2'b11)   | C (2'b10)            | B (2'b01)            | 1

Reset Behavior:
- The reset signal is synchronous and active high.
- On the positive edge of the clock, if reset is high, the FSM transitions to State A (2'b00).
- All registers should initialize to zero unless reset is active, which forces the FSM to State A.

Clock and Reset:
- All sequential logic is triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The reset initializes the state machine to State A, irrespective of the current state or inputs.

Output Logic:
- The output depends solely on the current state, in accordance with Moore machine principles.
- The output is '0' for states A, B, and C; and '1' for state D.

Edge Cases:
- During the reset condition, the FSM immediately transitions to State A and the output is '0'.
- The state transitions and output are evaluated on the rising edge of clk, ensuring synchronous operation and preventing race conditions.
