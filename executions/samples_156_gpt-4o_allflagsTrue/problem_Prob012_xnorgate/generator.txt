<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that functions as an XNOR gate. The module has two single-bit inputs, `a` and `b`, and a single-bit output, `out`. The XNOR operation is defined as the negation of the XOR operation, which can be expressed as `out = ~(a ^ b)`. This is a purely combinational logic operation, so we will use an `assign` statement to directly map the XNOR logic to the output.

According to the guidelines, we should use `logic` for port declarations instead of `wire` or `reg`. Since this is a simple combinational logic, there is no need for an `always` block, and we can directly use an `assign` statement to implement the logic. There is no mention of a clock or reset signal in the original specification, so we will not include those in our implementation.

The coding conventions also specify that we should not use an `always` block for combinational logic unless necessary, and since our logic does not require reading any signals in an `always` block, we will use an `assign` statement.

The module will strictly adhere to the provided interface and signal names.
