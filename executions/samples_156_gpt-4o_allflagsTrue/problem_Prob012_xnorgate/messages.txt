Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specifications:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input signal.\n  - `input wire b`: Single-bit input signal.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output wire out`: Single-bit output signal, representing the result of the XNOR operation on inputs `a` and `b`.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module `TopModule` implements a single-bit XNOR gate.\n- The XNOR operation is defined as: `out = ~(a ^ b)`\n  - This means the output `out` will be high ('1') when both inputs `a` and `b` are the same, and low ('0') when the inputs differ.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- All signals are active high, meaning a logic level of '1' represents a true or active state.\n- The bit indexing is not applicable here as all signals are single-bit.\n\nLogic Type:\n- The logic implemented in this module is purely combinational, with no clock or sequential elements involved.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- Since the inputs are single-bit, the possible combinations are limited to four: (a=0, b=0), (a=0, b=1), (a=1, b=0), and (a=1, b=1).\n- The output `out` will be '1' for the combinations (a=0, b=0) and (a=1, b=1), and '0' for the combinations (a=0, b=1) and (a=1, b=0).\n\nReset Conditions:\n- Not applicable, as the module is purely combinational and does not involve any sequential elements or registers.\n\nTiming and Performance:\n- The output `out` reflects the combination of inputs `a` and `b` without any propagation delay described in this specification.\n\nPrecedence and Dependencies:\n- There are no dependencies on additional signals or states outside of the provided inputs `a` and `b`.\n- The operation precedence follows standard logical operation rules, where the XOR operation (^) is evaluated before the NOT operation (~).\n                    "
