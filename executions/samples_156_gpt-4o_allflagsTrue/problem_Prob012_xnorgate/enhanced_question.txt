Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire b`: Single-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: Single-bit output signal, representing the result of the XNOR operation on inputs `a` and `b`.

Functional Description:
- The module `TopModule` implements a single-bit XNOR gate.
- The XNOR operation is defined as: `out = ~(a ^ b)`
  - This means the output `out` will be high ('1') when both inputs `a` and `b` are the same, and low ('0') when the inputs differ.

Signal Conventions:
- All signals are active high, meaning a logic level of '1' represents a true or active state.
- The bit indexing is not applicable here as all signals are single-bit.

Logic Type:
- The logic implemented in this module is purely combinational, with no clock or sequential elements involved.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- Since the inputs are single-bit, the possible combinations are limited to four: (a=0, b=0), (a=0, b=1), (a=1, b=0), and (a=1, b=1).
- The output `out` will be '1' for the combinations (a=0, b=0) and (a=1, b=1), and '0' for the combinations (a=0, b=1) and (a=1, b=0).

Reset Conditions:
- Not applicable, as the module is purely combinational and does not involve any sequential elements or registers.

Timing and Performance:
- The output `out` reflects the combination of inputs `a` and `b` without any propagation delay described in this specification.

Precedence and Dependencies:
- There are no dependencies on additional signals or states outside of the provided inputs `a` and `b`.
- The operation precedence follows standard logical operation rules, where the XOR operation (^) is evaluated before the NOT operation (~).
