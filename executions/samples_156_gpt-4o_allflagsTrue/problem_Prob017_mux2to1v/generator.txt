<REASONING>
The task is to implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer with a 100-bit wide data path. The module should select between two 100-bit inputs, `a` and `b`, based on the value of a 1-bit selection signal `sel`. If `sel` is 0, the output `out` should be equal to `a`; if `sel` is 1, the output should be equal to `b`.

Given the guidelines and coding conventions:
- We use `logic` for all port declarations to adhere to the convention of not using `wire` or `reg`.
- The multiplexer logic is implemented using a continuous assignment with the `assign` statement, which is appropriate for combinational logic.
- The ternary operator (`? :`) is used to implement the selection logic, which is a concise way to express the multiplexer behavior.
- Since the operation is purely combinational, there is no need for an `always` block or a clock signal.
- There is no need for a synchronous reset or initialization in this purely combinational module.

The implementation is straightforward and directly follows from the specification and guidelines provided.
