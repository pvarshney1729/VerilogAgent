Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `a`: A 100-bit wide input vector, where `a[99]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `a[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `b`: A 100-bit wide input vector, where `b[99]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `b[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).
  - `sel`: A 1-bit input used as the selection signal for the multiplexer.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: A 100-bit wide output vector, where `out[99]` is the MSB and `out[0]` is the LSB.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer with a 100-bit wide data path.
- The output `out` is determined by the value of the selection input `sel`:
  - If `sel` is 0, `out` should be assigned the value of input `a`.
  - If `sel` is 1, `out` should be assigned the value of input `b`.

Operational Details:
- The operation of this module is purely combinational; there are no clock dependencies or sequential logic elements involved.
- There are no initial conditions or reset states required for this module as it does not contain any state-holding elements such as flip-flops or registers.

Boundary Conditions:
- The module handles all 100-bit inputs without restrictions on the bit values. All valid combinations of `a`, `b`, and `sel` should be supported.
- No additional conditions or edge cases are specified beyond the input size limits and selection logic.
