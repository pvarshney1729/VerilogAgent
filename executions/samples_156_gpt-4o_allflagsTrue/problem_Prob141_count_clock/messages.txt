        "content": "```xml\n<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the TopModule follows the specification and guidelines provided. The module is designed to function as a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indication, using BCD counters for hours, minutes, and seconds. The synchronous reset logic ensures that the clock resets to \"12:00:00 AM\" when the reset signal is asserted. The counters are incremented based on the enable signal, which simulates a pulse occurring once per second.\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs `clk`, `reset`, `ena`, and outputs `pm`, `hh`, `mm`, `ss`. All ports are declared as `logic` as per the coding conventions.\n\n2. **Internal Registers**: Internal registers are used to hold the BCD values for hours, minutes, and seconds. These are split into tens and ones for easier BCD manipulation.\n\n3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented within an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. When `reset` is high, the clock is set to \"12:00:00 AM\".\n\n4. **Seconds Counter**: The seconds counter increments from 00 to 59.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and conventions provided. The module is designed to function as a 12-hour clock with AM/PM indication. The clock increments every second when the `ena` signal is asserted. The synchronous reset has the highest priority and sets the clock to \"12:00:00 AM\" when asserted.\n\n1. **Port Declaration**: All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions. The `hh`, `mm`, and `ss` outputs are 8 bits wide to represent two BCD digits.\n\n2. **Internal Registers**: Internal logic registers are used to hold the BCD values for hours, minutes, and seconds. These are split into tens and ones for easier BCD manipulation.\n\n3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented within the `always @(posedge clk)` block. When `reset` is high, the clock is set to \"12:00:00 AM\", with `hh` set to BCD 12, `mm` and `ss` set to BCD 00, and `pm` set to 0 (AM).\n\n4. **Seconds Counter**: The seconds counter increments from 00 to 59 in BCD format. When it reaches 59, it resets to 00 and triggers the minutes counter to increment.\n\n5. **Minutes Counter**: The minutes counter increments from 00 to 59 in BCD format. When it reaches 59, it resets to 00 and triggers the hours counter to increment.\n\n6. **Hours Counter**: The hours counter increments from 01 to 12 in BCD format. When it reaches 12, it resets to 01 and toggles the `pm` signal to switch between AM and PM.\n\n7. **BCD Counting**: The BCD counting logic ensures that each digit is correctly incremented and reset according to BCD rules. The lower BCD digit resets from 9 to 0 and increments the higher BCD digit.\n\n8. **PM Toggle**: The `pm` signal toggles when the hours counter transitions from 12 to 01, indicating a switch between AM and PM.\n\nThe implementation ensures that all operations are synchronous with the clock and adhere to the specified behavior of the clock module.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic ena,\n    output logic pm,\n    output logic [7:0] hh,\n    output logic [7:0] mm,\n    output logic [7:0] ss\n);\n\n    // Internal registers for BCD counting\n    logic [3:0] hh_ones;\n    logic [3:0] hh_tens;\n    logic [3:0] mm_ones;\n    logic [3:0] mm_tens;\n    logic [3:0] ss_ones;\n    logic [3:0] ss_tens;\n\n    // Synchronous reset and clock logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            hh <= 8'b0001_0010; // 12 in BCD\n            mm <= 8'b0000_0000; // 00 in BCD\n            ss <= 8'b0000_0000; // 00 in BCD\n            pm <= 1'b0;         // AM\n        end else if (ena) begin\n            // Seconds counter\n            if (ss == 8'b0101_1001) begin // 59 in BCD\n                ss <= 8'b0000_0000; // Reset to 00\n                // Minutes counter\n                if (mm == 8'b0101_1001) begin // 59 in BCD\n                    mm <= 8'b0000_0000; // Reset to 00\n                    // Hours counter\n                    if (hh == 8'b0001_0010) begin // 12 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0000_0001; // Reset to 01\n                        pm <= ~pm; // Toggle PM\n                    end else if (hh == 8'b0000_1001) begin // 09 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0001_0000; // Increment to 10\n                    end else if (hh == 8'b0001_0000) begin // 10 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0001_0001; // Increment to 11\n                    end else if (hh == 8'b0001_0001) begin // 11 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0001_0010; // Increment to 12\n                    end else begin\n                        hh <= hh + 1; // Increment hours\n                    end\n                end else begin\n                    if (mm[3:0] == 4'b1001) begin // Lower BCD digit is 9\n                        mm <= {mm[7:4] + 1'b1, 4'b0000}; // Increment tens place\n                    end else begin\n                        mm <= mm + 1; // Increment minutes\n                    end\n                end\n            end else begin\n                if (ss[3:0] == 4'b1001) begin // Lower BCD digit is 9\n                    ss <= {ss[7:4] + 1'b1, 4'b0000}; // Increment tens place\n                end else begin\n                    ss <= ss + 1; // Increment seconds\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

The module handles the synchronous reset, which sets the clock to \"12:00:00 AM\" when asserted. The enable signal (`ena`) allows the clock to increment by one second on each positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n\n1. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented to set the hours (`hh`) to 12, minutes (`mm`), and seconds (`ss`) to 00, and the PM indicator (`pm`) to 0 (AM) when the reset signal is high. This reset logic has the highest priority.\n\n2. **Seconds Counter**: The seconds counter (`ss`) increments from 00 to 59 in BCD format. When it reaches 59, it resets to 00 and triggers the increment of the minutes counter.\n\n3. **Minutes Counter**: The minutes counter (`mm`) operates similarly to the seconds counter, incrementing from 00 to 59. When it reaches 59, it resets to 00 and triggers the increment of the hours counter.\n\n4. **Hours Counter**: The hours counter (`hh`) increments from 01 to 12 in BCD format. When it reaches 12, it resets to 01 and toggles the PM indicator (`pm`). The transition from 11 to 12 and from 12 to 01 is handled explicitly to ensure correct BCD representation.\n\n5. **PM Indicator**: The PM indicator (`pm`) toggles when the hours counter transitions from 12 to 01, indicating a change from AM to PM or vice versa.\n\nThe implementation adheres to the provided interface and coding conventions, ensuring correct BCD counting and synchronous reset behavior.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic ena,\n    output logic pm,\n    output logic [7:0] hh,\n    output logic [7:0] mm,\n    output logic [7:0] ss\n);\n\n    // Internal registers for BCD counting\n    logic [3:0] hh_ones;\n    logic [3:0] hh_tens;\n    logic [3:0] mm_ones;\n    logic [3:0] mm_tens;\n    logic [3:0] ss_ones;\n    logic [3:0] ss_tens;\n\n    // Synchronous reset and clock logic\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            hh <= 8'b0001_0010; // 12 in BCD\n            mm <= 8'b0000_0000; // 00 in BCD\n            ss <= 8'b0000_0000; // 00 in BCD\n            pm <= 1'b0;         // AM\n        end else if (ena) begin\n            // Seconds counter\n            if (ss == 8'b0101_1001) begin // 59 in BCD\n                ss <= 8'b0000_0000; // Reset to 00\n                // Minutes counter\n                if (mm == 8'b0101_1001) begin // 59 in BCD\n                    mm <= 8'b0000_0000; // Reset to 00\n                    // Hours counter\n                    if (hh == 8'b0001_0010) begin // 12 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0000_0001; // Reset to 01\n                        pm <= ~pm; // Toggle PM\n                    end else if (hh == 8'b0000_1001) begin // 09 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0001_0000; // Increment to 10\n                    end else if (hh == 8'b0001_0000) begin // 10 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0001_0001; // Increment to 11\n                    end else if (hh == 8'b0001_0001) begin // 11 in BCD\n                        hh <= 8'b0001_0010; // Increment to 12\n                    end else begin\n                        hh <= hh + 1; // Increment hours\n                    end\n                end else begin\n                    if (mm[3:0] == 4'b1001) begin // Lower BCD digit is 9\n                        mm <= {mm[7:4] + 1'b1, 4'b0000}; // Increment tens place\n                    end else begin\n                        mm <= mm + 1; // Increment minutes\n                    end\n                end\n            end else begin\n                if (ss[3:0] == 4'b1001) begin // Lower BCD digit is 9\n                    ss <= {ss[7:4] + 1'b1, 4'b0000}; // Increment tens place\n                end else begin\n                    ss <= ss + 1; // Increment seconds\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
