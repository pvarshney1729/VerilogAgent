<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and coding conventions specified. The module is designed to detect a specific pattern (1101) on the `data` input and then perform a series of operations based on the detected pattern. The finite-state machine (FSM) is implemented using an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the different states of the FSM. The states include `IDLE`, `S1`, `S11`, `S110`, `DETECTED`, `SHIFT`, `COUNT`, and `DONE_STATE`.

1. **Pattern Detection**: The FSM transitions through states `S1`, `S11`, and `S110` to detect the pattern `1101`. Once detected, it moves to the `DETECTED` state and then to the `SHIFT` state.

2. **Shifting Operation**: In the `SHIFT` state, the `shift_ena` signal is asserted for exactly 4 clock cycles, controlled by a `shift_counter`. After 4 cycles, the FSM transitions to the `COUNT` state.

3. **Counting Phase**: In the `COUNT` state, the `counting` signal is asserted, indicating that the module is waiting for the counting operation to complete. The FSM remains in this state until the `done_counting` input is high.

4. **Completion Notification**: Once `done_counting` is high, the FSM transitions to the `DONE_STATE`, where the `done` signal is asserted to notify the user. The FSM waits in this state until the `ack` input is high.

5. **Reset and Reinitialization**: The FSM resets to the `IDLE` state when the `ack` input is high, ready to detect the next occurrence of the pattern `1101`.

The synchronous reset is implemented by checking the `reset` signal within the `always_ff` block, ensuring that the FSM initializes to the `IDLE` state when reset is asserted. The module adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals and ensuring that all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
