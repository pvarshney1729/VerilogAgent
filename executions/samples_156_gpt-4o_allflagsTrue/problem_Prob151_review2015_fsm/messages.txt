Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\n**Interface:**\n- `input logic clk`: Clock signal for the module; positive edge-triggered.\n- `input logic reset`: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n- `input logic data`: Serial input data, used for pattern detection.\n- `input logic done_counting`: Indicates when the counting operation is complete.\n- `input logic ack`: Acknowledgment signal from the user.\n\n- `output logic shift_ena`: Control signal to enable shifting of bits.\n- `output logic counting`: Signal indicating the module is in counting mode.\n- `output logic done`: Signal indicating the timer has completed its operation.\n\n**Behavioral Description:**\n\n1. **Pattern Detection:** \n   - The module monitors the `data` input for the specific pattern `1101`.\n   - Upon detection of the pattern `1101`, the state machine transitions from its initial state to a state where it needs to shift in additional bits.\n\n2. **Shifting Operation:**\n   - After detecting the pattern, assert `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles. \n   - These 4 clock cycles are used to shift in additional bits that determine the delay duration.\n\n3. **Counting Phase:**\n   - Once the 4 bits are shifted in, assert the `counting` signal to indicate the state machine is waiting for the counting operation to complete.\n   - Remain in this state until the `done_counting` input is asserted high.\n\n4. **Completion Notification:**\n   - Upon `done_counting` being high, assert the `done` signal to notify the user that the timer has completed.\n   - Wait in this state until the `ack` input is asserted high by the user.\n\n5. **Reset and Reinitialization:**\n   - Once `ack` is high, the state machine resets to its initial state to begin monitoring for the next occurrence of the pattern `1101`.\n   - The module's reset is synchronous and will initialize the state machine to the pattern detection state.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Bit Indexing: `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).\n- All sequential elements are triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- Upon reset, the module will clear any pending operations and begin fresh pattern detection.\n                    "

The FSM is designed with the following states:\n\n1. **IDLE**: The initial state where the FSM waits for the detection of the pattern `1101` on the `data` input. The FSM transitions through intermediate states `S1`, `S11`, and `S110` to detect the pattern sequentially.\n\n2. **DETECTED**: Once the pattern `1101` is detected, the FSM transitions to this state, which immediately leads to the `SHIFT` state.\n\n3. **SHIFT**: In this state, the FSM asserts `shift_ena` for exactly 4 clock cycles to shift in additional bits. A `shift_counter` is used to count the 4 cycles.\n\n4. **COUNT**: After shifting, the FSM asserts `counting` and waits for the `done_counting` signal to be high, indicating that the counting operation is complete.\n\n5. **DONE_STATE**: Once `done_counting` is high, the FSM asserts `done` to notify the user.

After 4 cycles, the FSM transitions to the `COUNT` state.\n\n3. **Counting Phase**: In the `COUNT` state, the `counting` signal is asserted, indicating that the module is waiting for the counting operation to complete. The FSM remains in this state until the `done_counting` input is high.\n\n4. **Completion Notification**: Once `done_counting` is high, the FSM transitions to the `DONE_STATE`, where the `done` signal is asserted to notify the user. The FSM waits in this state until the `ack` input is high.\n\n5. **Reset and Reinitialization**: The FSM resets to the `IDLE` state when the `ack` input is high, ready to detect the next occurrence of the pattern `1101`.\n\nThe synchronous reset is implemented by checking the `reset` signal within the `always_ff` block, ensuring that the FSM initializes to the `IDLE` state when reset is asserted. The module adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals and ensuring that all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic data,\n    input logic done_counting,\n    input logic ack,\n    output logic shift_ena,\n    output logic counting,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE        = 3'b000,\n        S1          = 3'b001,\n        S11         = 3'b010,\n        S110        = 3'b011,\n        DETECTED    = 3'b100,\n        SHIFT       = 3'b101,\n        COUNT       = 3'b110,\n        DONE_STATE  = 3'b111\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] shift_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            shift_counter <= 2'b00;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == SHIFT) begin\n                shift_counter <= shift_counter + 1;\n            end else begin\n                shift_counter <= 2'b00;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        next_state = current_state; // Default to hold state\n        shift_ena = 1'b0;\n        counting = 1'b0;\n        done = 1'b0;\n\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (data) next_state = S1;\n            end\n            S1: begin\n                if (data) next_state = S11;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            S11: begin\n                if (!data) next_state = S110;\n                else next_state = S1;\n            end\n            S110: begin\n                if (data) next_state = DETECTED;\n                else next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            DETECTED: begin\n                next_state = SHIFT;\n            end\n            SHIFT: begin\n                shift_ena = 1'b1;\n                if (shift_counter == 2'b11) begin\n                    next_state = COUNT;\n                end\n            end\n            COUNT: begin\n                counting = 1'b1;\n                if (done_counting) begin\n                    next_state = DONE_STATE;\n                end\n            end\n            DONE_STATE: begin\n                done = 1'b1;\n                if (ack) begin\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n                end\n            end\n            default: next_state = IDLE;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
