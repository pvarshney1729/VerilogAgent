Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- `input  wire clk`: Clock signal, triggers state transitions on the rising edge.
- `input  wire reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal, resets the state machine to the initial state.
- `input  wire in`: Single-bit input to the state machine.
- `output reg out`: Single-bit output, determined by the current state of the state machine.

State Encoding:
- Use two states, encoded as 1-bit:
  - State B: 1'b0
  - State A: 1'b1

Initial State:
- On reset, the state machine transitions to State B.

Reset Behavior:
- The reset is synchronous, meaning the state transition to the initial state (State B) occurs on the rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.

State Transition Table (Moore State Machine):
- State B (out=1): 
  - `in=0`: Transition to State A.
  - `in=1`: Remain in State B.
- State A (out=0):
  - `in=0`: Transition to State B.
  - `in=1`: Remain in State A.

Output Logic:
- The output `out` is determined solely by the current state:
  - In State B, `out` = 1.
  - In State A, `out` = 0.

Bit Indexing:
- Consider the least significant bit (LSB) as bit[0].

Clock and Edge Sensitivity:
- All state transitions and reset logic are sensitive to the rising edge of `clk`.

Assumptions:
- The input `in` is stable and valid at the rising edge of `clk`.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that during reset, the output `out` reflects the corresponding state output value immediately after a clock edge occurs with `reset` high.
