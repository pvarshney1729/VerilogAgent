<REASONING>
To implement the Moore state machine as specified, we need to define a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The state machine has two states, A and B, with specific transitions based on the input `in`. The reset is synchronous and active-high, meaning the state machine should transition to state B when `reset` is high during a clock edge.

1. **State Encoding**: We use a 1-bit logic type to represent the states. State A is encoded as `1'b0` and state B as `1'b1`.

2. **State Transition Logic**: We use an `always` block triggered on the rising edge of `clk` to update the current state. If `reset` is high, the state is set to B. Otherwise, the state transitions based on the current state and input `in`.

3. **Next State Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `in`. This block does not include `reset` in the sensitivity list, adhering to the synchronous reset requirement.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state. In state B, `out` is `1`, and in state A, `out` is `0`. This is implemented using another `always @(*)` block.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, avoid explicit sensitivity lists in combinational logic, and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps and guidelines, we ensure the module behaves as a Moore state machine with the specified transitions and output logic.
