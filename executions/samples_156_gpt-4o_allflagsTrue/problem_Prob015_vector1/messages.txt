Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPurpose:\nThe TopModule is a combinational logic circuit designed to split a 16-bit input into two separate 8-bit outputs, one representing the lower byte and the other representing the upper byte of the input.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input [15:0] in`: A 16-bit wide input port where `in[15]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output [7:0] out_hi`: An 8-bit wide output port representing the upper byte of the input. It corresponds to `in[15:8]`.\n  - `output [7:0] out_lo`: An 8-bit wide output port representing the lower byte of the input. It corresponds to `in[7:0]`.\n\nOperational Description:\n- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clocked or sequential elements.\n- The output `out_hi` directly maps to the upper byte (`in[15:8]`) of the input.\n- The output `out_lo` directly maps to the lower byte (`in[7:0]`) of the input.\n- There are no reset conditions, as the module does not contain any state or memory elements.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundary Conditions:\n- The module handles all possible 16-bit input values by splitting them into the corresponding 8-bit outputs as described.\n- No additional edge case handling is required beyond the standard functionality.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure that the Verilog implementation correctly maps the specific bits from the input to the respective output ports as described in this specification.\n                    "
