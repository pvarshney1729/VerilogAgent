Module Name: TopModule

Purpose:
The TopModule is a combinational logic circuit designed to split a 16-bit input into two separate 8-bit outputs, one representing the lower byte and the other representing the upper byte of the input.

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [15:0] in`: A 16-bit wide input port where `in[15]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `output [7:0] out_hi`: An 8-bit wide output port representing the upper byte of the input. It corresponds to `in[15:8]`.
  - `output [7:0] out_lo`: An 8-bit wide output port representing the lower byte of the input. It corresponds to `in[7:0]`.

Operational Description:
- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clocked or sequential elements.
- The output `out_hi` directly maps to the upper byte (`in[15:8]`) of the input.
- The output `out_lo` directly maps to the lower byte (`in[7:0]`) of the input.
- There are no reset conditions, as the module does not contain any state or memory elements.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- The module handles all possible 16-bit input values by splitting them into the corresponding 8-bit outputs as described.
- No additional edge case handling is required beyond the standard functionality.

Note:
- Ensure that the Verilog implementation correctly maps the specific bits from the input to the respective output ports as described in this specification.
