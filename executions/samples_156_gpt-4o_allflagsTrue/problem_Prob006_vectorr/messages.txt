Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `in`: An 8-bit wide input port. Bit indexing follows the convention where `in[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: An 8-bit wide output port. The order of bits in `out` should be the reverse of the order in the input port `in`.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module performs a bit-reversal operation on the input port `in`. The output port `out` should be assigned the value of `in` with its bit order reversed. Specifically:\n  - `out[0]` should be assigned the value of `in[7]`\n  - `out[1]` should be assigned the value of `in[6]`\n  - `out[2]` should be assigned the value of `in[5]`\n  - `out[3]` should be assigned the value of `in[4]`\n  - `out[4]` should be assigned the value of `in[3]`\n  - `out[5]` should be assigned the value of `in[2]`\n  - `out[6]` should be assigned the value of `in[1]`\n  - `out[7]` should be assigned the value of `in[0]`\n\nAdditional Details:\n- This module implements purely combinational logic; there are no clocked elements or dependencies on any sequential logic.\n- As there are no sequential elements, there is no need for reset behavior to be defined.\n                    "
