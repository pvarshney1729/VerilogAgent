Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `in`: An 8-bit wide input port. Bit indexing follows the convention where `in[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: An 8-bit wide output port. The order of bits in `out` should be the reverse of the order in the input port `in`.

Functional Description:
- The module performs a bit-reversal operation on the input port `in`. The output port `out` should be assigned the value of `in` with its bit order reversed. Specifically:
  - `out[0]` should be assigned the value of `in[7]`
  - `out[1]` should be assigned the value of `in[6]`
  - `out[2]` should be assigned the value of `in[5]`
  - `out[3]` should be assigned the value of `in[4]`
  - `out[4]` should be assigned the value of `in[3]`
  - `out[5]` should be assigned the value of `in[2]`
  - `out[6]` should be assigned the value of `in[1]`
  - `out[7]` should be assigned the value of `in[0]`

Additional Details:
- This module implements purely combinational logic; there are no clocked elements or dependencies on any sequential logic.
- As there are no sequential elements, there is no need for reset behavior to be defined.
