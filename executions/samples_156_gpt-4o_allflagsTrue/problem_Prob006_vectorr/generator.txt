<REASONING>
The task is to reverse the bit order of an 8-bit input and assign it to an 8-bit output. This is a purely combinational logic operation, so we can use an `assign` statement to achieve this. The input bits are accessed in reverse order and concatenated to form the output. The guidelines specify using `logic` for port declarations and using `assign` for combinational logic, which is followed here. Since there is no clock or reset involved, the implementation is straightforward.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] out
);

    // Reverse the bit order of the input and assign to output
    assign out = {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]};

endmodule
[DONE]
