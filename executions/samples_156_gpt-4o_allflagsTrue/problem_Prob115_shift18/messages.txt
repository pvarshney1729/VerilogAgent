Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\n**Port Definitions:**\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal used for synchronous operations.\n- `input wire load`: Active-high control signal for loading data into the shift register.\n- `input wire ena`: Active-high control signal for enabling the shift operation.\n- `input wire [1:0] amount`: 2-bit control signal to determine the direction and magnitude of the shift.\n- `input wire [63:0] data`: 64-bit input data to be loaded into the shift register.\n- `output reg [63:0] q`: 64-bit output representing the current contents of the shift register.\n\n**Operational Details:**\n1. **Load Operation:**\n   - When `load` is high (`1`), the shift register is loaded with `data[63:0]` on the rising edge of `clk`.\n   - This operation takes precedence over the shift operation if `ena` is also high.\n\n2. **Shift Operation:**\n   - When `load` is low (`0`) and `ena` is high (`1`), the register performs a shift operation on the rising edge of `clk`.\n   - The `amount` signal specifies the direction and magnitude of the shift:\n     - `2'b00`: Shift the register left by 1 bit. The least significant bit (LSB) is filled with `0`.\n     - `2'b01`: Shift the register left by 8 bits. The least significant 8 bits are filled with zeros.\n     - `2'b10`: Perform an arithmetic right shift by 1 bit. This maintains the sign bit at `q[63]`.\n     - `2'b11`: Perform an arithmetic right shift by 8 bits. The most significant 8 bits are filled with the value of `q[63]`.\n\n3. **Clock and Reset Relationship:**\n   - The module operates on the positive edge of `clk`.\n   - No reset signal is specified; the initial state of `q` is undefined and should be considered random unless otherwise initialized in a simulation environment.\n\n4. **Bit Indexing:**\n   - `q[63]` is the most significant bit (MSB), and `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If both `ena` and `load` are high, the `load` operation will take precedence, and the shift will not occur on that clock cycle.\n   - If `ena` is low, the contents of `q` remain unchanged regardless of the `amount` value.\n\n**Note:** Ensure all operations are performed synchronously with respect to the `clk` signal.\n                    "
