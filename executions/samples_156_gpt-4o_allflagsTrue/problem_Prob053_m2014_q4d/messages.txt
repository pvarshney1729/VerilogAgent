Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, used as the triggering edge for the flip-flop. The flip-flop is sensitive to the positive edge.\n  - `in`: 1-bit data input to the XOR gate.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output from the D flip-flop and input to the XOR gate.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The circuit comprises a D flip-flop and a two-input XOR gate.\n- The XOR gate receives two inputs: \n  1. The input signal `in`.\n  2. The output signal `out` from the D flip-flop (feedback loop).\n- The XOR gate's output serves as the D input for the flip-flop.\n- The D flip-flop captures the XOR output on the rising edge (positive edge) of the `clk` signal.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The flip-flop is positive edge-triggered; it captures the input data (from the XOR) on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n- There is no reset signal; hence, the initial state of the flip-flop's output `out` is undefined at power-up and may require initialization externally if deterministic behavior is required.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- All signal indices refer to the least significant bit (LSB) as position 0.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Given the absence of a reset, ensure that external systems using this module handle potential unknown states post power-up.\n- The XOR operation is executed before the clock's rising edge, ensuring stable input to the flip-flop at the clock event.\n\nNote: The module does not include any reset functionality; therefore, care should be taken to handle the initial state externally if necessary.\n                    "
