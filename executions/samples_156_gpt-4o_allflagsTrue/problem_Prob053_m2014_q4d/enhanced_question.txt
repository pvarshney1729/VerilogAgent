Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal, used as the triggering edge for the flip-flop. The flip-flop is sensitive to the positive edge.
  - `in`: 1-bit data input to the XOR gate.

- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output from the D flip-flop and input to the XOR gate.

Functional Description:
- The circuit comprises a D flip-flop and a two-input XOR gate.
- The XOR gate receives two inputs: 
  1. The input signal `in`.
  2. The output signal `out` from the D flip-flop (feedback loop).
- The XOR gate's output serves as the D input for the flip-flop.
- The D flip-flop captures the XOR output on the rising edge (positive edge) of the `clk` signal.

Sequential Logic:
- The flip-flop is positive edge-triggered; it captures the input data (from the XOR) on the rising edge of the `clk`.
- There is no reset signal; hence, the initial state of the flip-flop's output `out` is undefined at power-up and may require initialization externally if deterministic behavior is required.

Signal Conventions:
- All signal indices refer to the least significant bit (LSB) as position 0.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Given the absence of a reset, ensure that external systems using this module handle potential unknown states post power-up.
- The XOR operation is executed before the clock's rising edge, ensuring stable input to the flip-flop at the clock event.

Note: The module does not include any reset functionality; therefore, care should be taken to handle the initial state externally if necessary.
