The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of a Lemming in the game. The FSM has seven states: WALK_LEFT, WALK_RIGHT, FALL_LEFT, FALL_RIGHT, DIG_LEFT, DIG_RIGHT, and SPLATTER. Each state corresponds to a specific behavior of the Lemming, such as walking, falling, or digging.

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit logic vector. This allows for efficient state transitions and output logic.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The `always @(*)` block determines the next state based on the current state and inputs. The transitions are prioritized as follows:
   - Falling has the highest priority and occurs when `ground` is 0.
   - Digging is the next priority and occurs when `dig` is 1 and `ground` is 1.
   - Direction switching occurs if bumped while on the ground.

3. **Sequential Logic**: The `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block updates the current state and fall counter. The asynchronous reset (`areset`) sets the FSM to the initial state (WALK_LEFT) and resets the fall counter.

4. **Fall Counter**: A 5-bit counter tracks the duration of a fall. If the Lemming falls for more than 20 cycles and then hits the ground, it transitions to the SPLATTER state.

5. **Output Logic**: The outputs are determined solely by the current state, consistent with a Moore machine. The outputs are set based on whether the Lemming is walking, falling, or digging.

6. **SPLATTER State**: Once in the SPLATTER state, the Lemming remains there, and all outputs are set to 0, indicating the Lemming has splattered.

This implementation adheres to the provided interface and coding conventions, ensuring correct behavior and efficient operation.
