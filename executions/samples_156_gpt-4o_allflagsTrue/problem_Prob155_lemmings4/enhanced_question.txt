Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Inputs:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.
  - areset: 1-bit asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the FSM to the initial state (walking left) immediately upon activation.
  - bump_left: 1-bit signal indicating a bump on the left side.
  - bump_right: 1-bit signal indicating a bump on the right side.
  - ground: 1-bit signal indicating whether the ground is present (1) or absent (0).
  - dig: 1-bit signal to initiate digging.

- Outputs:
  - walk_left: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is walking left.
  - walk_right: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is walking right.
  - aaah: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is falling.
  - digging: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is digging.

Finite State Machine (FSM) Description:
- States:
  1. WALK_LEFT: Lemming is walking to the left.
  2. WALK_RIGHT: Lemming is walking to the right.
  3. FALLING_LEFT: Lemming is falling while initially walking left.
  4. FALLING_RIGHT: Lemming is falling while initially walking right.
  5. DIGGING_LEFT: Lemming is digging while initially walking left.
  6. DIGGING_RIGHT: Lemming is digging while initially walking right.
  7. SPLATTERED: Lemming has splattered and all outputs are 0.

- State Transitions:
  - Upon areset: Transition to WALK_LEFT.
  - From WALK_LEFT:
    - If ground = 0: Transition to FALLING_LEFT.
    - Else if dig = 1 and ground = 1: Transition to DIGGING_LEFT.
    - Else if bump_left = 1 or bump_right = 1: Transition to WALK_RIGHT.
  - From WALK_RIGHT:
    - If ground = 0: Transition to FALLING_RIGHT.
    - Else if dig = 1 and ground = 1: Transition to DIGGING_RIGHT.
    - Else if bump_left = 1 or bump_right = 1: Transition to WALK_LEFT.
  - From FALLING_LEFT or FALLING_RIGHT:
    - If ground = 1 and fall duration â‰¤ 20 cycles: Transition to the respective WALK state.
    - If ground = 1 and fall duration > 20 cycles: Transition to SPLATTERED.
  - From DIGGING_LEFT or DIGGING_RIGHT:
    - If ground = 0: Transition to the respective FALLING state.
  - SPLATTERED: Remains in SPLATTERED state indefinitely unless areset is activated.

- Output Logic:
  - WALK_LEFT: walk_left = 1, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0, digging = 0.
  - WALK_RIGHT: walk_left = 0, walk_right = 1, aaah = 0, digging = 0.
  - FALLING_LEFT or FALLING_RIGHT: walk_left = 0, walk_right = 0, aaah = 1, digging = 0.
  - DIGGING_LEFT or DIGGING_RIGHT: walk_left = 0, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0, digging = 1.
  - SPLATTERED: walk_left = 0, walk_right = 0, aaah = 0, digging = 0.

- Initial Values:
  - On areset, the FSM is set to WALK_LEFT.
  - The fall duration counter resets to 0 whenever a Lemming hits the ground after falling.

- Precedence of Actions:
  1. Falling: If ground = 0, falling has the highest priority.
  2. Digging: If ground = 1 and dig = 1, digging takes precedence over direction switching.
  3. Direction Switching: Changes direction if bumped while on the ground.

- Clock Cycle Relationships:
  - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of clk.
  - The fall duration counter increments every clock cycle while in the FALLING state.

- Boundary Conditions:
  - Simultaneous bumps (bump_left and bump_right) result in direction switch.
  - Dig commands while falling or without ground are ignored.
  - The FSM does not reset to a walking state automatically after SPLATTERED; requires areset.

This specification ensures that the Lemming's behavior, as modeled by the FSM, aligns with the described rules and priorities of the Lemmings' world.
