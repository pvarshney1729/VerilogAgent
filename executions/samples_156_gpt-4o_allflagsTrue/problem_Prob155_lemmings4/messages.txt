All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  areset\n - input  bump_left\n - input  bump_right\n - input  ground\n - input  dig\n - output walk_left\n - output walk_right\n - output aaah\n - output digging\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple\nthat we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the\nLemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left\n(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch\ndirections if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped\non the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's\nbumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.\nIf it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch\ndirections.\n\nIn addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,\nwhen ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground\nreappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same\ndirection as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect\nthe walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground\ndisappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while\nstill falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n\nIn addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do\nuseful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig\nif it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will\ncontinue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that\npoint, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue\nwalking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with\nfalling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig\nwhen falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a\nwalking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of\nthese conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,\nwhich has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n\nAlthough Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable.\nIf a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In\nparticular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits\nthe ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all\n4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no\nupper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.\nLemmings only splatter when hitting the ground; they do not splatter in\nmid-air.\n\nImplement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is\npositive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk\nleft.\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n\n"

Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specifications:\n- Inputs:\n  - clk: 1-bit clock signal, triggers on the positive edge.\n  - areset: 1-bit asynchronous reset signal, active high. Resets the FSM to the initial state (walking left) immediately upon activation.\n  - bump_left: 1-bit signal indicating a bump on the left side.\n  - bump_right: 1-bit signal indicating a bump on the right side.\n  - ground: 1-bit signal indicating whether the ground is present (1) or absent (0).\n  - dig: 1-bit signal to initiate digging.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - walk_left: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is walking left.\n  - walk_right: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is walking right.\n  - aaah: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is falling.\n  - digging: 1-bit output, high when the Lemming is digging.\n\nFinite State Machine (FSM) Description:\n- States:\n  1.

FALLING_RIGHT: Lemming is falling while initially walking right.\n  5. DIGGING_LEFT: Lemming is digging while initially walking left.\n  6. DIGGING_RIGHT: Lemming is digging while initially walking right.\n  7.

Falling: If ground = 0, falling has the highest priority.\n  2. Digging: If ground = 1 and dig = 1, digging takes precedence over direction switching.\n  3. Direction Switching: Changes direction if bumped while on the ground.\n\n- Clock Cycle Relationships:\n  - All state transitions occur on the positive edge of clk.\n  - The fall duration counter increments every clock cycle while in the FALLING state.\n\n- Boundary Conditions:\n  - Simultaneous bumps (bump_left and bump_right) result in direction switch.\n  - Dig commands while falling or without ground are ignored.\n  - The FSM does not reset to a walking state automatically after SPLATTERED; requires areset.\n\nThis specification ensures that the Lemming's behavior, as modeled by the FSM, aligns with the described rules and priorities of the Lemmings' world.\n                    "

So simple\nthat we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the\nLemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left\n(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch\ndirections if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped\non the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's\nbumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.\nIf it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch\ndirections.\n\nIn addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,\nwhen ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground\nreappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same\ndirection as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect\nthe walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground\ndisappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while\nstill falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n\nIn addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do\nuseful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig\nif it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will\ncontinue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that\npoint, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue\nwalking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with\nfalling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig\nwhen falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a\nwalking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` is based on the finite state machine (FSM) design that models the behavior of a Lemming in the game. The FSM has seven states: WALK_LEFT, WALK_RIGHT, FALL_LEFT, FALL_RIGHT, DIG_LEFT, DIG_RIGHT, and SPLATTER. The state transitions are determined by the inputs: bump_left, bump_right, ground, and dig. The module uses an asynchronous reset (areset) to initialize the FSM to the WALK_LEFT state.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit enumeration. This allows for easy state transitions and output logic determination.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An always block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs. The transitions prioritize falling over digging and direction switching. The SPLATTER state is reached if the Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles before hitting the ground.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic**: Another always block is used to update the current state and fall counter on the positive edge of the clock or when areset is high. The fall counter increments when the Lemming is in a falling state and resets when it hits the ground.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The outputs are determined based on the current state. The walk_left and walk_right outputs are high when the Lemming is walking in the respective direction. The aaah output is high when the Lemming is falling, and the digging output is high when the Lemming is digging.\n\n5. **Asynchronous Reset**: The areset input is used to asynchronously reset the FSM to the WALK_LEFT state and reset the fall counter to zero.\n\nBy following these steps, the module accurately models the behavior of a Lemming as described in the problem statement.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic bump_left,\n    input logic bump_right,\n    input logic ground,\n    input logic dig,\n    output logic walk_left,\n    output logic walk_right,\n    output logic aaah,\n    output logic digging\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        WALK_LEFT = 3'b000,\n        WALK_RIGHT = 3'b001,\n        FALL_LEFT = 3'b010,\n        FALL_RIGHT = 3'b011,\n        DIG_LEFT = 3'b100,\n        DIG_RIGHT = 3'b101,\n        SPLATTER = 3'b110\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [4:0] fall_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default next state\n        next_state = current_state;\n        \n        case (current_state)\n            WALK_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_LEFT;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIG_LEFT;\n                else if (bump_left || bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n            end\n            WALK_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_RIGHT;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIG_RIGHT;\n                else if (bump_left || bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n            end\n            FALL_LEFT: begin\n                if (ground) begin\n                    if (fall_counter > 5'd20)\n                        next_state = SPLATTER;\n                    else\n                        next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n                end\n            end\n            FALL_RIGHT: begin\n                if (ground) begin\n                    if (fall_counter > 5'd20)\n                        next_state = SPLATTER;\n                    else\n                        next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n                end\n            end\n            DIG_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_LEFT;\n            end\n            DIG_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_RIGHT;\n            end\n            SPLATTER: begin\n                // Remain in SPLATTER state\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Sequential logic for state and fall counter\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= WALK_LEFT;\n            fall_counter <= 5'd0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == FALL_LEFT || current_state == FALL_RIGHT)\n                fall_counter <= fall_counter + 1;\n            else\n                fall_counter <= 5'd0;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        walk_left = (current_state == WALK_LEFT);\n        walk_right = (current_state == WALK_RIGHT);\n        aaah = (current_state == FALL_LEFT || current_state == FALL_RIGHT);\n        digging = (current_state == DIG_LEFT || current_state == DIG_RIGHT);\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

Each state corresponds to a specific behavior of the Lemming.\n\n2. **State Transitions**: \n   - From walking states, the Lemming can transition to falling if ground is 0, to digging if dig is 1 and ground is 1, or switch directions if bumped.\n   - From falling states, the Lemming transitions back to the respective walking state if ground is 1, unless it has fallen for more than 20 cycles, in which case it transitions to splattered.\n   - From digging states, the Lemming transitions to falling if ground becomes 0.\n   - The splattered state is terminal unless reset.\n\n3. **Output Logic**: The outputs (walk_left, walk_right, aaah, digging) are determined by the current state. For instance, walk_left is high when in the WALK_LEFT state, and aaah is high when in any falling state.\n\n4. **Asynchronous Reset**: The FSM resets to the WALK_LEFT state when areset is high, regardless of the clock.\n\n5. **Fall Counter**: A counter tracks the number of cycles spent in a falling state to determine if the Lemming should splatter.\n\nThis design ensures that the Lemming behaves according to the specified rules, with precedence given to falling, then digging, and finally direction switching.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic bump_left,\n    input logic bump_right,\n    input logic ground,\n    input logic dig,\n    output logic walk_left,\n    output logic walk_right,\n    output logic aaah,\n    output logic digging\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        WALK_LEFT = 3'b000,\n        WALK_RIGHT = 3'b001,\n        FALL_LEFT = 3'b010,\n        FALL_RIGHT = 3'b011,\n        DIG_LEFT = 3'b100,\n        DIG_RIGHT = 3'b101,\n        SPLATTER = 3'b110\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [4:0] fall_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default next state\n        next_state = current_state;\n        \n        case (current_state)\n            WALK_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_LEFT;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIG_LEFT;\n                else if (bump_left || bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n            end\n            WALK_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_RIGHT;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIG_RIGHT;\n                else if (bump_left || bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n            end\n            FALL_LEFT: begin\n                if (ground) begin\n                    if (fall_counter > 5'd20)\n                        next_state = SPLATTER;\n                    else\n                        next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n                end\n            end\n            FALL_RIGHT: begin\n                if (ground) begin\n                    if (fall_counter > 5'd20)\n                        next_state = SPLATTER;\n                    else\n                        next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n                end\n            end\n            DIG_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_LEFT;\n            end\n            DIG_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_RIGHT;\n            end\n            SPLATTER: begin\n                // Remain in SPLATTER state\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Sequential logic for state and fall counter\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= WALK_LEFT;\n            fall_counter <= 5'd0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == FALL_LEFT || current_state == FALL_RIGHT)\n                fall_counter <= fall_counter + 1;\n            else\n                fall_counter <= 5'd0;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        walk_left = (current_state == WALK_LEFT);\n        walk_right = (current_state == WALK_RIGHT);\n        aaah = (current_state == FALL_LEFT || current_state == FALL_RIGHT);\n        digging = (current_state == DIG_LEFT || current_state == DIG_RIGHT);\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"

All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  areset\n - input  bump_left\n - input  bump_right\n - input  ground\n - input  dig\n - output walk_left\n - output walk_right\n - output aaah\n - output digging\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple\nthat we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the\nLemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left\n(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch\ndirections if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped\non the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's\nbumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.\nIf it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch\ndirections.\n\nIn addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,\nwhen ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground\nreappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same\ndirection as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect\nthe walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground\ndisappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while\nstill falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n\nIn addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do\nuseful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig\nif it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will\ncontinue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that\npoint, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue\nwalking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with\nfalling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig\nwhen falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a\nwalking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of\nthese conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,\nwhich has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n\nAlthough Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable.\nIf a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In\nparticular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits\nthe ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all\n4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no\nupper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.\nLemmings only splatter when hitting the ground; they do not splatter in\nmid-air.\n\nImplement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is\npositive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk\nleft.\n\nAssume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the\nclock.\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification of a Moore finite state machine (FSM) to model the behavior of a Lemming in the game. The FSM has seven states: WALK_LEFT, WALK_RIGHT, FALL_LEFT, FALL_RIGHT, DIG_LEFT, DIG_RIGHT, and SPLATTER. Each state corresponds to a specific behavior of the Lemming, such as walking, falling, or digging.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit logic vector. This allows for efficient state transitions and output logic.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The `always @(*)` block determines the next state based on the current state and inputs. The transitions are prioritized as follows:\n   - Falling has the highest priority and occurs when `ground` is 0.\n   - Digging is the next priority and occurs when `dig` is 1 and `ground` is 1.\n   - Direction switching occurs if bumped while on the ground.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic**: The `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)` block updates the current state and fall counter. The asynchronous reset (`areset`) sets the FSM to the initial state (WALK_LEFT) and resets the fall counter.\n\n4. **Fall Counter**: A 5-bit counter tracks the duration of a fall. If the Lemming falls for more than 20 cycles and then hits the ground, it transitions to the SPLATTER state.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: The outputs are determined solely by the current state, consistent with a Moore machine. The outputs are set based on whether the Lemming is walking, falling, or digging.\n\n6. **SPLATTER State**: Once in the SPLATTER state, the Lemming remains there, and all outputs are set to 0, indicating the Lemming has splattered.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the provided interface and coding conventions, ensuring correct behavior and efficient operation.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic areset,\n    input logic bump_left,\n    input logic bump_right,\n    input logic ground,\n    input logic dig,\n    output logic walk_left,\n    output logic walk_right,\n    output logic aaah,\n    output logic digging\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        WALK_LEFT = 3'b000,\n        WALK_RIGHT = 3'b001,\n        FALL_LEFT = 3'b010,\n        FALL_RIGHT = 3'b011,\n        DIG_LEFT = 3'b100,\n        DIG_RIGHT = 3'b101,\n        SPLATTER = 3'b110\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [4:0] fall_counter;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        // Default next state\n        next_state = current_state;\n        \n        case (current_state)\n            WALK_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_LEFT;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIG_LEFT;\n                else if (bump_left || bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n            end\n            WALK_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_RIGHT;\n                else if (dig)\n                    next_state = DIG_RIGHT;\n                else if (bump_left || bump_right)\n                    next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n            end\n            FALL_LEFT: begin\n                if (ground) begin\n                    if (fall_counter > 5'd20)\n                        next_state = SPLATTER;\n                    else\n                        next_state = WALK_LEFT;\n                end\n            end\n            FALL_RIGHT: begin\n                if (ground) begin\n                    if (fall_counter > 5'd20)\n                        next_state = SPLATTER;\n                    else\n                        next_state = WALK_RIGHT;\n                end\n            end\n            DIG_LEFT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_LEFT;\n            end\n            DIG_RIGHT: begin\n                if (!ground)\n                    next_state = FALL_RIGHT;\n            end\n            SPLATTER: begin\n                // Remain in SPLATTER state\n            end\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    // Sequential logic for state and fall counter\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin\n        if (areset) begin\n            current_state <= WALK_LEFT;\n            fall_counter <= 5'd0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == FALL_LEFT || current_state == FALL_RIGHT)\n                fall_counter <= fall_counter + 1;\n            else\n                fall_counter <= 5'd0;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Output logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        walk_left = (current_state == WALK_LEFT);\n        walk_right = (current_state == WALK_RIGHT);\n        aaah = (current_state == FALL_LEFT || current_state == FALL_RIGHT);\n        digging = (current_state == DIG_LEFT || current_state == DIG_RIGHT);\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
