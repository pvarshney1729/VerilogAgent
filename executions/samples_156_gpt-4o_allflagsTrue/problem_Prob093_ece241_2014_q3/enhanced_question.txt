Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - c: 1-bit, unsigned
  - d: 1-bit, unsigned
- Outputs:
  - mux_in: 4-bit vector, unsigned, with bit indexing such that mux_in[3] is the most significant bit (MSB) and mux_in[0] is the least significant bit (LSB)

Functional Description:
- The TopModule is responsible for generating the 4-bit output vector `mux_in` based on the provided Karnaugh map. The values in the Karnaugh map are used to determine the output values of `mux_in` for each combination of inputs `c` and `d`.

Karnaugh Map Interpretation:
- The Karnaugh map provided is as follows, where `ab` select lines correspond to the mux inputs:
  
  ```
  ab
  cd  00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  ```

- Input `c` and `d` combinations determine the rows, and `a` and `b` (external to this module) determine the column selections for the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

Output Description:
- `mux_in` is connected to a 4-to-1 multiplexer such that:
  - mux_in[0] corresponds to `ab = 00`
  - mux_in[1] corresponds to `ab = 01`
  - mux_in[2] corresponds to `ab = 11`
  - mux_in[3] corresponds to `ab = 10`
  
- The values placed into `mux_in` are derived directly from the Karnaugh map for each `cd` input combination.

Implementation Constraints:
- Use one 4-to-1 multiplexer and as many 2-to-1 multiplexers as required, minimizing their count.
- Do not use any other logic gates.
- Use inputs `a` and `b` as the select inputs for the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

Assumptions:
- All input signals are stable and free from glitches before being sampled.
- There are no reset requirements or sequential elements within this module as it is purely combinational logic.

Note:
- This specification defines only the TopModule. The 4-to-1 multiplexer and the select signals `a` and `b` are assumed to be external to this module.
