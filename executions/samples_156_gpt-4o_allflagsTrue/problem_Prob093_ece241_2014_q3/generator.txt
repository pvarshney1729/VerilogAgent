<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that generates a 4-bit output `mux_in` based on the given Karnaugh map. The output `mux_in` is intended to be used as inputs to a 4-to-1 multiplexer, with external select lines `a` and `b`.

1. **Understanding the Karnaugh Map**: The map provides the desired output for each combination of inputs `c` and `d`, with the columns representing the select lines `a` and `b` of the 4-to-1 multiplexer.

2. **Mapping the Karnaugh Map to `mux_in`**:
   - `mux_in[0]` corresponds to `ab = 00`: From the K-map, this is `(~c & d) | (c & ~d) | (c & d)`, which simplifies to `(~d) | (c & d)`.
   - `mux_in[1]` corresponds to `ab = 01`: From the K-map, this is always `0`.
   - `mux_in[2]` corresponds to `ab = 11`: From the K-map, this is `c & d`.
   - `mux_in[3]` corresponds to `ab = 10`: From the K-map, this is `(~c & ~d) | (c & d) | (c & ~d)`, which simplifies to `d`.

3. **Implementation**: Using only 2-to-1 multiplexers and no additional logic gates, the logic for each bit of `mux_in` is implemented using simple assignments.

4. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all ports and signals, and `assign` statements for combinational logic.

5. **No Synchronous Reset**: The problem does not specify a need for a synchronous reset, so it is not included in the implementation.

The implementation is straightforward and directly maps the Karnaugh map to the output `mux_in` using minimal logic.
