The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specifications and guidelines:

1. **Module Interface**: The module is defined with the specified inputs (`clk`, `reset`, `w`) and output (`z`). All signals are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **State Encoding**: The FSM states are encoded using a 3-bit `enum` type, which provides a clear and readable representation of the states: `STATE_A`, `STATE_B`, `STATE_C`, `STATE_D`, `STATE_E`, and `STATE_F`.

3. **State Flip-Flops**: The state register (`current_state`) is updated on the positive edge of the clock. A synchronous active-high reset is implemented, which resets the FSM to `STATE_A`.

4. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the `next_state` based on the `current_state` and input `w`. This block implements the state transition table as specified.

5. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined based on the `current_state`. It is set to `1` in states `E` and `F`, and `0` otherwise. This logic is implemented in an `always @(*)` block for clarity and adherence to the guidelines.

6. **Guidelines Compliance**: The implementation follows the guidelines by using `logic` for all signals, employing `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the synchronous reset is correctly implemented without including `reset` in the sensitivity list of sequential logic.

7. **Code Structure**: The code is structured with separate always blocks for state transition and state flip-flops, as specified. The output logic is also separated for clarity.

Overall, the implementation is designed to be clear, maintainable, and compliant with the given specifications and coding conventions.
