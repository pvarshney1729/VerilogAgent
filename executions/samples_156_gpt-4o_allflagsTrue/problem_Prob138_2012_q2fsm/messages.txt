        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the guidelines and specifications provided. The module is designed to implement a finite state machine (FSM) with six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The FSM transitions between these states based on the input `w` and outputs a signal `z` based on the current state.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit logic vector, allowing for up to 8 unique states. This is more than sufficient for the 6 states required.\n\n2. **State Flip-Flops**: The current state is stored in a flip-flop that updates on the positive edge of the clock. A synchronous reset is implemented to set the state to A when `reset` is high.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: The next state is determined by the current state and the input `w`. This logic is implemented in a combinational always block using a case statement.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined by the current state. States E and F produce an output of 1, while all other states produce an output of 0. This is implemented in a separate combinational always block.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, avoiding explicit sensitivity lists, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nOverall, the implementation is structured to ensure clear separation of state storage, transition logic, and output logic, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State flip-flops with synchronous active-high reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (w) ?

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the FSM as specified, I followed these steps:\n\n1. **Module Declaration**: I declared the module `TopModule` with the specified inputs and outputs. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **State Encoding**: I defined an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the states A, B, C, D, E, and F using a 3-bit encoding. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n3. **State Flip-Flops**: I implemented the state flip-flops using an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The synchronous reset logic is included to reset the FSM to state A when `reset` is high.\n\n4. **State Transition Logic**: I used a combinational `always` block to define the state transition logic. The next state is determined based on the current state and the input `w`.\n\n5. **Output Logic**: I implemented the output logic for `z` using a combinational `always` block. The output `z` is set to 1 when the FSM is in states E or F, and 0 otherwise.\n\n6. **Coding Conventions**: I ensured that all coding conventions were followed, such as using `always @(*)` for combinational logic and not including `reset` in the sensitivity list of sequential logic.\n\nThis approach ensures that the FSM behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output logic.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B = 3'b001,\n        STATE_C = 3'b010,\n        STATE_D = 3'b011,\n        STATE_E = 3'b100,\n        STATE_F = 3'b101\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n\n    // State flip-flops with synchronous active-high reset\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n        end\n    end\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: next_state = (w) ?
