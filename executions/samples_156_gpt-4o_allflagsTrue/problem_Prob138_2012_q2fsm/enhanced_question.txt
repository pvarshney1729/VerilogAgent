Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input  logic clk           // Clock input, positive edge-triggered
- input  logic reset         // Synchronous active-high reset
- input  logic w             // Input signal
- output logic z             // Output signal

State Machine Description:
- The FSM has six states: A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- State transition and output are defined as follows:
  - State A: 
    - Transition to B on input w = 1
    - Remain in A on input w = 0
    - Output z = 0
  - State B: 
    - Transition to C on input w = 1
    - Transition to D on input w = 0
    - Output z = 0
  - State C: 
    - Transition to E on input w = 1
    - Transition to D on input w = 0
    - Output z = 0
  - State D: 
    - Transition to F on input w = 1
    - Transition to A on input w = 0
    - Output z = 0
  - State E: 
    - Remain in E on input w = 1
    - Transition to D on input w = 0
    - Output z = 1
  - State F: 
    - Transition to C on input w = 1
    - Transition to D on input w = 0
    - Output z = 1

State Encoding:
- Assign state codes using a 3-bit representation:
  - A: 3'b000
  - B: 3'b001
  - C: 3'b010
  - D: 3'b011
  - E: 3'b100
  - F: 3'b101

Reset and Initialization:
- On reset (active-high), the FSM transitions to state A.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning it occurs on the next positive clock edge when reset is high.
- All registers and flip-flops are initialized to their reset state upon reset.

Logic Description:
- Use separate always blocks for:
  - State transition logic: Define next state based on current state and input w.
  - State register logic: Update current state at each positive clock edge.
- Output logic for z can be implemented using either a continuous assignment or an always block depending on design preference.

Clock and Signal Timing:
- All sequential elements are triggered on the positive edge of clk.
- Ensure that all state transitions and output logic are free from race conditions by adhering to the specified clocking and reset strategy.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure proper handling of all state transitions, especially on the boundaries of state changes and reset activation.
- Validate behavior when input w changes synchronously with the clock edge.
