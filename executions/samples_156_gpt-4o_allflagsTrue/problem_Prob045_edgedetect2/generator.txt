<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specifications and guidelines. The module is designed to detect any edge (0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) in an 8-bit input vector `in`. The output vector `anyedge` is updated to reflect these transitions.

1. **Port Declaration**: The module has an 8-bit input `in` and an 8-bit output `anyedge`. The clock `clk` is used to synchronize the operations.

2. **Previous State Storage**: A register `prev_in` is used to store the state of the input vector from the previous clock cycle. This is necessary to detect changes between consecutive cycles.

3. **Edge Detection Logic**: The edge detection is performed using the XOR operation. For each bit, if the current state differs from the previous state, the XOR result will be 1, indicating an edge.

4. **Sequential Logic**: The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring that the operations are synchronized with the clock. The `anyedge` output is updated with the XOR result, and `prev_in` is updated with the current input state.

5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring that the `always` block is correctly structured for sequential logic.

This implementation effectively detects any edge in the input vector and updates the output accordingly, as per the original specification.
