Module Name: TopModule

Input/Output Ports:
- `input clk`: A single-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
- `input [7:0] in`: An 8-bit input vector where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.
- `output reg [7:0] anyedge`: An 8-bit output vector. Each bit corresponds to detecting an edge on the respective input bit.

Functional Description:
The module detects any transition (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) for each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in`. For each bit, if a transition is detected from one clock cycle to the next, the corresponding bit in the output vector `anyedge` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle.

Sequential Logic:
- The detection is based on comparing the input vector `in` at the current clock cycle to its state in the previous clock cycle.
- A register must be used to store the state of the input vector `in` from the previous clock cycle to facilitate edge detection.

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- All sequential operations are synchronous with the positive edge of the clock `clk`.
- The initial state of the output register `anyedge` should be explicitly initialized to 0 at system start-up.
- The behavior of the system under asynchronous or synchronous reset conditions is not specified in the original description; thus, the implementation assumes no reset behavior is required.

Edge Detection Logic:
- For each bit `i` in `in`, the corresponding bit in `anyedge` should be set to 1 if there is a change in the state of `in[i]` from the previous clock cycle to the current one.

Boundary Conditions:
- The behavior at the first clock cycle (system start-up) should be defined as no edge detected. Hence, `anyedge` should start at 0.

Notes:
- Ensure that no race conditions exist due to the synchronous operation of the edge detection mechanism.
