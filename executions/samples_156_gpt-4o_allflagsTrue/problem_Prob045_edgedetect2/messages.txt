Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInput/Output Ports:\n- `input clk`: A single-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n- `input [7:0] in`: An 8-bit input vector where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n- `output reg [7:0] anyedge`: An 8-bit output vector. Each bit corresponds to detecting an edge on the respective input bit.\n\nFunctional Description:\nThe module detects any transition (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) for each bit in the 8-bit input vector `in`. For each bit, if a transition is detected from one clock cycle to the next, the corresponding bit in the output vector `anyedge` is set to 1 in the following clock cycle.\n\nSequential Logic:\n- The detection is based on comparing the input vector `in` at the current clock cycle to its state in the previous clock cycle.\n- A register must be used to store the state of the input vector `in` from the previous clock cycle to facilitate edge detection.\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- All sequential operations are synchronous with the positive edge of the clock `clk`.\n- The initial state of the output register `anyedge` should be explicitly initialized to 0 at system start-up.\n- The behavior of the system under asynchronous or synchronous reset conditions is not specified in the original description; thus, the implementation assumes no reset behavior is required.\n\nEdge Detection Logic:\n- For each bit `i` in `in`, the corresponding bit in `anyedge` should be set to 1 if there is a change in the state of `in[i]` from the previous clock cycle to the current one.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n- The behavior at the first clock cycle (system start-up) should be defined as no edge detected. Hence, `anyedge` should start at 0.\n\nNotes:\n- Ensure that no race conditions exist due to the synchronous operation of the edge detection mechanism.\n                    "
