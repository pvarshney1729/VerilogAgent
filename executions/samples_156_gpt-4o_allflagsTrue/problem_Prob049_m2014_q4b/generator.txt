<REASONING>
To implement the D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare a module named `TopModule` with the specified interface. The inputs are `clk`, `ar`, and `d`, and the output is `q`.

2. **Signal Declaration**: According to the coding conventions, all ports are declared as `logic`.

3. **Asynchronous Reset**: The asynchronous reset (`ar`) is active high. This means that when `ar` is high, the output `q` should be reset to '0' immediately, regardless of the clock.

4. **Positive Edge-Triggered**: The flip-flop should capture the value of `d` on the rising edge of `clk` if the reset is not active.

5. **Always Block**: We use an `always` block with `posedge clk or posedge ar` in the sensitivity list to handle both the clock edge and the asynchronous reset.

6. **Behavioral Logic**: Inside the `always` block, we first check if `ar` is high. If so, we set `q` to '0'. Otherwise, on the rising edge of `clk`, we set `q` to the value of `d`.

This approach ensures that the flip-flop behaves correctly with respect to both the clock and the asynchronous reset.
