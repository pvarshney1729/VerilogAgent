Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n\n- Inputs:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal. The module is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `input ar`: Asynchronous reset signal. Active high, meaning when `ar` is '1', the reset is asserted.\n  - `input d`: Data input for the D flip-flop.\n\n- Output:\n  - `output reg q`: Data output. This is a registered output, representing the stored value in the D flip-flop.\n\nFunctionality:\n\nThe module implements a D flip-flop with the following characteristics:\n\n1. **Positive Edge-Triggered**: The value of `d` is sampled and stored in `q` on the rising edge of `clk`, provided the asynchronous reset `ar` is not active.\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset**: \n   - The reset is active high. When `ar` is asserted ('1'), the output `q` is immediately reset to '0', regardless of the clock state.\n   - If `ar` is not asserted ('0'), the D flip-flop operates normally, capturing the input `d` on the rising edge of `clk`.\n\n3. **Initial Condition**: \n   - On power-up, or when the module is instantiated, the initial state of `q` is undefined until the first reset or clock edge event occurs.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- Bit Indexing: Not applicable as all signals are one bit.\n- There are no additional timing constraints or dependencies beyond those stated.\n- Ensure that the design accounts for any potential glitches on the `ar` line that could cause unintended resets.\n                    "
