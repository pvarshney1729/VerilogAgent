Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: 
  - `clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset (1-bit).
  - `in`: Serial data input (1-bit).

- Output:
  - `done`: Indicates successful byte reception (1-bit).

Functional Description:
- This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify correctly received bytes in a serial bit stream conforming to a specific serial communication protocol.

- The protocol format consists of:
  - 1 start bit (logic '0').
  - 8 data bits, transmitted least significant bit (LSB) first.
  - 1 stop bit (logic '1').

- The line is idle at logic '1' when no data is being transmitted.

- FSM Behavior:
  - Detect the start bit ('0') to begin byte reception.
  - Sequentially receive the 8 data bits following the start bit.
  - Verify the presence of a stop bit ('1') after the data bits.
  - If the stop bit is not detected as expected, the FSM must continue monitoring the input until a valid stop bit is detected before attempting to process the next byte.
  
- The `done` output signals high for one clock cycle when a byte is successfully received and validated (i.e., correct start, data, and stop bits).

- Reset Behavior:
  - On the assertion of `reset`, the FSM returns to its initial state, waiting for a start bit.
  - All internal state registers should be initialized to their default states upon reset.

- Indexing Convention:
  - Data bits are indexed from 0 to 7, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.

Edge Cases:
- The FSM should handle continuous '1's on the line by remaining in an idle state until a start bit is detected.
- Ensure no race conditions occur between detecting the stop bit and transitioning states.

Timing and Clock Cycle Relationships:
- All state transitions and outputs are updated on the rising edge of `clk`.
- The FSM logic should be designed to ensure stable and glitch-free transitions between states.
