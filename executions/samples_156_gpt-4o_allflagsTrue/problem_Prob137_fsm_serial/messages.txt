Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input: \n  - `clk`: Clock signal (1-bit). All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset (1-bit).\n  - `in`: Serial data input (1-bit).\n\n- Output:\n  - `done`: Indicates successful byte reception (1-bit).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) to identify correctly received bytes in a serial bit stream conforming to a specific serial communication protocol.\n\n- The protocol format consists of:\n  - 1 start bit (logic '0').\n  - 8 data bits, transmitted least significant bit (LSB) first.\n  - 1 stop bit (logic '1').\n\n- The line is idle at logic '1' when no data is being transmitted.\n\n- FSM Behavior:\n  - Detect the start bit ('0') to begin byte reception.\n  - Sequentially receive the 8 data bits following the start bit.\n  - Verify the presence of a stop bit ('1') after the data bits.\n  - If the stop bit is not detected as expected, the FSM must continue monitoring the input until a valid stop bit is detected before attempting to process the next byte.\n  \n- The `done` output signals high for one clock cycle when a byte is successfully received and validated (i.e., correct start, data, and stop bits).\n\n- Reset Behavior:\n  - On the assertion of `reset`, the FSM returns to its initial state, waiting for a start bit.\n  - All internal state registers should be initialized to their default states upon reset.\n\n- Indexing Convention:\n  - Data bits are indexed from 0 to 7, with bit[0] being the least significant bit.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The FSM should handle continuous '1's on the line by remaining in an idle state until a start bit is detected.\n- Ensure no race conditions occur between detecting the stop bit and transitioning states.\n\nTiming and Clock Cycle Relationships:\n- All state transitions and outputs are updated on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The FSM logic should be designed to ensure stable and glitch-free transitions between states.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the module `TopModule`, we need to design a finite state machine (FSM) that can detect and validate a byte in a serial communication protocol. The protocol consists of a start bit (0), 8 data bits (LSB first), and a stop bit (1). The FSM must transition through states to detect these bits in sequence and validate the byte.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define states for the FSM: `IDLE`, `START`, `DATA`, `STOP`, and `DONE`. The `IDLE` state waits for a start bit. The `START` state confirms the start bit. The `DATA` state reads 8 data bits. The `STOP` state verifies the stop bit. The `DONE` state indicates successful byte reception.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: The FSM transitions between states based on the input bit `in` and the current state.

The FSM consists of five states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP, and DONE. The IDLE state waits for a start bit (logic '0'). Upon detecting a start bit, the FSM transitions to the START state, then to the DATA state to count 8 data bits. A bit counter is used to track the number of data bits received. After receiving 8 data bits, the FSM transitions to the STOP state to verify the stop bit (logic '1'). If the stop bit is correct, the FSM transitions to the DONE state, setting the 'done' output high for one clock cycle, and then returns to the IDLE state. The FSM handles the synchronous reset by returning to the IDLE state and resetting the bit counter when the reset signal is asserted.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input  logic clk,\n    input  logic reset,\n    input  logic in,\n    output logic done\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        IDLE        = 3'b000,\n        START       = 3'b001,\n        DATA        = 3'b010,\n        STOP        = 3'b011,\n        DONE        = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [2:0] bit_counter; // Counter for 8 data bits\n\n    // Sequential logic for state transition\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= IDLE;\n            bit_counter <= 3'b000;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == DATA) begin\n                bit_counter <= bit_counter + 1;\n            end else begin\n                bit_counter <= 3'b000;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Combinational logic for next state and output\n    always_comb begin\n        done = 1'b0;\n        case (current_state)\n            IDLE: begin\n                if (in == 1'b0) // Detect start bit\n                    next_state = START;\n                else\n                    next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            START: begin\n                next_state = DATA;\n            end\n            DATA: begin\n                if (bit_counter == 3'b111) // 8 data bits received\n                    next_state = STOP;\n                else\n                    next_state = DATA;\n            end\n            STOP: begin\n                if (in == 1'b1) begin // Verify stop bit\n                    next_state = DONE;\n                end else begin\n                    next_state = STOP; // Wait for stop bit\n                end\n            end\n            DONE: begin\n                done = 1'b1;\n                next_state = IDLE;\n            end\n            default: next_state = IDLE;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"

The FSM will have the following states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP, and DONE. \n\n1. **IDLE State**: The FSM starts in the IDLE state, waiting for a start bit (logic '0'). If the input `in` is '0', it transitions to the START state.\n\n2. **START State**: This state is a transient state to confirm the start bit has been detected. It immediately transitions to the DATA state.\n\n3. **DATA State**: In this state, the FSM counts 8 data bits. A counter (`bit_counter`) is used to keep track of the number of bits received. Once 8 bits are received, it transitions to the STOP state.\n\n4. **STOP State**: The FSM checks for the stop bit (logic '1'). If the stop bit is detected, it transitions to the DONE state. If the stop bit is not detected, it remains in the STOP state until a '1' is detected.\n\n5. **DONE State**: This state indicates a successful byte reception. The `done` output is set high for one clock cycle, and the FSM transitions back to the IDLE state to wait for the next byte.\n\nThe FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize the state to IDLE and reset the bit counter. The `done` signal is set high only in the DONE state, indicating a successful byte reception.\n\nThe implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always_ff` for sequential logic, and `always_comb` for combinational logic.
