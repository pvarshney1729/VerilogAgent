Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `in`: A 3-bit input vector. The bits are indexed from 2 (Most Significant Bit) to 0 (Least Significant Bit), i.e., `in[2:0]`.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: A 2-bit output vector. The bits are indexed from 1 (Most Significant Bit) to 0 (Least Significant Bit), i.e., `out[1:0]`.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module implements a \"population count\" circuit. It counts the number of '1's present in the 3-bit input vector `in`.\n- The output `out` represents this count as a 2-bit binary number.\n\nOperational Details:\n- The module is purely combinational; there are no clock or reset signals associated with this design.\n- The population count operation is performed as follows:\n  - If `in` has 0 '1's, `out` will be `2'b00`.\n  - If `in` has 1 '1', `out` will be `2'b01`.\n  - If `in` has 2 '1's, `out` will be `2'b10`.\n  - If `in` has 3 '1's, `out` will be `2'b11`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- All possible input combinations (from `3'b000` to `3'b111`) are valid and accounted for, given the 3-bit width of the input vector.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- The calculation of the population count should ensure there are no race conditions as this is a purely combinational circuit.\n- The design must ensure the output `out` is updated immediately in response to any changes in the input `in`.\n                    "
