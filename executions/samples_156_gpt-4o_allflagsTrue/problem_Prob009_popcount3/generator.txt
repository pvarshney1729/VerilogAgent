<REASONING>
The task is to implement a module named `TopModule` that counts the number of '1's in a 3-bit input vector `in` and outputs the result as a 2-bit vector `out`. This is a combinational logic problem, so we can use an `assign` statement to directly compute the population count.

1. **Input and Output Declaration**: 
   - The input `in` is a 3-bit vector, and the output `out` is a 2-bit vector. We declare these using `logic` as per the coding conventions.

2. **Population Count Logic**:
   - The population count can be calculated by summing the individual bits of the input vector `in`. This is done using the expression `in[0] + in[1] + in[2]`.
   - The result of this sum will be a 2-bit number, which directly corresponds to the number of '1's in the input vector.

3. **Assign Statement**:
   - Since this is purely combinational logic, we use an `assign` statement to compute the value of `out` based on the input `in`.

4. **No Sequential Logic**:
   - There is no need for a clock or reset signal as this is a combinational circuit.

5. **Coding Conventions**:
   - We use `logic` for port declarations.
   - We use an `assign` statement for combinational logic, as there is no need for an `always` block.

This approach ensures that the module is simple, efficient, and adheres to the given guidelines and coding conventions.
