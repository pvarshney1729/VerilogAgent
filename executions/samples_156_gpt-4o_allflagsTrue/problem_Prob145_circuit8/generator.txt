<REASONING>
The task is to implement a sequential circuit based on the provided simulation waveforms. The circuit has two outputs, `p` and `q`, which are determined by the input `a` and the clock signal. The waveform suggests that `p` is set to `1` on the rising edge of the clock when `a` is `1`, and `q` follows `p` on the falling edge of the clock.

1. **Output `p` Logic**: 
   - `p` is updated on the rising edge of the clock.
   - If `a` is `1`, `p` is set to `1`.
   - If `a` is `0`, `p` is set to `0`.

2. **Output `q` Logic**:
   - `q` is updated on the falling edge of the clock.
   - `q` takes the value of `p` from the previous clock cycle.

The implementation uses two always blocks: one for the rising edge of the clock to update `p`, and another for the falling edge to update `q`. This ensures that `q` follows the state of `p` after the clock cycle completes.
