Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module named `TopModule` is to be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit wide:\n\n- `input clock`: The clock signal for the sequential circuit.\n- `input a`: A one-bit input signal.\n- `output p`: A one-bit output signal.\n- `output q`: A one-bit output signal.\n\n### Signal Conventions and Logic Descriptions:\n\n1. **Clock Signal (`clock`)**:\n   - This is the primary clock signal for the module.\n   - All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n\n2. **Input Signal (`a`)**:\n   - This is a one-bit input that affects the behavior of the output signals `p` and `q`.\n\n3. **Output Signals (`p` and `q`)**:\n   - These are one-bit outputs which are driven by the sequential logic of the circuit.\n\n### Circuit Behavior:\n\n- **Sequential Logic**:\n  - The circuit is sequential, utilizing flip-flops that are sensitive to the rising edge of the clock.\n  - The initial state of the outputs `p` and `q` should be considered as undefined (`x`) until the first rising edge of the clock.\n\n- **State Transitions**:\n  - On the rising edge of the clock:\n    - If `a` is `1`, `p` is set to `1`.\n    - If `a` is `0`, `p` is set to `0`.\n  - The `q` output is updated on the falling edge of the clock and follows the logic state of `p` from the previous clock cycle.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n\n- **Reset**:\n  - There is no explicit reset signal; initial conditions should consider `p` and `q` as `x` until defined by the clock cycles.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n\n- **Undefined Conditions**:\n  - Prior to the first clock edge, both `p` and `q` should be considered in an undefined state (`x`).\n  - During any change in the input `a`, outputs should be evaluated only on the rising edge of the clock for `p` and the falling edge for `q`.\n\n### Timing Constraints:\n\n- **Timing of Signals**:\n  - Ensure that input `a` is stable at least one clock cycle before evaluating the output.\n  - Outputs must be stable before the subsequent clock edge following any change in the input condition.\n\nUse this refined specification to implement the `TopModule` in Verilog, ensuring that all sequential elements are correctly synchronized with the clock signal.\n                    "
