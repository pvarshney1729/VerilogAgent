<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named `TopModule` is to be implemented with the following interface. All input and output ports are one bit wide:

- `input clock`: The clock signal for the sequential circuit.
- `input a`: A one-bit input signal.
- `output p`: A one-bit output signal.
- `output q`: A one-bit output signal.

### Signal Conventions and Logic Descriptions:

1. **Clock Signal (`clock`)**:
   - This is the primary clock signal for the module.
   - All sequential logic within the module is triggered on the rising edge of this clock signal.

2. **Input Signal (`a`)**:
   - This is a one-bit input that affects the behavior of the output signals `p` and `q`.

3. **Output Signals (`p` and `q`)**:
   - These are one-bit outputs which are driven by the sequential logic of the circuit.

### Circuit Behavior:

- **Sequential Logic**:
  - The circuit is sequential, utilizing flip-flops that are sensitive to the rising edge of the clock.
  - The initial state of the outputs `p` and `q` should be considered as undefined (`x`) until the first rising edge of the clock.

- **State Transitions**:
  - On the rising edge of the clock:
    - If `a` is `1`, `p` is set to `1`.
    - If `a` is `0`, `p` is set to `0`.
  - The `q` output is updated on the falling edge of the clock and follows the logic state of `p` from the previous clock cycle.

### Initial Conditions:

- **Reset**:
  - There is no explicit reset signal; initial conditions should consider `p` and `q` as `x` until defined by the clock cycles.

### Edge Cases:

- **Undefined Conditions**:
  - Prior to the first clock edge, both `p` and `q` should be considered in an undefined state (`x`).
  - During any change in the input `a`, outputs should be evaluated only on the rising edge of the clock for `p` and the falling edge for `q`.

### Timing Constraints:

- **Timing of Signals**:
  - Ensure that input `a` is stable at least one clock cycle before evaluating the output.
  - Outputs must be stable before the subsequent clock edge following any change in the input condition.

Use this refined specification to implement the `TopModule` in Verilog, ensuring that all sequential elements are correctly synchronized with the clock signal.
