Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input wire clk`: Clock signal, triggers on the rising edge.
- `input wire areset`: Asynchronous active-high reset signal.
- `input wire x`: 1-bit input signal.
- `output reg z`: 1-bit output signal.

Finite-State Machine (FSM) Description:
The FSM is a Mealy-type machine utilizing one-hot encoding to implement a 2's complementer. The module resets to state A upon receiving an active-high signal on `areset`.

State Encoding:
- State A: 2'b01
- State B: 2'b10

State Transition and Output Logic:
1. **State A:**
   - Transition: Remains in state A if `x` is 0.
   - Output: `z` = 0.
   - Transition: Moves to state B if `x` is 1.
   - Output: `z` = 1.

2. **State B:**
   - Transition: Remains in state B if `x` is 0.
   - Output: `z` = 1.
   - Transition: Remains in state B if `x` is 1.
   - Output: `z` = 0.

Clock and Reset Behavior:
- The FSM transitions and output logic are evaluated at the rising edge of `clk`.
- The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active-high, immediately forcing the FSM into state A regardless of the clock.

Initial Conditions:
- Upon reset, the FSM is in state A, and the output `z` is initialized accordingly based on the input `x`.

Signal Conventions:
- Bit indexing: Single bit signals; no indexing required.
- All signals are treated as unsigned.

Edge Cases:
- Ensure that transitions between states are glitch-free and comply with the one-hot encoding scheme.
- The FSM should handle continuous high `areset` signals gracefully by remaining in state A.
