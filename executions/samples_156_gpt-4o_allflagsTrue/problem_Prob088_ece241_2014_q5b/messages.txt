The module resets to state A upon receiving an active-high signal on `areset`.\n\nState Encoding:\n- State A: 2'b01\n- State B: 2'b10\n\nState Transition and Output Logic:\n1. **State A:**\n   - Transition: Remains in state A if `x` is 0.\n   - Output: `z` = 0.\n   - Transition: Moves to state B if `x` is 1.\n   - Output: `z` = 1.\n\n2. **State B:**\n   - Transition: Remains in state B if `x` is 0.\n   - Output: `z` = 1.\n   - Transition: Remains in state B if `x` is 1.\n   - Output: `z` = 0.\n\nClock and Reset Behavior:\n- The FSM transitions and output logic are evaluated at the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous and active-high, immediately forcing the FSM into state A regardless of the clock.\n\nInitial Conditions:\n- Upon reset, the FSM is in state A, and the output `z` is initialized accordingly based on the input `x`.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- Bit indexing: Single bit signals; no indexing required.\n- All signals are treated as unsigned.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Ensure that transitions between states are glitch-free and comply with the one-hot encoding scheme.\n- The FSM should handle continuous high `areset` signals gracefully by remaining in state A.\n                    "
