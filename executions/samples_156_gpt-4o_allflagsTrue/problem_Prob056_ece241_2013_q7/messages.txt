Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - clk: 1-bit input, used as the clock signal. The JK flip-flop operation occurs on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n  - j: 1-bit input, represents the J input for the JK flip-flop.\n  - k: 1-bit input, represents the K input for the JK flip-flop.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - Q: 1-bit output, represents the current state of the JK flip-flop. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a JK flip-flop with the following characteristic table:\n  - When J = 0 and K = 0, Q (the output) retains its previous value (Qold).\n  - When J = 0 and K = 1, Q is reset to 0.\n  - When J = 1 and K = 0, Q is set to 1.\n  - When J = 1 and K = 1, Q toggles its previous value (i.e., Q becomes ~Qold).\n\n- This is a sequential logic element, and all state transitions occur on the positive (rising) edge of the clock signal (clk).\n\nReset Behavior:\n- There is no explicit reset signal described in the original specification. The initial state of Q after power-up is assumed to be indeterminate unless otherwise specified in the implementation context.\n\nAdditional Clarifications:\n- Ensure that the implementation correctly handles potential race conditions by ensuring that all input signals are stable before the rising edge of the clock.\n- The implementation should assume that the inputs J and K are stable during the rising edge of the clock to avoid meta-stability issues.\n- The behavior is undefined for any conditions outside the specified truth table, such as simultaneous changes on J and K at the clock edge.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should handle normal clock signal behavior and ensure that Q is only updated on the positive edge as specified.\n- The flip-flop should correctly handle repeated clock cycles with the same J and K inputs according to the truth table.\n                    "

The flip-flop should update its state on the rising edge of the clock signal. \n\n1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with the specified inputs and output. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.\n\n2. **Sequential Logic**: We use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). This block will handle the state transitions of the JK flip-flop.\n\n3. **State Transition Logic**: Inside the `always` block, we use a `case` statement to implement the truth table:\n   - `2'b00`: The output `Q` retains its previous value (`Qold`).\n   - `2'b01`: The output `Q` is reset to `0`.\n   - `2'b10`: The output `Q` is set to `1`.\n   - `2'b11`: The output `Q` toggles its current value (`~Qold`).\n\n4. **Initialization**: Although not explicitly required by the specification, initializing `Q` to a known state can be beneficial in simulation. However, since no initial value is specified, we assume `Q` starts in an indeterminate state.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the provided coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using a `case` statement for clarity, and ensuring the `always` block is triggered by the clock edge without additional sensitivity list entries.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specified behavior and adheres to the provided guidelines and conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic j,\n    input logic k,\n    output logic Q\n);\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        case ({j, k})\n            2'b00: Q <= Q;       // No change\n            2'b01: Q <= 1'b0;    // Reset\n            2'b10: Q <= 1'b1;    // Set\n            2'b11: Q <= ~Q;      // Toggle\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
