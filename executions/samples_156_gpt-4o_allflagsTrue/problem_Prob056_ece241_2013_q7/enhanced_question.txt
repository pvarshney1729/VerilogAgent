Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - clk: 1-bit input, used as the clock signal. The JK flip-flop operation occurs on the rising edge of this clock signal.
  - j: 1-bit input, represents the J input for the JK flip-flop.
  - k: 1-bit input, represents the K input for the JK flip-flop.

- Output Ports:
  - Q: 1-bit output, represents the current state of the JK flip-flop. Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a JK flip-flop with the following characteristic table:
  - When J = 0 and K = 0, Q (the output) retains its previous value (Qold).
  - When J = 0 and K = 1, Q is reset to 0.
  - When J = 1 and K = 0, Q is set to 1.
  - When J = 1 and K = 1, Q toggles its previous value (i.e., Q becomes ~Qold).

- This is a sequential logic element, and all state transitions occur on the positive (rising) edge of the clock signal (clk).

Reset Behavior:
- There is no explicit reset signal described in the original specification. The initial state of Q after power-up is assumed to be indeterminate unless otherwise specified in the implementation context.

Additional Clarifications:
- Ensure that the implementation correctly handles potential race conditions by ensuring that all input signals are stable before the rising edge of the clock.
- The implementation should assume that the inputs J and K are stable during the rising edge of the clock to avoid meta-stability issues.
- The behavior is undefined for any conditions outside the specified truth table, such as simultaneous changes on J and K at the clock edge.

Edge Cases:
- The module should handle normal clock signal behavior and ensure that Q is only updated on the positive edge as specified.
- The flip-flop should correctly handle repeated clock cycles with the same J and K inputs according to the truth table.
