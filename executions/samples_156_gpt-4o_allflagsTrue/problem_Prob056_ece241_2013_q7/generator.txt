<REASONING>
To implement the JK flip-flop as specified, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with a clock input (`clk`), two control inputs (`j` and `k`), and an output (`Q`). The behavior of the flip-flop is defined by the truth table provided. The flip-flop should update its state on the rising edge of the clock signal. 

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with the specified inputs and output. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Sequential Logic**: We use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). This block will handle the state transitions of the JK flip-flop.

3. **State Transition Logic**: Inside the `always` block, we use a `case` statement to implement the truth table:
   - `2'b00`: The output `Q` retains its previous value (`Qold`).
   - `2'b01`: The output `Q` is reset to `0`.
   - `2'b10`: The output `Q` is set to `1`.
   - `2'b11`: The output `Q` toggles its current value (`~Qold`).

4. **Initialization**: Although not explicitly required by the specification, initializing `Q` to a known state can be beneficial in simulation. However, since no initial value is specified, we assume `Q` starts in an indeterminate state.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the provided coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using a `case` statement for clarity, and ensuring the `always` block is triggered by the clock edge without additional sensitivity list entries.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specified behavior and adheres to the provided guidelines and conventions.
