Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nThis module is designed to function as a single stage within an n-bit shift register circuit. Below is the refined specification for the module interface and behavior:\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: A single-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of this clock.\n  - `input w`: A single-bit data input from the previous stage of the shift register.\n  - `input R`: A single-bit data input representing the value to be loaded into the register when loading is enabled.\n  - `input E`: A single-bit enable signal for shifting. When high, the shift operation is enabled.\n  - `input L`: A single-bit load signal. When asserted high, the module loads the value from R into the register.\n  \n- Output Port:\n  - `output Q`: A single-bit output representing the current state of the register, which is the data passed to the next stage in the shift register.\n\nBehavior:\n1. The register within this module is a D flip-flop, storing a single bit of data.\n2. The flip-flop is triggered by the positive edge of the `clk` signal, making it synchronous.\n3. The register supports two operations:\n   - **Load Operation**: When `L` is high, the value on `R` is loaded into the output `Q` on the next positive clock edge.\n   - **Shift Operation**: When `L` is low and `E` is high, the value on `w` is shifted into the register on the next positive clock edge, updating `Q`.\n4. If both `L` and `E` are low, the output `Q` retains its previous state.\n5. At each clock cycle, the precedence of operations is such that the load operation takes priority over the shift operation.\n6. The module does not have an explicit reset; thus, the initial power-up state of `Q` is undefined unless specified by the surrounding system.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If both `L` and `E` are asserted simultaneously, the load operation (`L`) takes precedence, and `Q` will be set to the value of `R`.\n\nNote: The module assumes that the inputs `L`, `E`, `R`, and `w` are stable before the clock edge to avoid race conditions.\n                    "
