<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a single-bit register that can either load a value or shift a value based on control signals. The module has a clock input `clk` that triggers the sequential logic on its positive edge. The control signals are `L` for load and `E` for enable shift. The data inputs are `R` for the load value and `w` for the shift input. The output `Q` holds the current state of the register.

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module with the specified input and output ports. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Sequential Logic**: We use an `always @(posedge clk)` block to ensure that the logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. This block will handle the loading and shifting operations.

3. **Load Operation**: If the load signal `L` is asserted (high), the register should load the value from `R` into `Q`. This operation takes precedence over the shift operation.

4. **Shift Operation**: If the load signal `L` is not asserted and the enable shift signal `E` is asserted, the register should shift the value from `w` into `Q`.

5. **Output Retention**: If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the output `Q` retains its previous state.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module behaves as a single stage in a shift register, with the ability to load or shift data based on the control signals.
