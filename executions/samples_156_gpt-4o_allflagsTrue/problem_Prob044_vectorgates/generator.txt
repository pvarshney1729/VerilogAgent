<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specifications and guidelines. The module has two 3-bit inputs, `a` and `b`, and three outputs: `out_or_bitwise`, `out_or_logical`, and `out_not`.

1. **Bitwise OR Operation**: The `out_or_bitwise` output is computed using the bitwise OR operation on the inputs `a` and `b`. This is done using the `|` operator, which performs a bitwise OR on each corresponding bit of the two input vectors.

2. **Logical OR Operation**: The `out_or_logical` output is computed using the logical OR operation on the inputs `a` and `b`. The `|` operator is used to perform a bitwise OR on `a` and `b`, and the result is then reduced using the reduction OR operator `|` to produce a single bit result. This result is `1` if any bit in the result of `a | b` is `1`, otherwise it is `0`.

3. **Bitwise NOT Operation**: The `out_not` output is a 6-bit vector where the upper 3 bits (bits [5:3]) are the bitwise NOT of `b`, and the lower 3 bits (bits [2:0]) are the bitwise NOT of `a`. This is achieved by concatenating the bitwise NOT of `b` and `a` using the `{}` concatenation operator.

The implementation uses `assign` statements for combinational logic, adhering to the guideline of using continuous assignments for combinational logic instead of `always` blocks. The use of `assign` ensures that the outputs are updated immediately when the inputs change, which is suitable for this purely combinational logic module.
