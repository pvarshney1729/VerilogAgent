All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk\n - input  x\n - input  y (3 bits)\n - output Y0\n - output z\n\nThe module should implement the output logic and next state logic for an\nFSM using the table shown below. Note that the output Y0 is Y[0] of the\nnext state signal.\n\n   Present state input y[2:0] | Next state Y[2:0] when x=0, Next state Y[2:0] when x=1 | Output z\n   000 | 000, 001 | 0\n   001 | 001, 100 | 0\n   010 | 010, 001 | 0\n   011 | 001, 010 | 1\n   100 | 011, 100 | 1\n\n\n            </ORIGINAL_SPEC>\n\n            Please provide an improved version of the code that addresses these issues and correctly implements the specification!\n            \n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.s\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the FSM as specified, we need to handle both the state transitions and the output logic. The FSM transitions are based on the current state `y` and input `x`, and the output `z` is determined by the current state.\n\n1. **State Transition Logic**: We use a `case` statement to determine the next state based on the current state `y` and input `x`. This logic is placed inside an `always @(posedge clk)` block to ensure that state transitions occur synchronously with the clock.\n\n2. **Output Logic**: The output `Y0` is derived from the least significant bit of the next state, `next_state[0]`. The output `z` is determined by the current state `y`, using another `case` statement inside an `always @(*)` block for combinational logic.\n\n3. **Default Cases**: We include default cases in both `case` statements to handle unexpected states, ensuring the FSM returns to a known state (`000`) and sets `z` to `0` for safety.\n\n4. **Coding Conventions**: We declare all ports and signals as `logic`, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensure numeric constants have a size greater than zero.\n\n5. **Synchronous Reset**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the problem, a synchronous reset can be added if needed. However, the current implementation assumes no reset is required.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the FSM behaves as specified and adheres to the given coding conventions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic x,\n    input logic [2:0] y,\n    output logic Y0,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    logic [2:0] next_state;\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        case (y)\n            3'b000: next_state <= (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b000 : 3'b001;\n            3'b001: next_state <= (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b100;\n            3'b010: next_state <= (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b010 : 3'b001;\n            3'b011: next_state <= (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b001 : 3'b010;\n            3'b100: next_state <= (x == 1'b0) ? 3'b011 : 3'b100;\n            default: next_state <= 3'b000; // Default case for safety\n        endcase\n    end\n\n    always @(*) begin\n        Y0 = next_state[0];\n        case (y)\n            3'b011, 3'b100: z = 1'b1;\n            default: z = 1'b0;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
