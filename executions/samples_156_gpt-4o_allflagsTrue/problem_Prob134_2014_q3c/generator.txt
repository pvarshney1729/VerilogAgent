<REASONING>
To implement the FSM as specified, we need to handle both the state transitions and the output logic. The FSM transitions are based on the current state `y` and input `x`, and the output `z` is determined by the current state.

1. **State Transition Logic**: We use a `case` statement to determine the next state based on the current state `y` and input `x`. This logic is placed inside an `always @(posedge clk)` block to ensure that state transitions occur synchronously with the clock.

2. **Output Logic**: The output `Y0` is derived from the least significant bit of the next state, `next_state[0]`. The output `z` is determined by the current state `y`, using another `case` statement inside an `always @(*)` block for combinational logic.

3. **Default Cases**: We include default cases in both `case` statements to handle unexpected states, ensuring the FSM returns to a known state (`000`) and sets `z` to `0` for safety.

4. **Coding Conventions**: We declare all ports and signals as `logic`, use `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensure numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

5. **Synchronous Reset**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the problem, a synchronous reset can be added if needed. However, the current implementation assumes no reset is required.

By following these steps, we ensure that the FSM behaves as specified and adheres to the given coding conventions.
