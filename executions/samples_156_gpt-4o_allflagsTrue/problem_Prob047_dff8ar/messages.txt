Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal. The module operates on the rising edge of this signal.\n- `input wire areset`: Active-high asynchronous reset signal.\n- `input wire [7:0] d`: 8-bit data input. `d[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB), and `d[7]` refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n- `output reg [7:0] q`: 8-bit data output. `q[0]` is the LSB, and `q[7]` is the MSB.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module consists of 8 D flip-flops.\n- Each flip-flop captures the corresponding bit of the input `d` on the rising edge of the `clk`.\n- The flip-flops have an active-high asynchronous reset (`areset`), which, when asserted, sets the output `q` to 8'h00 (all bits zero).\n- The reset operation takes precedence over the clock operation. When `areset` is high, the output `q` is immediately reset to all zeros regardless of the clock state.\n\nInitialization and Edge Cases:\n- Upon power-up or initialization, the output `q` should be assumed to be in an undefined state until either the asynchronous reset is asserted or a clock edge occurs with a valid input.\n- The module does not specify behavior for metastability or undefined input conditions beyond ensuring reset precedence.\n\nNote:\n- Ensure all timing constraints related to the setup and hold times for the D flip-flops relative to `clk` are met to prevent race conditions or erroneous behavior.\n                    "
