<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to create a module with the specified interface: inputs `clk`, `areset`, and `d` (8 bits), and output `q` (8 bits). The module should use 8 D flip-flops with an active high asynchronous reset. The reset should set the output `q` to zero, and the flip-flops should be triggered by the positive edge of `clk`.

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with the specified ports. We use `logic` for all ports to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The asynchronous reset (`areset`) is included in the sensitivity list of the `always` block to ensure that when `areset` is high, the output `q` is immediately reset to zero, regardless of the clock state.

3. **D Flip-Flops**: The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk` or `areset`. If `areset` is high, `q` is set to `8'b00000000`. Otherwise, on the rising edge of `clk`, `q` is updated with the value of `d`.

4. **Coding Conventions**: We use `logic` for all signals, and the asynchronous reset is correctly handled by including it in the sensitivity list. The numeric constant for reset is sized (8 bits) as per the conventions.

5. **Simulation Initialization**: Although not explicitly required in the code, it is assumed that in simulation, all signals are initialized to zero unless specified otherwise.

This approach ensures that the module meets the specification requirements and adheres to the given guidelines and coding conventions.
