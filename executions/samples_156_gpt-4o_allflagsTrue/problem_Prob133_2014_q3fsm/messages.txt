Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Definitions:\n- input clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n- input reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal. The reset initializes the FSM to state A. \n- input s: Control signal used to transition from state A to state B.\n- input w: Signal observed in state B to determine the output z.\n- output z: Output signal set based on the FSM's evaluation of input w.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- Initial State: The FSM begins in state A upon reset. This state is maintained as long as s = 0.\n- State Transition from A: The FSM transitions from state A to state B when s = 1.\n- State B Operation: In state B, the FSM evaluates the input w over the next three consecutive clock cycles. \n  - If w = 1 occurs exactly two times within these three cycles, set output z to 1 in the cycle immediately following these three cycles.\n  - If w = 1 occurs less than or more than two times, set output z to 0 in the cycle immediately following these three cycles.\n- Cycle Continuation: After setting z, the FSM continues to monitor w in sets of three cycles while in state B.\n\nSequential Logic and Reset:\n- The reset signal is synchronous and active high. On reset, the FSM returns to state A.\n- All registers and flip-flops are initialized to zero unless otherwise specified.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- All ports are 1-bit wide. Bit[0] represents the least significant bit.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- The FSM effectively handles boundary conditions by resetting the count of w observations every three cycles in state B.\n- The input s is only checked in state A, and any changes to s while in state B do not affect the FSM until it returns to state A.\n\nNo race conditions are anticipated due to the synchronous nature of the FSM and the clear separation of state transitions and logic evaluations based on clock cycles.\n                    "

If true, `z` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. The FSM then resets the `w_count` and transitions back to STATE_B1 to continue the process.\n\n3. **Synchronous Reset**: The FSM uses a synchronous reset to initialize the state to STATE_A and reset the `w_count` and `z` to 0.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined in STATE_C based on the count of `w` being 1 in the previous three cycles.\n\n5. **Combinational Logic**: The next state logic is implemented using an always block with a case statement to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs.\n\n6. **Sequential Logic**: The state transitions and output logic are handled in an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring synchronous operation.\n\nThis design efficiently uses states to track the input `w` over three cycles and determine the output `z` based on the specified conditions.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic s,\n    input logic w,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_A  = 3'b000,\n        STATE_B1 = 3'b001,\n        STATE_B2 = 3'b010,\n        STATE_B3 = 3'b011,\n        STATE_C  = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t current_state, next_state;\n    logic [1:0] w_count;\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            current_state <= STATE_A;\n            w_count <= 2'b00;\n            z <= 1'b0;\n        end else begin\n            current_state <= next_state;\n            if (current_state == STATE_B1 || current_state == STATE_B2 || current_state == STATE_B3) begin\n                if (w) w_count <= w_count + 1;\n            end\n            if (current_state == STATE_C) begin\n                if (w_count == 2'b10) z <= 1'b1;\n                else z <= 1'b0;\n                w_count <= 2'b00; // Reset count for next cycle\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (current_state)\n            STATE_A: begin\n                if (s) next_state = STATE_B1;\n                else next_state = STATE_A;\n            end\n            STATE_B1: next_state = STATE_B2;\n            STATE_B2: next_state = STATE_B3;\n            STATE_B3: next_state = STATE_C;\n            STATE_C: next_state = STATE_B1;\n            default: next_state = STATE_A;\n        endcase\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n```"
