Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- input clk: Clock signal for synchronous operations. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
- input reset: Active-high synchronous reset signal. The reset initializes the FSM to state A. 
- input s: Control signal used to transition from state A to state B.
- input w: Signal observed in state B to determine the output z.
- output z: Output signal set based on the FSM's evaluation of input w.

State Machine Description:
- Initial State: The FSM begins in state A upon reset. This state is maintained as long as s = 0.
- State Transition from A: The FSM transitions from state A to state B when s = 1.
- State B Operation: In state B, the FSM evaluates the input w over the next three consecutive clock cycles. 
  - If w = 1 occurs exactly two times within these three cycles, set output z to 1 in the cycle immediately following these three cycles.
  - If w = 1 occurs less than or more than two times, set output z to 0 in the cycle immediately following these three cycles.
- Cycle Continuation: After setting z, the FSM continues to monitor w in sets of three cycles while in state B.

Sequential Logic and Reset:
- The reset signal is synchronous and active high. On reset, the FSM returns to state A.
- All registers and flip-flops are initialized to zero unless otherwise specified.

Bit Indexing:
- All ports are 1-bit wide. Bit[0] represents the least significant bit.

Edge Case Handling:
- The FSM effectively handles boundary conditions by resetting the count of w observations every three cycles in state B.
- The input s is only checked in state A, and any changes to s while in state B do not affect the FSM until it returns to state A.

No race conditions are anticipated due to the synchronous nature of the FSM and the clear separation of state transitions and logic evaluations based on clock cycles.
