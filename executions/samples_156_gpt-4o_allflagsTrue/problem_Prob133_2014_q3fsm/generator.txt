<REASONING>
To implement the FSM as specified, we need to define a state machine with the following states:
- **STATE_A**: The initial state where the FSM waits for the input `s` to become 1. The FSM remains in this state as long as `s` is 0.
- **STATE_B1, STATE_B2, STATE_B3**: These states are used to count the number of times `w` is 1 over three clock cycles. The FSM transitions through these states sequentially.
- **STATE_C**: This state is used to evaluate the count of `w` and set the output `z` accordingly. If `w` was 1 exactly twice during the three cycles, `z` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.

The FSM transitions are as follows:
- From **STATE_A** to **STATE_B1** when `s` is 1.
- From **STATE_B1** to **STATE_B2**, **STATE_B2** to **STATE_B3**, and **STATE_B3** to **STATE_C** sequentially.
- From **STATE_C** back to **STATE_B1** to continue the cycle of checking `w`.

The synchronous reset ensures that the FSM returns to **STATE_A** when the reset signal is high. The `w_count` is used to track the number of times `w` is 1 during the three cycles in states **STATE_B1**, **STATE_B2**, and **STATE_B3**. The output `z` is set based on the value of `w_count` in **STATE_C**.

The code adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring the reset is synchronous.
