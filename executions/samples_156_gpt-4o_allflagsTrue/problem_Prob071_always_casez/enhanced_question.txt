<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module, named `TopModule`, shall be implemented with the following interface specifications. Unless otherwise specified, all input and output ports are one bit.

- Input Ports:
  - `in` (8 bits): This input vector is named `in` and is an 8-bit wide bus. The index bit[0] represents the least significant bit (LSB), and bit[7] represents the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Ports:
  - `pos` (3 bits): This output is a 3-bit wide bus that indicates the position of the first high bit in the input vector `in`, starting from the least significant bit.

Functional Description:
- The module shall function as a priority encoder for the 8-bit input `in`.
- The `pos` output will report the zero-based index of the first bit set to '1' in the input vector `in`. The search for a bit set to '1' should begin at bit[0] and proceed towards bit[7].
- If no bits in the input vector `in` are set to '1', the output `pos` shall be 3'd0.

Example:
- For an input `in` of 8'b10010000, the output `pos` should be 3'd4, as bit[4] is the first bit set to '1'.

Edge Cases:
- If the input vector `in` is 8'b00000000, the output `pos` must be 3'd0, indicating no bits are high.

Additional Notes:
- This module implements combinational logic; there are no clocked or sequential elements required.
- No reset signals are needed since the module does not contain any state or memory elements.
- Ensure that the output `pos` is always valid and stable with respect to the input `in`.
