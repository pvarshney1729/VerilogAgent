<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule`, we need to detect positive edges on each bit of an 8-bit input vector `in`. A positive edge is defined as a transition from 0 to 1. The output `pedge` should reflect these transitions in the next clock cycle.

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with inputs `clk` and `in`, and output `pedge`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Previous State Register**: We declare a register `prev_in` to store the previous state of the input vector `in`. This is necessary to detect transitions from 0 to 1.

3. **Sequential Logic**: We use an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to implement the sequential logic. Inside this block:
   - We calculate the positive edge detection using the expression `~prev_in & in`. This expression sets a bit in `pedge` if the corresponding bit in `in` transitions from 0 to 1.
   - We update `prev_in` with the current state of `in` to be used in the next clock cycle.

4. **Output Assignment**: The result of the bitwise operation is assigned to `pedge`, ensuring that the output reflects the positive edge detection in the next clock cycle.

This approach ensures that the module correctly detects positive edges on each bit of the input vector and updates the output accordingly.
