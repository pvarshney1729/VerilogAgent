Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input signal.\n  - `in`: 8-bit unsigned input vector, where `in[0]` represents the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` represents the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `pedge`: 8-bit unsigned output vector, where `pedge[0]` represents the LSB and `pedge[7]` represents the MSB.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module detects a positive edge on each bit of the input vector `in`.\n- A positive edge is defined as a transition from logic level 0 to logic level 1 on a given bit between consecutive clock cycles.\n- For each bit `in[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 7), the corresponding output bit `pedge[i]` should be set to 1 during the clock cycle immediately after a 0 to 1 transition on `in[i]` is detected.\n- If no 0 to 1 transition occurs, `pedge[i]` should remain at 0.\n\nClocking and Reset:\n- The design is synchronous, operating on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- All flip-flops and sequential elements must be initialized to 0 at power-up or reset.\n- A reset mechanism is not explicitly described; it is assumed that the initial condition of all registers is reset to 0 on power-up.\n\nEdge Case Considerations:\n- The behavior of the circuit at power-up should begin with all `pedge` bits at 0.\n- If input `in` holds a constant value (all bits are static), the corresponding `pedge` output will remain 0.\n\nDependencies and Precedence:\n- The detection of the 0 to 1 transition and the setting of the `pedge` output occur in the same cycle following the detected transition.\n- Ensure no race conditions by basing decisions solely on the sampled input vector value at the rising edge of `clk`.\n\nNote: This specification assumes that all necessary initialization and operating conditions are met, and it does not involve asynchronous resets.\n                    "
