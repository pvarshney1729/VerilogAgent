Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- `input wire a`: Single-bit input.
- `input wire b`: Single-bit input.
- `input wire c`: Single-bit input.
- `input wire d`: Single-bit input.
- `output wire out`: Single-bit output.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All input and output ports are single-bit, thus bit indexing does not apply.

Logic Implementation:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit based on the provided Karnaugh map.

Karnaugh Map Definition:
- The Karnaugh map is defined with inputs `a` and `b` representing the column indices and inputs `c` and `d` representing the row indices.

Karnaugh Map Table:

             ab
  cd   00  01  11  10
  00 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  01 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

- Each entry in the table specifies the output `out` for the corresponding combination of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Operational Details:
- The module is purely combinational; there are no clock signals or sequential elements such as flip-flops or registers.
- Ensure that the logic is implemented to evaluate combinationally without any race conditions or hazards.

Edge Cases:
- As all inputs are single-bit, the Karnaugh map covers all possible input combinations, ensuring defined behavior for every possible input state.
