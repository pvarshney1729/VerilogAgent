Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operations. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active-high. Resets the state machine to the initial state.\n  - `input bump_left`: Signal indicating a bump on the left side. Active-high.\n  - `input bump_right`: Signal indicating a bump on the right side. Active-high.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output walk_left`: Indicates the critter is walking left. Active-high.\n  - `output walk_right`: Indicates the critter is walking right. Active-high.\n\nState Machine Specification:\n- The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with two states:\n  1. State LEFT: The critter is walking left (`walk_left = 1`, `walk_right = 0`).\n  2. State RIGHT: The critter is walking right (`walk_left = 0`, `walk_right = 1`).\n\n- Initial State: Upon assertion of `areset`, the FSM transitions to State LEFT, setting `walk_left = 1` and `walk_right = 0`.\n\n- State Transition Logic:\n  - From State LEFT:\n    - If `bump_left == 1`, transition to State RIGHT.\n    - If `bump_left == 0`, remain in State LEFT.\n  - From State RIGHT:\n    - If `bump_right == 1`, transition to State LEFT.\n    - If `bump_right == 0`, remain in State RIGHT.\n  - If both `bump_left` and `bump_right` are asserted simultaneously, switch direction.\n\n- Asynchronous Reset Behavior:\n  - The `areset` signal, when asserted, will immediately reset the FSM to State LEFT, regardless of the current state or clock edge.\n\n- Bit Indexing Convention:\n  - All signals are single-bit, where `1` represents the active or asserted state.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When both `bump_left` and `bump_right` are asserted, the FSM should switch directions. The precedence of state transition in this case is handled by simultaneous evaluation.\n\n- Ensure that the outputs are correctly updated based on the current state of the FSM to avoid race conditions.\n\n- The module does not account for any additional input conditions or undefined states beyond the specified behavior.\n                    "

The module uses a Moore state machine with two states: WALK_LEFT and WALK_RIGHT. The state transitions are determined by the bump_left and bump_right inputs, and the outputs walk_left and walk_right are determined by the current state.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: Two states are defined using an enumerated type (state_t) for clarity and readability. The states are WALK_LEFT and WALK_RIGHT.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An always_ff block is used for the state transition logic, triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the asynchronous reset (areset).

Otherwise, the state transitions to the next state based on the current state and inputs.\n\n3. **Next State Logic**: An always_comb block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the bump inputs. If in WALK_LEFT state and bump_left is asserted, the next state is WALK_RIGHT. If in WALK_RIGHT state and bump_right is asserted, the next state is WALK_LEFT.

In WALK_LEFT state, walk_left is set to 1 and walk_right to 0. In WALK_RIGHT state, walk_right is set to 1 and walk_left to 0.\n\n5. **Asynchronous Reset**: The areset signal is handled in the state transition logic to reset the state to WALK_LEFT when asserted.\n\nThe module adheres to the coding conventions by using logic for all signals, using always_ff for sequential logic, and always_comb for combinational logic.
