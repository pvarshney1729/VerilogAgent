Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operations. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `input areset`: Asynchronous reset signal, active-high. Resets the state machine to the initial state.
  - `input bump_left`: Signal indicating a bump on the left side. Active-high.
  - `input bump_right`: Signal indicating a bump on the right side. Active-high.

- Output Ports:
  - `output walk_left`: Indicates the critter is walking left. Active-high.
  - `output walk_right`: Indicates the critter is walking right. Active-high.

State Machine Specification:
- The module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with two states:
  1. State LEFT: The critter is walking left (`walk_left = 1`, `walk_right = 0`).
  2. State RIGHT: The critter is walking right (`walk_left = 0`, `walk_right = 1`).

- Initial State: Upon assertion of `areset`, the FSM transitions to State LEFT, setting `walk_left = 1` and `walk_right = 0`.

- State Transition Logic:
  - From State LEFT:
    - If `bump_left == 1`, transition to State RIGHT.
    - If `bump_left == 0`, remain in State LEFT.
  - From State RIGHT:
    - If `bump_right == 1`, transition to State LEFT.
    - If `bump_right == 0`, remain in State RIGHT.
  - If both `bump_left` and `bump_right` are asserted simultaneously, switch direction.

- Asynchronous Reset Behavior:
  - The `areset` signal, when asserted, will immediately reset the FSM to State LEFT, regardless of the current state or clock edge.

- Bit Indexing Convention:
  - All signals are single-bit, where `1` represents the active or asserted state.

Edge Cases:
- When both `bump_left` and `bump_right` are asserted, the FSM should switch directions. The precedence of state transition in this case is handled by simultaneous evaluation.

- Ensure that the outputs are correctly updated based on the current state of the FSM to avoid race conditions.

- The module does not account for any additional input conditions or undefined states beyond the specified behavior.
