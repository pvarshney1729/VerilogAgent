Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.
  - `input load`: Control signal to load initial state, active high, synchronous with the clock.
  - `input [255:0] data`: 256-bit input vector for loading initial state. Each bit represents a cell state (1 for alive, 0 for dead).

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [255:0] q`: 256-bit output vector representing the current 16x16 grid state. Each bit represents a cell state.

Grid Configuration:
- Grid Size: 16x16, represented as a 256-bit vector.
- Bit Indexing: 
  - `q[15:0]` represents row 0.
  - `q[31:16]` represents row 1, and so on up to `q[255:240]` for row 15.
  - Bit indexing follows MSB to LSB order; `q[0]` is the least significant bit.

Game Rules (Conway's Game of Life on a Toroidal Grid):
- Each cell has 8 neighbours (considering toroidal wrapping).
- State Transition Rules per Cell:
  1. 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0 (dead).
  2. 2 neighbours: Cell state remains unchanged.
  3. 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1 (alive).
  4. 4 or more neighbours: Cell becomes 0 (dead).

Operational Details:
- `load` Signal: 
  - When `load` is high, the `data` input is loaded into `q` on the next positive clock edge.
  - This operation is used to initialize the grid with a specific state.
  
- `q` Output:
  - Represents the current state of the 16x16 grid.
  - Updated every clock cycle based on the game rules, unless `load` is active.

- Clocking:
  - All sequential logic, including state updates and loading, is triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.
  
- Initial State:
  - When `load` is active, `q` is set to the value of `data` on the next clock edge.
  - If `load` is not active, the grid state is updated based on the current rules.

- Edge Case Handling:
  - The grid is treated as a toroid, meaning the edges wrap around, and each cell always has 8 neighbours.

- Reset: Not explicitly mentioned; assume no asynchronous reset is required unless further specified.

Timing:
- State updates occur every clock cycle, provided `load` is not active, ensuring the game progresses by one timestep per cycle.
