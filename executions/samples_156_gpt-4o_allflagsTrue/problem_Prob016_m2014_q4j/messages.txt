Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    <ENHANCED_SPEC>\nModule Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `x`: A 4-bit input vector representing the first operand. This input is unsigned and uses a 0-indexed bit order, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n  - `y`: A 4-bit input vector representing the second operand. This input is unsigned and uses a 0-indexed bit order, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output:\n  - `sum`: A 5-bit output vector representing the result of the addition operation. This includes a carry-out or overflow bit. The output is unsigned and uses a 0-indexed bit order, where bit[0] is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a 4-bit binary adder using a series of full adders. Each full adder takes two bits from the same position in `x` and `y` along with a carry-in from the previous less significant position, and it generates a sum bit and a carry-out.\n- The carry-out from the most significant full adder (bit[3]) is used as the overflow bit and is assigned to `sum[4]`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- If both `x` and `y` are at their maximum value (4'b1111), the resulting `sum` will be 5'b11110, indicating an overflow as expected.\n- The outputs are combinationally dependent on the inputs and change immediately as inputs `x` and `y` change.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- This module does not include any clock or reset signals, as it is purely combinational and does not involve any storage elements.\n- Ensure that the adder handles all possible input combinations correctly, including the handling of carry propagation across all bits.\n\n<ENHANCED_SPEC>\n                    "

Each full adder takes two input bits and a carry-in, producing a sum bit and a carry-out. The carry-out from each full adder becomes the carry-in for the next more significant bit. The final carry-out from the most significant bit is used as the overflow bit in the output `sum`.\n\n1. **Bit 0**: The least significant bit of `x` and `y` is added directly, as there is no carry-in.

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE] tags.\nDo NOT use Markdown code blocks (```) inside the [BEGIN]/[DONE] tags.\nYour code should look like:\n\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input in,\n    output out\n);\n    // Your implementation here\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>\n\nPLEASE USE XML TAGS provided to enclose your response!\n \n            "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nTo implement the 4-bit adder using full adders, we decompose the addition process into a series of bit-wise operations. Each bit position uses a full adder, which takes two input bits and a carry-in bit, and produces a sum bit and a carry-out bit. The carry-out from each bit position becomes the carry-in for the next higher bit position. The most significant carry-out becomes the overflow bit.\n\n1. **Bit 0 Addition**: \n   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR: `sum[0] = x[0] ^ y[0]`.\n   - Carry-out is calculated using AND: `c1 = x[0] & y[0]`.\n\n2. **Bit 1 Addition**:\n   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR with carry-in: `sum[1] = x[1] ^ y[1] ^ c1`.\n   - Carry-out is calculated using OR of ANDs: `c2 = (x[1] & y[1]) | (x[1] & c1) | (y[1] & c1)`.\n\n3. **Bit 2 Addition**:\n   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR with carry-in: `sum[2] = x[2] ^ y[2] ^ c2`.\n   - Carry-out is calculated using OR of ANDs: `c3 = (x[2] & y[2]) | (x[2] & c2) | (y[2] & c2)`.\n\n4. **Bit 3 Addition**:\n   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR with carry-in: `sum[3] = x[3] ^ y[3] ^ c3`.\n   - Carry-out is calculated using OR of ANDs: `c4 = (x[3] & y[3]) | (x[3] & c3) | (y[3] & c3)`.\n\n5. **Overflow Bit**:\n   - The overflow bit is the carry-out from the most significant bit: `sum[4] = c4`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the addition is performed correctly and the overflow is captured in the 5th bit of the output.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic [3:0] x,\n    input logic [3:0] y,\n    output logic [4:0] sum\n);\n\n    logic c1, c2, c3, c4; // Intermediate carry signals\n\n    // Full adder for bit 0\n    assign sum[0] = x[0] ^ y[0];\n    assign c1 = x[0] & y[0];\n\n    // Full adder for bit 1\n    assign sum[1] = x[1] ^ y[1] ^ c1;\n    assign c2 = (x[1] & y[1]) | (x[1] & c1) | (y[1] & c1);\n\n    // Full adder for bit 2\n    assign sum[2] = x[2] ^ y[2] ^ c2;\n    assign c3 = (x[2] & y[2]) | (x[2] & c2) | (y[2] & c2);\n\n    // Full adder for bit 3\n    assign sum[3] = x[3] ^ y[3] ^ c3;\n    assign c4 = (x[3] & y[3]) | (x[3] & c3) | (y[3] & c3);\n\n    // Overflow bit\n    assign sum[4] = c4;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
