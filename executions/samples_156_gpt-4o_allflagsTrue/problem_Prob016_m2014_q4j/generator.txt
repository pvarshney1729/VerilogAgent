<REASONING>
To implement the 4-bit adder using full adders, we decompose the addition process into a series of bit-wise operations. Each bit position uses a full adder, which takes two input bits and a carry-in bit, and produces a sum bit and a carry-out bit. The carry-out from each bit position becomes the carry-in for the next higher bit position. The most significant carry-out becomes the overflow bit.

1. **Bit 0 Addition**: 
   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR: `sum[0] = x[0] ^ y[0]`.
   - Carry-out is calculated using AND: `c1 = x[0] & y[0]`.

2. **Bit 1 Addition**:
   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR with carry-in: `sum[1] = x[1] ^ y[1] ^ c1`.
   - Carry-out is calculated using OR of ANDs: `c2 = (x[1] & y[1]) | (x[1] & c1) | (y[1] & c1)`.

3. **Bit 2 Addition**:
   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR with carry-in: `sum[2] = x[2] ^ y[2] ^ c2`.
   - Carry-out is calculated using OR of ANDs: `c3 = (x[2] & y[2]) | (x[2] & c2) | (y[2] & c2)`.

4. **Bit 3 Addition**:
   - Sum bit is calculated using XOR with carry-in: `sum[3] = x[3] ^ y[3] ^ c3`.
   - Carry-out is calculated using OR of ANDs: `c4 = (x[3] & y[3]) | (x[3] & c3) | (y[3] & c3)`.

5. **Overflow Bit**:
   - The overflow bit is the carry-out from the most significant bit: `sum[4] = c4`.

This approach ensures that the addition is performed correctly and the overflow is captured in the 5th bit of the output.
