Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module to be implemented is named `TopModule`. It interfaces with the following ports, where each port is 1-bit wide unless specified otherwise:\n\n- `input logic clk`: The clock signal, triggering all sequential logic on its positive edge.\n- `input logic reset`: A synchronous, active-high reset signal for the finite state machine (FSM).\n- `input logic x`: A control input signal.\n- `output logic z`: The output signal.\n\nThe FSM consists of states represented by a 3-bit vector `y[2:0]`, with `y[0]` as the least significant bit (LSB) and `y[2]` as the most significant bit (MSB). Upon activation of the reset signal, the FSM synchronously transitions to the initial state `000`.\n\nState transition logic is defined as follows:\n\n- **Present State `000`**: \n  - If `x = 0`, transition to next state `000`.\n  - If `x = 1`, transition to next state `001`.\n  - Output `z = 0`.\n\n- **Present State `001`**: \n  - If `x = 0`, transition to next state `001`.\n  - If `x = 1`, transition to next state `100`.\n  - Output `z = 0`.\n\n- **Present State `010`**: \n  - If `x = 0`, transition to next state `010`.\n  - If `x = 1`, transition to next state `001`.\n  - Output `z = 0`.\n\n- **Present State `011`**: \n  - If `x = 0`, transition to next state `001`.\n  - If `x = 1`, transition to next state `010`.\n  - Output `z = 1`.\n\n- **Present State `100`**: \n  - If `x = 0`, transition to next state `011`.\n  - If `x = 1`, transition to next state `100`.\n  - Output `z = 1`.\n\nThe reset state of all flip-flops or registers is explicitly defined as state `000`. Ensure all sequential elements start with this initial state upon reset activation. Handle all edge cases by strictly adhering to the defined state transitions and output behaviors as described.\n                    "

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specifications and guidelines. The module is designed to implement a finite-state machine (FSM) with a synchronous reset. The FSM transitions between states based on the input `x` and outputs `z` according to the provided state table.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using a 3-bit vector, and an enumerated type `state_t` is used for better readability and maintainability. Each state is assigned a unique 3-bit value.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: An `always @(*)` block is used to determine the next state based on the current state and input `x`. The case statement handles each state and assigns the appropriate next state according to the state table.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic with Synchronous Reset**: An `always @(posedge clk)` block is used to update the current state. If the `reset` signal is high, the FSM is reset to the initial state `STATE_000`. Otherwise, the FSM transitions to the `next_state`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: Another `always @(*)` block is used to determine the output `z` based on the current state. The output is set to `1` for states `STATE_011` and `STATE_100`, and `0` for all other states.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals, and `always @(*)` for combinational logic.

The FSM has five states, each represented by a 3-bit vector. The state transitions and output logic are defined by the given state table.\n\n1. **State Encoding**: We define an enumerated type `state_t` to represent the states using 3-bit vectors. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n2. **State Transition Logic**: We use a combinational `always @(*)` block to determine the next state based on the current state and input `x`. The state transitions are implemented using a `case` statement that matches the provided state table.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic with Synchronous Reset**: We use a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block to update the current state. The synchronous reset is implemented by checking the `reset` signal within this block. If `reset` is high, the state is set to `STATE_000`.\n\n4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is determined by the current state. We use another combinational `always @(*)` block with a `case` statement to set `z` according to the state table.\n\n5. **Coding Conventions**: We adhere to the provided coding conventions by using `logic` for all signals, employing `always @(*)` for combinational logic, and ensuring all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the FSM behaves as specified, with correct state transitions and output generation.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule (\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic reset,\n    input logic x,\n    output logic z\n);\n\n    // State encoding\n    typedef enum logic [2:0] {\n        STATE_000 = 3'b000,\n        STATE_001 = 3'b001,\n        STATE_010 = 3'b010,\n        STATE_011 = 3'b011,\n        STATE_100 = 3'b100\n    } state_t;\n\n    state_t state, next_state;\n\n    // State transition logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        case (state)\n            STATE_000: next_state = (x == 1'b0) ?
