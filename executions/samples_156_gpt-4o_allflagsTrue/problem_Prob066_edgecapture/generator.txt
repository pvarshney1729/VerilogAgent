<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specification and guidelines. The module is designed to detect a 1-to-0 transition for each bit in the 32-bit input vector `in` and set the corresponding bit in the output vector `out` to 1. The output will remain 1 until a synchronous reset is applied.

1. **Port Declaration**: The module has a clock (`clk`), a synchronous reset (`reset`), a 32-bit input vector (`in`), and a 32-bit output vector (`out`). All ports are declared using `logic` as per the coding conventions.

2. **Previous State Storage**: A register `prev_in` is used to store the previous state of the input vector `in`. This allows the module to detect transitions from 1 to 0.

3. **Synchronous Reset**: The reset logic is implemented inside the `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. When `reset` is high, both `out` and `prev_in` are set to zero.

4. **Transition Detection**: The logic `out <= out | (prev_in & ~in);` detects a 1-to-0 transition. It uses bitwise AND and NOT operations to identify bits that changed from 1 to 0. The result is ORed with the current value of `out` to ensure captured transitions are retained.

5. **Sequential Logic**: The `always` block is used for sequential logic, ensuring that changes are captured on the rising edge of the clock.

6. **Initialization**: The reset logic ensures that all registers are initialized to zero, aligning with the simulation requirements.

This implementation adheres to the provided interface, guidelines, and coding conventions, ensuring correct functionality and simulation behavior.
