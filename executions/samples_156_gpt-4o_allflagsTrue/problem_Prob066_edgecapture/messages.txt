All input and output ports are one bit wide unless otherwise specified.\n\n- `input logic clk;` // 1-bit clock input, triggering on the positive edge\n- `input logic reset;` // 1-bit active-high synchronous reset\n- `input logic [31:0] in;` // 32-bit input vector\n- `output logic [31:0] out;` // 32-bit output vector\n\n**Functional Description:**\n\n1. **Clock and Reset Behavior:**\n   - The module operates on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`).\n   - The reset (`reset`) is an active-high synchronous signal.\n   - When `reset` is asserted (high) on the rising edge of `clk`, all bits of the output vector `out` are reset to 0.\n\n2. **Signal Capture Logic:**\n   - The module monitors each bit of the 32-bit input vector `in`.\n   - For each bit `n` (where `n` ranges from 0 to 31, with `in[0]` being the least significant bit):\n     - If `in[n]` changes from 1 in the previous clock cycle to 0 in the current clock cycle, the corresponding bit `out[n]` is set to 1.\n     - Once `out[n]` is set to 1, it remains 1 until a reset occurs.\n\n3. **Edge Case and Boundary Behavior:**\n   - Initial state: After a reset, all bits of the output vector `out` are initialized to 0.\n   - The detection of a falling edge (1 to 0 transition) for each bit is independent of other bits.\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- Ensure that the module's logic correctly identifies and captures the 1-to-0 transitions for each bit independently.\n- The reset must effectively clear all captured states, setting `out` to a 32-bit vector of zeros.\n                    "
