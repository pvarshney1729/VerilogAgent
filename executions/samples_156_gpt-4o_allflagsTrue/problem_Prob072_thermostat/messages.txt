        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire mode      // Specifies the operational mode: 1 for heating, 0 for cooling\n  - input wire too_cold  // Indicates if the temperature is below the desired threshold (1 if true)\n  - input wire too_hot   // Indicates if the temperature is above the desired threshold (1 if true)\n  - input wire fan_on    // User request to turn on the fan (1 if requested)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output reg heater    // Controls the heater: 1 to turn on, 0 to turn off\n  - output reg aircon    // Controls the air conditioner: 1 to turn on, 0 to turn off\n  - output reg fan       // Controls the blower fan: 1 to turn on, 0 to turn off\n\nFunctional Description:\n1. The module operates as a thermostat controller with two modes: heating and cooling.\n   - Heating Mode (mode = 1):\n     - Activate the heater (heater = 1) when it is too cold (too_cold = 1).\n     - Do not activate the air conditioner (aircon = 0) in this mode.\n   - Cooling Mode (mode = 0):\n     - Activate the air conditioner (aircon = 1) when it is too hot (too_hot = 1).\n     - Do not activate the heater (heater = 0) in this mode.\n\n2. The fan operation is determined by the state of the heater or air conditioner:\n   - Turn on the fan (fan = 1) whenever either the heater or air conditioner is active.\n   - Additionally, the fan can be turned on independently based on user input (fan_on = 1), even if both the heater and air conditioner are off.\n\n3. Ensure that at any time, either the heater or air conditioner is active, the fan is also active to facilitate air circulation.\n\nInitial Conditions and Reset Behavior:\n- All output signals (heater, aircon, fan) should initialize to 0.\n- There is no explicit reset signal; assume the initial state is the power-on state.\n\nSignal Relationships:\n- The operation of the fan depends on the states of heater, aircon, and fan_on.\n- Ensure no conflicting states occur between heater and aircon to avoid simultaneous activation.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Ensure proper handling when all inputs are 0; outputs should remain at their default states unless user control (fan_on) dictates otherwise.\n- Handle transitions between modes and ensure outputs are updated accordingly with each change in input signals.\n                    "
