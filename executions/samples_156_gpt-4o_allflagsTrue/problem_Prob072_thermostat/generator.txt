<REASONING>
To implement the TopModule, we need to follow the given specifications and guidelines. The module has a simple combinational logic design, so we will use continuous assignments with the `assign` statement. The module will have three main tasks:
1. Determine the state of the heater based on the mode and too_cold signals.
2. Determine the state of the air conditioner based on the mode and too_hot signals.
3. Determine the state of the fan based on the heater, air conditioner, and fan_on signals.

We will use bitwise operations to implement the logic for each output. The heater should be on when the mode is heating (mode = 1) and it is too cold (too_cold = 1). The air conditioner should be on when the mode is cooling (mode = 0) and it is too hot (too_hot = 1). The fan should be on when either the heater or air conditioner is on, or when the user requests it (fan_on = 1).

The guidelines specify using `logic` for all ports and signals, and using `always @(*)` for combinational logic, but since we are using continuous assignments, we will not use `always` blocks. We will ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

    // Heater logic: On in heating mode when too cold
    assign heater = mode & too_cold;

    // Air conditioner logic: On in cooling mode when too hot
    assign aircon = ~mode & too_hot;

    // Fan logic: On when heater or aircon is on, or when fan_on is requested
    assign fan = heater | aircon | fan_on;
