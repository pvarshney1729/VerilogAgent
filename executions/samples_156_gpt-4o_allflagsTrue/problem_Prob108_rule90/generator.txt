<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification for a one-dimensional cellular automaton using Rule 90. The module has a clock input `clk`, a load signal `load`, a 512-bit wide input `data`, and a 512-bit wide output `q`. The logic is designed to update the state of the automaton on each positive edge of the clock.

1. **Initialization and Load Logic**: 
   - When the `load` signal is high, the state of the automaton (`q`) is directly loaded with the input `data`. This allows for initializing or resetting the automaton to a known state.

2. **Rule 90 Logic**:
   - When `load` is low, the automaton advances by one time step according to Rule 90. The next state of each cell is determined by the XOR of its two neighbors.
   - For the boundary cells, `q[0]` and `q[511]`, the neighbors outside the array (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are assumed to be zero.

3. **Sequential Logic**:
   - The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring that all updates to the state are synchronized with the clock.
   - The `q_next` register is used to compute the next state of the automaton before updating `q`, ensuring that all cells are updated simultaneously.

4. **Coding Conventions**:
   - The module uses `logic` for all signals, adhering to modern SystemVerilog conventions.
   - The `always` block does not explicitly specify a sensitivity list, as it is triggered by the clock edge.
   - The implementation avoids using `wire` or `reg`, and all numeric constants are properly sized.

This design ensures that the automaton behaves correctly according to the specified rules and interfaces.
