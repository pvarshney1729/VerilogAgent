        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire clk`: Clock signal for sequential logic, triggering on the positive edge.\n  - `input wire load`: Control signal indicating when to load new data into the system.\n  - `input wire [511:0] data`: 512-bit wide input representing the initial state of the cellular automaton.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [511:0] q`: 512-bit wide output representing the current state of the cellular automaton.\n\nBehavioral Specification:\n1. The module implements a one-dimensional cellular automaton following Rule 90.\n2. The automaton consists of 512 cells, each represented by a single bit in the `q` array, where `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `q[511]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nOperational Details:\n1. On the positive edge of the `clk`:\n   - If `load` is asserted (high), the current state of the system (`q`) is loaded with the value of `data[511:0]`.\n   - If `load` is not asserted (low), the automaton advances by one time step according to Rule 90.\n\n2. Rule 90 Description:\n   - For each cell `q[i]`, the next state is determined by the XOR of its two neighbors: \n     - Left Neighbor: `q[i-1]` (if `i == 0`, assume `q[-1]` as 0, off)\n     - Right Neighbor: `q[i+1]` (if `i == 511`, assume `q[512]` as 0, off)\n\n   - Next State Table:\n     - `Left | Center | Right | Center's next state`\n     - `1    | 1      | 1     | 0`\n     - `1    | 1      | 0     | 1`\n     - `1    | 0      | 1     | 0`\n     - `1    | 0      | 0     | 1`\n     - `0    | 1      | 1     | 1`\n     - `0    | 1      | 0     | 0`\n     - `0    | 0      | 1     | 1`\n     - `0    | 0      | 0     | 0`\n\n3. Edge Conditions:\n   - For `q[0]`, use `0` for the left boundary.\n   - For `q[511]`, use `0` for the right boundary.\n\n4. Reset Condition:\n   - No explicit reset condition is described; the module will rely on the `load` signal to initialize or update the state as needed.\n\nEnsure all sequential elements are synchronized with the positive edge of the `clk` signal and handle the `load` signal appropriately to update the state.\n                    "

All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  clk,\n - input  load,\n - input  data (512 bits)\n - output q    (512 bits)\n\nThe module should implement Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton\nwith interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a\none-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next\nstate of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:\n\n  Left | Center | Right | Center's next state\n  1    | 1      | 1     | 0\n  1    | 1      | 0     | 1\n  1    | 0      | 1     | 0\n  1    | 0      | 0     | 1\n  0    | 1      | 1     | 1\n  0    | 1      | 0     | 0\n  0    | 0      | 1     | 1\n  0    | 0      | 0     | 0\n\nIn this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one\ntime step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the\nsystem should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1]\nand q[512]) are both zero (off).

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the specification for a one-dimensional cellular automaton using Rule 90. The module has a clock input `clk`, a load signal `load`, a 512-bit wide input `data`, and a 512-bit wide output `q`. The logic is designed to update the state of the automaton on each positive edge of the clock.\n\n1. **Initialization and Load Logic**: \n   - When the `load` signal is high, the state of the automaton (`q`) is directly loaded with the input `data`. This allows for initializing or resetting the automaton to a known state.\n\n2. **Rule 90 Logic**:\n   - When `load` is low, the automaton advances by one time step according to Rule 90. The next state of each cell is determined by the XOR of its two neighbors.\n   - For the boundary cells, `q[0]` and `q[511]`, the neighbors outside the array (`q[-1]` and `q[512]`) are assumed to be zero.\n\n3. **Sequential Logic**:\n   - The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring that all updates to the state are synchronized with the clock.\n   - The `q_next` register is used to compute the next state of the automaton before updating `q`, ensuring that all cells are updated simultaneously.\n\n4. **Coding Conventions**:\n   - The module uses `logic` for all signals, adhering to modern SystemVerilog conventions.\n   - The `always` block does not explicitly specify a sensitivity list, as it is triggered by the clock edge.\n   - The implementation avoids using `wire` or `reg`, and all numeric constants are properly sized.\n\nThis design ensures that the automaton behaves correctly according to the specified rules and interfaces.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input logic clk,\n    input logic load,\n    input logic [511:0] data,\n    output logic [511:0] q\n);\n\n    logic [511:0] q_next;\n\n    always @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (load) begin\n            q <= data;\n        end else begin\n            q_next[0] <= q[1]; // q[-1] is 0\n            q_next[511] <= q[510]; // q[512] is 0\n            for (int i = 1; i < 511; i++) begin\n                q_next[i] <= q[i-1] ^ q[i+1];\n            end\n            q <= q_next;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
