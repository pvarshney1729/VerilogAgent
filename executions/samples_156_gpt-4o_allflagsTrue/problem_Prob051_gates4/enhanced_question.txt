Module Name: TopModule

Interface Description:
- Inputs:
  - `input [3:0] in` : A 4-bit wide input vector where `in[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).

- Outputs:
  - `output out_and` : Single bit output representing the result of a 4-input AND operation on the input vector.
  - `output out_or`  : Single bit output representing the result of a 4-input OR operation on the input vector.
  - `output out_xor` : Single bit output representing the result of a 4-input XOR operation on the input vector.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a purely combinational logic circuit with no internal state or memory elements. 
- The outputs are directly derived from the inputs through standard logic operations as follows:
  1. `out_and` is the logical AND of all bits in the input vector `in[3:0]`.
  2. `out_or` is the logical OR of all bits in the input vector `in[3:0]`.
  3. `out_xor` is the logical XOR of all bits in the input vector `in[3:0]`.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the logic circuit is designed to operate without any clock signals, as it is entirely combinational.
- The operations are performed on the entire 4-bit input simultaneously, with no sequential processing or delay elements involved.
- The module must not include provisions for resets or initial states, as the outputs are directly dependent on the current input values.

Edge Cases:
- If all bits of the input vector `in[3:0]` are `0`, then `out_and` will be `0`, `out_or` will be `0`, and `out_xor` will be `0`.
- If all bits of the input vector `in[3:0]` are `1`, then `out_and` will be `1`, `out_or` will be `1`, and `out_xor` will be `0`.
