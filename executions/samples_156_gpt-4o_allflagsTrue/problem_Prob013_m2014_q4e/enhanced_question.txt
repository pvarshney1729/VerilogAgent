Module Specification: TopModule

1. Module Interface:
   - Input Ports:
     - `input wire in1`: A single-bit input signal representing the first operand for the NOR operation.
     - `input wire in2`: A single-bit input signal representing the second operand for the NOR operation.
   
   - Output Ports:
     - `output wire out`: A single-bit output signal representing the result of the NOR operation.

2. Design Requirements:
   - The module implements a 2-input NOR gate. The output `out` is the logical NOR of inputs `in1` and `in2`.
   - Logic Definition:
     - `out = ~(in1 | in2)`, where `|` denotes the logical OR operation, and `~` denotes the logical NOT operation.
   
3. Signal and Operation Details:
   - Inputs `in1` and `in2` are considered active high, meaning a logical '1' is represented by a high voltage level.
   - The output `out` is also active high, producing a logical '1' only when both `in1` and `in2` are logical '0'.

4. Additional Notes:
   - This module is purely combinational and does not include any sequential logic elements such as flip-flops or registers.
   - The design does not require any clock signal or reset logic as it operates purely on input changes.
   - All operations are assumed to be bitwise since the inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.
