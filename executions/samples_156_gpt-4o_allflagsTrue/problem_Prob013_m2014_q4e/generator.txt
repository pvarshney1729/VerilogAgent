<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that functions as a 2-input NOR gate. The NOR gate is a basic digital logic gate that outputs true or high only when both inputs are false or low. The provided guidelines and conventions suggest using `logic` for port declarations and using an `assign` statement for combinational logic. Since the NOR gate is purely combinational and does not require a clock or reset, we can directly use an `assign` statement to define the output. The expression `~(in1 | in2)` effectively implements the NOR operation by first performing a bitwise OR on the inputs and then negating the result.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic in1,
    input logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Implementing the 2-input NOR gate
    assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
[DONE]
