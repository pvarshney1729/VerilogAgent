Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification: TopModule\n\n1. Module Interface:\n   - Input Ports:\n     - `input wire in1`: A single-bit input signal representing the first operand for the NOR operation.\n     - `input wire in2`: A single-bit input signal representing the second operand for the NOR operation.\n   \n   - Output Ports:\n     - `output wire out`: A single-bit output signal representing the result of the NOR operation.\n\n2. Design Requirements:\n   - The module implements a 2-input NOR gate. The output `out` is the logical NOR of inputs `in1` and `in2`.\n   - Logic Definition:\n     - `out = ~(in1 | in2)`, where `|` denotes the logical OR operation, and `~` denotes the logical NOT operation.\n   \n3. Signal and Operation Details:\n   - Inputs `in1` and `in2` are considered active high, meaning a logical '1' is represented by a high voltage level.\n   - The output `out` is also active high, producing a logical '1' only when both `in1` and `in2` are logical '0'.\n\n4. Additional Notes:\n   - This module is purely combinational and does not include any sequential logic elements such as flip-flops or registers.\n   - The design does not require any clock signal or reset logic as it operates purely on input changes.\n   - All operations are assumed to be bitwise since the inputs and outputs are single-bit signals.\n                    "
