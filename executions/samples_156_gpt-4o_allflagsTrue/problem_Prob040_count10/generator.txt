<REASONING>
To implement the decade counter as specified, we need a 4-bit register to hold the count value, which will be output through the port `q`. The counter should increment from 0 to 9 and then wrap back to 0. The reset is synchronous, meaning it should only affect the counter on the rising edge of the clock.

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with inputs `clk` and `reset`, and a 4-bit output `q`.

2. **Register Declaration**: We declare a 4-bit logic register `count` to hold the current count value.

3. **Sequential Logic**: We use an `always_ff` block triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to implement the counter logic. Inside this block:
   - If `reset` is high, we set `count` to 0.
   - If `count` reaches 9 (4'b1001), we reset it to 0 on the next clock cycle.
   - Otherwise, we increment `count` by 1.

4. **Output Assignment**: We assign the value of `count` to the output `q`.

This implementation adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided, ensuring synchronous reset and correct counter operation.
