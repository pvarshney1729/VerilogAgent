All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.\n  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal, 1 bit.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [3:0] q`: 4-bit output representing the current count of the decade counter.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9, inclusive, with a total cycle period of 10 clock cycles.\n- Counting operation is triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- When `reset` is asserted (high) during a positive clock edge, the counter output `q` is synchronously reset to 4'b0000 (binary representation of 0).\n- In normal operation (when `reset` is low), the counter increments its value by 1 on each positive clock edge.\n- Once the counter reaches the value of 4'b1001 (binary representation of 9), it wraps around to 4'b0000 on the next clock cycle.\n\nAdditional Details:\n- Bit Indexing: `q[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB), and `q[3]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n- Reset State: When `reset` is asserted, `q` is set to 4'b0000.\n- Initial Value: At power-up, the output `q` should be initialized to 4'b0000.\n- Edge Cases: Ensure that the counter correctly wraps from 9 back to 0 without skipping or holding values.\n                    "
