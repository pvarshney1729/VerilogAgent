<REASONING>
To implement the `TopModule` for counting the number of '1's in a 255-bit input vector, we will follow these steps:

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The input is a 255-bit vector, and the output is an 8-bit vector.

2. **Population Count Logic**: We will use a combinational logic block to count the number of '1's in the input vector. This will be done using an `always @(*)` block to ensure that the logic is combinational and reacts to any changes in the input.

3. **Output Assignment**: The result of the population count will be assigned to the output port `out`.

4. **Coding Conventions**: We will adhere to the specified coding conventions, using `logic` for all signals and ensuring all numeric constants have a size greater than zero.

5. **No Synchronous Reset**: Since the specification does not mention a clock or reset, we will implement this as a purely combinational module without any sequential logic or reset conditions.

6. **Efficiency**: The implementation will efficiently sum the bits of the input vector using a loop within the `always @(*)` block.

By following these steps, we ensure that the module meets the specification and adheres to the provided guidelines and coding conventions.
