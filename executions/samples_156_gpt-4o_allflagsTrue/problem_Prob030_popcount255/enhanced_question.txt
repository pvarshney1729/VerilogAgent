Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input [254:0] in`: A 255-bit input vector where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[254]` is the most significant bit (MSB).
- Output Ports:
  - `output [7:0] out`: An 8-bit output vector representing the count of '1's in the input vector.

Functionality:
- The `TopModule` is designed to perform a "population count" on the 255-bit input vector. The population count is the total number of bits set to '1' in the input vector `in`.
- The result of the population count is output through `out`, which is capable of representing values from 0 to 255, corresponding to the number of '1's in the input vector.

Operational Details:
- The module implements combinational logic, meaning that the output `out` is directly dependent on the current state of the input `in` and does not involve any clocked elements or sequential logic.
- There are no internal registers or flip-flops; hence, no reset conditions are required.
- The operation is purely combinational and should have no race conditions or dependencies on clock edges.

Edge Cases:
- When the input `in` has all bits set to '0' (i.e., `in = 255'b0`), the output `out` should be `8'b0`.
- When the input `in` has all bits set to '1' (i.e., `in = 255'b1`), the output `out` should be `8'b11111111` (or `8'd255` in decimal).

Boundary Conditions:
- The input vector `in` can have any combination of '0's and '1's, and the output should accurately reflect the number of '1's present in the input.
