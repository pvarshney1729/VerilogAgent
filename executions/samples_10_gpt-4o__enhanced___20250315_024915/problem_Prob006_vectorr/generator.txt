Following your requirements and guidelines, here is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that reverses the bit ordering of an 8-bit input.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] out
);

    // Combinational logic to reverse the bits of the input
    always @(*) begin
        out[0] = in[7];
        out[1] = in[6];
        out[2] = in[5];
        out[3] = in[4];
        out[4] = in[3];
        out[5] = in[2];
        out[6] = in[1];
        out[7] = in[0];
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports declared as `logic` types which adheres to your coding conventions.
   
2. **Input/Output Specification**: The input `in` is defined as an 8-bit vector, and the output `out` is also defined as an 8-bit vector.

3. **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block is used to specify that the output `out` should be continuously driven based on the input `in`. This allows for the bit reversal to happen immediately when `in` changes.

4. **Bit Reversal Implementation**: Each bit of the output is assigned the corresponding reversed bit from the input. For instance, `out[0]` takes the value of `in[7]`, `out[1]` takes the value of `in[6]`, and so on.

5. **No Reset Logic**: Since the requirement did not specify a synchronous reset, it is not included in the design. The output will continuously reflect the state of the input.

This implementation meets all specified guidelines and conventions while correctly performing the task of reversing the bit order of the input signal.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] out
);

    // Combinational logic to reverse the bits of the input
    always @(*) begin
        out[0] = in[7];
        out[1] = in[6];
        out[2] = in[5];
        out[3] = in[4];
        out[4] = in[3];
        out[5] = in[2];
        out[6] = in[1];
        out[7] = in[0];
    end
