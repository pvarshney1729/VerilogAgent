All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in  (8 bits)\n - output out (8 bits)\n\nThe module should reverse the bit ordering of the input port and write\nthe result to the output port.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input [7:0] in: An 8-bit input signal, where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[7] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output [7:0] out: An 8-bit output signal, where the ordering of bits is reversed from the input signal.\n\nFunctionality:\nThe module shall reverse the bit ordering of the 8-bit input port `in` such that:\n- If `in` = {in[7], in[6], in[5], in[4], in[3], in[2], in[1], in[0]}`, then `out` shall equal {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]}.\n\nBehavioral Description:\n- The operation of reversing the bit ordering is combinational logic and should be performed instantaneously upon the change of the input signal.\n- The output signal `out` should reflect the reversed bit ordering of `in` without any propagation delay assumption.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module shall handle all possible values of `in`, including all-zero and all-one inputs, and should verify that the output `out` is correctly reflecting the expected reversed order in these cases.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- No reset functionality is specified in the original requirements. If a reset is required, please specify if it should be synchronous or asynchronous and the reset state for the output.\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output `out` is directly dependent on the input `in`. There are no additional signal dependencies or precedence of operations.\n\nPerformance Considerations:\n- Ensure that the implementation is optimized for combinational logic to prevent unnecessary delays in output.\n                    "
