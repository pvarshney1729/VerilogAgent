Module Name: TopModule

Description: This module is designed to reverse the byte order of a 32-bit input vector. The output will also be a 32-bit vector reflecting the reversed byte order of the input.

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 32 bits
  - Signedness: Unsigned
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 32 bits
  - Signedness: Unsigned
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).

Functionality:
- The module shall reverse the byte order of the 32-bit input vector such that:
  - out[7:0] = in[31:24]
  - out[15:8] = in[23:16]
  - out[23:16] = in[15:8]
  - out[31:24] = in[7:0]

Signal Dependencies:
- The output signal 'out' is combinational and directly depends on the input signal 'in'.
- There are no clock cycles or sequential logic elements in this module.

Reset Conditions:
- There are no synchronous or asynchronous reset conditions defined for this module.

Edge Cases:
- The behavior of the module is deterministic for all valid 32-bit input values.
- The specification does not need to handle undefined or non-standard input values as all inputs are assumed to be valid 32-bit unsigned values.

Implementation Notes:
- Ensure that the implementation adheres strictly to the defined bit indexing and byte order reversal.
