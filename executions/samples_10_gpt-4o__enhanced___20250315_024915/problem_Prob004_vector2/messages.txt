When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription: This module is designed to reverse the byte order of a 32-bit input vector. The output will also be a 32-bit vector reflecting the reversed byte order of the input.\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port:\n  - Name: in\n  - Width: 32 bits\n  - Signedness: Unsigned\n  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\n- Output Port:\n  - Name: out\n  - Width: 32 bits\n  - Signedness: Unsigned\n  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB) and bit[31] refers to the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module shall reverse the byte order of the 32-bit input vector such that:\n  - out[7:0] = in[31:24]\n  - out[15:8] = in[23:16]\n  - out[23:16] = in[15:8]\n  - out[31:24] = in[7:0]\n\nSignal Dependencies:\n- The output signal 'out' is combinational and directly depends on the input signal 'in'.\n- There are no clock cycles or sequential logic elements in this module.\n\nReset Conditions:\n- There are no synchronous or asynchronous reset conditions defined for this module.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The behavior of the module is deterministic for all valid 32-bit input values.\n- The specification does not need to handle undefined or non-standard input values as all inputs are assumed to be valid 32-bit unsigned values.\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Ensure that the implementation adheres strictly to the defined bit indexing and byte order reversal.\n                    "
