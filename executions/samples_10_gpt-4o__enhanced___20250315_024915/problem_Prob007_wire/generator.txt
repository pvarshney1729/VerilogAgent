Generated Response:

Based on your requirements and specifications, here is the implementation for the `TopModule` which behaves like a wire, connecting the input `in` directly to the output `out`.

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

    assign out = in;

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Reasoning:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and includes the specified input and output ports.
2. **Port Types**: Both the input `in` and the output `out` are declared as `logic` type, adhering to the coding conventions provided.
3. **Behavior**: The `assign` statement is used to continuously drive the output `out` with the value of the input `in`, effectively making it behave like a wire.
4. **Combinational Logic**: Since the functionality is purely combinational, there are no sequential elements or state management required, thus simplifying the design.
5. **Simplicity**: The implementation is straightforward without unnecessary complexity, following all provided guidelines and conventions correctly.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

    assign out = in;

endmodule
