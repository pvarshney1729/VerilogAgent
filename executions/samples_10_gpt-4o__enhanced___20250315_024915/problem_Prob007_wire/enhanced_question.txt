Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned, refers to the least significant bit)

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned, refers to the least significant bit)

Functional Specification:
- The module should behave as a direct wire connection between the input and output ports. Specifically, the output port 'out' should continuously reflect the value of the input port 'in' in a combinational manner.

Operational Characteristics:
- The output 'out' is defined as:
  - out = in

Timing and Control:
- This is a purely combinational logic module with no internal state or clocking mechanism.
- There are no flip-flops, registers, or sequential elements involved in this design.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- Since both 'in' and 'out' are single-bit signals, valid input values are limited to 0 (low) or 1 (high). The module should handle these values without any additional processing or constraints.

Reset Behavior:
- There is no reset functionality or state initialization required in this module as it operates purely as a wire.
