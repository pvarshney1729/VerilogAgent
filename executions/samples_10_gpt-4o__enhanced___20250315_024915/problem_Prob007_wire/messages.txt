All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n - input  in\n - output out\n\nThe module should behave like a wire.\n</Question>\n\n\n\nThe following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:\n<Guidelines>\n- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.\n- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.\n- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.\n- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.\n- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.\n- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.\n</Guidelines>\n\nHere are some additional rules and coding conventions.\n<Coding Conventions>\n - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.\n - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify\n   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).\n - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero\n   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).\n - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never\n   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in\n   situations where there is no need to read any signals.\n - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset\n   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here. Think step by step.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\nIMPORTANT: Enclose your code with [BEGIN] and [DONE].\n</CODE>\n"

        "content": "Here is the enhanced specification which might be useful:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nPort Interface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - in: bit[0] (1-bit input, unsigned, refers to the least significant bit)\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - out: bit[0] (1-bit output, unsigned, refers to the least significant bit)\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module should behave as a direct wire connection between the input and output ports. Specifically, the output port 'out' should continuously reflect the value of the input port 'in' in a combinational manner.\n\nOperational Characteristics:\n- The output 'out' is defined as:\n  - out = in\n\nTiming and Control:\n- This is a purely combinational logic module with no internal state or clocking mechanism.\n- There are no flip-flops, registers, or sequential elements involved in this design.\n\nEdge Cases and Input Boundaries:\n- Since both 'in' and 'out' are single-bit signals, valid input values are limited to 0 (low) or 1 (high). The module should handle these values without any additional processing or constraints.\n\nReset Behavior:\n- There is no reset functionality or state initialization required in this module as it operates purely as a wire.\n                    "
