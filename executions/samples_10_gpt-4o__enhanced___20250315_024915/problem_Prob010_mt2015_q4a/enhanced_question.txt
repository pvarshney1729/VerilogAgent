Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input logic x;  // 1-bit input (x[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  - input logic y;  // 1-bit input (y[0] refers to the least significant bit)
  
- Output Ports:
  - output logic z;  // 1-bit output (z[0] refers to the least significant bit)

Functional Specification:
- The module implements the boolean function defined by the equation:
  z = (x XOR y) AND x
- The operations are to be performed based on the following precedence:
  1. XOR operation between inputs x and y.
  2. AND operation between the result of the XOR and input x.

Signal Dependencies:
- The output z is combinationally dependent on inputs x and y.
- There are no sequential elements or clock cycles involved in this module.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The module is designed for binary inputs; therefore, inputs x and y will only take values of 0 or 1.
- The output z will also strictly be either 0 or 1 based on the provided boolean function.

Reset Conditions:
- No reset conditions are applicable for this module as it purely implements combinational logic.
