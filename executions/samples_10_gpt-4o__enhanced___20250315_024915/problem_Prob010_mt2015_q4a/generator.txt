Generated Response:

Based on the provided specifications and guidelines, here is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog. The module takes two 1-bit inputs, `x` and `y`, and produces a 1-bit output, `z`, according to the specified boolean function.

### Reasoning
1. **Input and Output Declaration**: The inputs `x` and `y` are declared as `logic` type, as well as the output `z`.
2. **Combinational Logic**: Since `z` is a combinational output depending on `x` and `y`, we will use an `always @(*)` block to compute `z`.
3. **Boolean Function Implementation**: The function `z = (x ^ y) & x` is implemented directly inside the always block.
4. **No Reset Logic**: As specified, there is no synchronous reset condition since this module does not have any sequential elements.

### Verilog Code
Here is the complete code for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic x,
    input logic y,
    output logic z
);

    always @(*) begin
        z = (x ^ y) & x;
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code
- The module is named `TopModule` and has the specified input and output ports.
- The `always @(*)` block is used to ensure that the output `z` is updated whenever there is a change in inputs `x` or `y`.
- The expression `(x ^ y) & x` computes the value of `z` according to the desired boolean function.
- This implementation adheres to the coding conventions and guidelines provided, ensuring correct syntax and logic generation.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input logic x,
    input logic y,
    output logic z
);

    always @(*) begin
        z = (x ^ y) & x;
    end

endmodule
