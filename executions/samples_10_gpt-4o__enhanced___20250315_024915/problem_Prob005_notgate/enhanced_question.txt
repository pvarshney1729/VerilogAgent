Module Name: TopModule

Port Interface:
- Input:
  - in: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned) 
    - Description: This input represents a single binary value.

- Output:
  - out: bit[0] (1-bit, unsigned) 
    - Description: This output represents the logical negation of the input.

Functional Description:
- The TopModule implements a combinational logic element that functions as a NOT gate. 
- The output 'out' is computed as follows:
  - out = NOT(in) 
    - where 'NOT' operation inverts the input signal. 

Timing Characteristics:
- The module operates in a purely combinational logic manner; there are no clock cycles or sequential elements involved.
- The output 'out' will reflect the logical negation of 'in' immediately when 'in' changes, with no propagation delay specified.

Reset Characteristics:
- There are no reset conditions specified for this module, as it is purely combinational and does not maintain state.

Edge Cases:
- For input 'in' = 0, the output 'out' will be 1.
- For input 'in' = 1, the output 'out' will be 0.
- The module does not handle undefined or out-of-bounds input conditions, as inputs are constrained to binary values (0 or 1).
