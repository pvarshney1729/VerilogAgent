Based on the specifications provided, I will implement the `TopModule` as a simple NOT gate using combinational logic. The interface consists of one input and one output, both of which are one-bit signals. The output will be the logical negation of the input.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the implementation:

1. **Module Declaration**: Start by declaring the module with the name `TopModule`.
2. **Port Declaration**: Define the input and output ports as specified.
3. **Logic Implementation**: Since this is a combinational logic implementation, I will use an `always @(*)` block to define the behavior of the NOT operation.
4. **Signal Declaration**: All signals will be declared as `logic`, adhering to the coding conventions.
5. **Output Assignment**: The output will be assigned the negation of the input.

Now, here is the complete Verilog code for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = ~in; // NOT operation
    end

endmodule
[DONE]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has two ports: `in` as an input and `out` as an output.
- **Input and Output Types**: Both ports are declared as `logic`, following the specified conventions.
- **Combinational Logic**: The `always @(*)` block ensures that the output `out` is always updated based on the current value of `in`. The negation is performed using the bitwise NOT operator `~`.

This implementation meets all the requirements as outlined in your request, including proper signal types and combinational logic structure.

Generated Code:

module TopModule (
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

    always @(*) begin
        out = ~in; // NOT operation
    end

endmodule
