Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - in: bit[2:0] (3 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 3-bit input vector representing the data for which the population count will be computed. 
    - Bit Indexing: 
      - bit[0]: Least Significant Bit (LSB)
      - bit[2]: Most Significant Bit (MSB)

- Output Ports:
  - out: bit[1:0] (2 bits, unsigned)
    - Description: A 2-bit output representing the number of '1's in the input vector. 
    - The value will range from 0 to 3, corresponding to a possible population count for the 3-bit input.

Functional Specification:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit that computes the population count of the input vector 'in'.
- The output 'out' will be updated based on the current state of 'in' without any clock dependencies or delays.

Edge Case Behavior:
- If 'in' is all '0's (000), then 'out' should be 2'b00.
- If 'in' has one '1' (e.g., 001, 010, or 100), then 'out' should be 2'b01.
- If 'in' has two '1's (e.g., 011, 101, or 110), then 'out' should be 2'b10.
- If 'in' has three '1's (111), then 'out' should be 2'b11.

Implementation Considerations:
- Ensure that the combinational logic correctly handles all possible values of 'in' and does not have any race conditions.
- Verify that the output 'out' is stable and reflects the correct population count within the same logic cycle as the input 'in'.
