<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port:
  - Name: in
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Signedness: Unsigned
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB)

- Output Port:
  - Name: out
  - Width: 1 bit
  - Signedness: Unsigned
  - Bit Indexing: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB)

Functional Description:
- The module shall perform a combinational operation where the output port "out" will be continuously assigned the same value as the input port "in". This assignment reflects the immediate value of the input without any delay or clock dependency.

Timing Characteristics:
- The module operates purely combinationally, with no clock inputs or sequential elements involved.

Reset Behavior:
- No reset functionality is defined for this module.

Edge Case Behavior:
- When the input "in" is at a logic high (1), the output "out" shall reflect a logic high (1).
- When the input "in" is at a logic low (0), the output "out" shall reflect a logic low (0).

Signal Dependencies:
- The output "out" is directly dependent on the input "in". There are no other signals or conditions that influence the assignment of "out".
