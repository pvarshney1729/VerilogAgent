Module Name: TopModule

Description:
The TopModule is a combinational logic module that outputs a constant low signal.

Interface:
- Output Ports:
  - zero: 1-bit output (unsigned)
    - Description: The output signal 'zero' shall always reflect a logic LOW state.

Specifications:
1. The output 'zero' shall always be driven to a logic level of '0' (LOW).
2. The output 'zero' is defined as follows:
   - MSB/LSB: bit[0] refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - Output state: zero = 0.
3. The module does not contain any input ports, and therefore, does not rely on any external signals.

Behavior:
- The output 'zero' remains stable at LOW regardless of any input conditions, as there are no inputs to influence its state.

Edge Cases:
- There are no edge cases or boundary conditions to consider, as the output is constant and does not change with varying inputs.
