<REASONING>
The task is to implement a 256-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog. The module, named `TopModule`, has a 256-bit input vector `in`, an 8-bit selector `sel`, and a 1-bit output `out`. The selector `sel` determines which bit from the input vector `in` is routed to the output `out`. The implementation uses a simple combinational logic assignment to achieve this functionality. The `assign` statement is used to directly map the selected bit from the input vector to the output, based on the index provided by `sel`. This approach is efficient and adheres to the guidelines and coding conventions provided.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [255:0] in,
    input  logic [7:0]   sel,
    output logic         out
);
    // Combinational logic for 256-to-1 multiplexer
    assign out = in[sel];
endmodule
