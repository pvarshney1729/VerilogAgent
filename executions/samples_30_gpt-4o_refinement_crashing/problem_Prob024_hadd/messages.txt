        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nDescription:\nThe TopModule implements a half adder. A half adder is a combinational circuit that takes two single-bit binary numbers as input and produces a sum bit and a carry-out bit as output.\n\nInterface Specification:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input wire a`: Single-bit input. Represents the first bit to be added.\n  - `input wire b`: Single-bit input. Represents the second bit to be added.\n\n- Outputs:\n  - `output wire sum`: Single-bit output. Represents the least significant bit (LSB) of the addition result.\n  - `output wire cout`: Single-bit output. Represents the carry-out bit of the addition.\n\nLogical Functionality:\n- The half adder produces the sum and carry-out based on the following logical expressions:\n  - `sum = a XOR b`: The sum output is the result of the XOR operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n  - `cout = a AND b`: The carry-out output is the result of the AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`.\n\nBit Indexing:\n- Since all signals are single-bit, bit indexing is not applicable. However, if extended in the future, consider `bit[0]` as the least significant bit.\n\nCombinational Logic:\n- This module is purely combinational and has no clock or reset signals. All outputs are determined solely by the current input values without any memory or state retention.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module's behavior is fully defined for all possible combinations of the single-bit inputs `a` and `b` (i.e., 00, 01, 10, 11).\n\nNote: The half adder does not account for any carry-in bit, differentiating it from a full adder.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
