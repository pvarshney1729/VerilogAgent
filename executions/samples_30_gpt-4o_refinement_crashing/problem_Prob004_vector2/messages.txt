Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input wire [31:0] in`: A 32-bit input vector. Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `output reg [31:0] out`: A 32-bit output vector. Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module reverses the byte order of the 32-bit input vector `in` and assigns the result to the output vector `out`.\n- Byte order reversal involves swapping each 8-bit byte in the 32-bit vector. \n  - This means the byte at bit positions [31:24] is swapped with [7:0], [23:16] is swapped with [15:8], and vice versa.\n\n- The operation is purely combinational, so there are no clock or reset signals involved.\n\n- Example:\n  - If `in` is `32'h12345678`, then `out` should be `32'h78563412`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The operation handles all possible 32-bit values for `in` and does not depend on any specific patterns or conditions in the input data.\n- There are no undefined or illegal input conditions.\n\nNote:\n- All operations are bitwise and independent of signedness, as the data is considered an unsigned bit vector.\n                    "
