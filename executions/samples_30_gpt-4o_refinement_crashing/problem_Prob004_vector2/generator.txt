<REASONING>
The task is to reverse the byte order of a 32-bit input vector and output the result. The module is purely combinational, so we use an `assign` statement to directly map the reversed byte order to the output. The input and output ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions provided. The byte reversal is achieved by reordering the 8-bit segments of the input vector. This is done by concatenating the bytes in reverse order: the least significant byte of the input becomes the most significant byte of the output, and so on.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic [31:0] in,
    output logic [31:0] out
);

    // Reverse the byte order of the input vector
    assign out = {in[7:0], in[15:8], in[23:16], in[31:24]};

endmodule
