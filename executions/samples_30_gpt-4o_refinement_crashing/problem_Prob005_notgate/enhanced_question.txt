<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input:
  - `input wire in`: A single-bit input signal.
- Output:
  - `output wire out`: A single-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a NOT gate, which performs bitwise negation on the input signal.
- The output `out` is the logical NOT of the input `in`.

Indexing and Signal Details:
- The input and output are single-bit signals, hence no bit indexing is necessary beyond indicating they are 1-bit wide.

Logical Operations:
- The operation performed is combinational logic, with `out = ~in`.
- No sequential logic, clocks, or resets are involved as this is purely combinational.

Edge Cases:
- The behavior is straightforward and defined for all possible single-bit input values (0 or 1).

Additional Clarifications:
- The module does not include internal storage elements or state.
- There are no dependencies on clock signals or external asynchronous or synchronous resets.
