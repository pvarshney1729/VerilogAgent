The task is to implement a simple NOT gate using Verilog. The module is named `TopModule` and has one input (`in`) and one output (`out`). The NOT gate operation is straightforward: it inverts the input signal. Given the guidelines and coding conventions, we will use `logic` for port declarations instead of `wire` or `reg`. Since this is purely combinational logic, we will use an `assign` statement to implement the NOT operation. There is no need for an `always` block because the operation does not depend on any clock or reset signals. The guidelines about synchronous reset and flip-flops do not apply here as there is no sequential logic involved.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic in,
    output logic out
);
    assign out = ~in;
endmodule
[DONE]
