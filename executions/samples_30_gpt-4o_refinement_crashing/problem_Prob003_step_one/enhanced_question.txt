<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output Ports:
  - `one`: 1-bit output port

Specifications:
1. The module `TopModule` shall have one output port named `one`, which is 1-bit wide.
2. The output port `one` must always be driven to a constant logic level '1' (logic high).
3. The module does not have any input ports.
4. The module is purely combinational and does not contain any sequential elements, flip-flops, or registers.
5. The design does not require any clock signal, as there is no sequential logic involved.
6. The module should not be affected by any external signals or states, given its purpose is to continuously drive a constant high signal.

Additional Notes:
- The output `one` should be driven high immediately upon instantiation and should remain high throughout the operation of the module.
- No reset logic is required, as there are no stateful elements.
- The implementation should adhere strictly to the requirement of driving the output `one` constantly high, without any conditional or timed dependencies.
