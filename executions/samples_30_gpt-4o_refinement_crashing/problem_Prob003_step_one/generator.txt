<REASONING>
The task is to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single output port `one` that is always driven to logic high (1). Given the simplicity of the task, there is no need for any input ports, clock signals, or reset logic. The module is purely combinational, and the output can be driven using a continuous assignment statement. The guidelines and coding conventions provided suggest using `logic` for port declarations and using `assign` for combinational logic without an always block, which fits perfectly for this task. The module will be straightforward, with a single line of code to drive the output high.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic one
);

    // Drive the output 'one' to logic high
    assign one = 1'b1;

endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
