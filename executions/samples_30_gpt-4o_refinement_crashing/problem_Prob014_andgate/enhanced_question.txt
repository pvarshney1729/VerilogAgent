Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a  // Single bit input, representing input A of the AND gate
  - input wire b  // Single bit input, representing input B of the AND gate
- Output Ports:
  - output wire out // Single bit output, representing the result of the AND operation

Functionality Description:
- The module implements a 2-input AND gate. It performs a logical AND operation on the input signals 'a' and 'b'.
- The output 'out' is driven by the result of the operation: out = a & b.

Signal and Operation Details:
- The inputs 'a' and 'b' are treated as binary values where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.
- The output 'out' will be high (logic 1) if and only if both inputs 'a' and 'b' are high (logic 1).
- This is a purely combinational logic module with no clock or reset signals involved.

Edge Cases:
- There are no special edge cases for a 2-input AND gate beyond the standard truth table:
  - a = 0, b = 0 -> out = 0
  - a = 0, b = 1 -> out = 0
  - a = 1, b = 0 -> out = 0
  - a = 1, b = 1 -> out = 1
