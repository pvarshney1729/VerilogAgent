Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a  // Single bit input, representing input A of the AND gate\n  - input wire b  // Single bit input, representing input B of the AND gate\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out // Single bit output, representing the result of the AND operation\n\nFunctionality Description:\n- The module implements a 2-input AND gate. It performs a logical AND operation on the input signals 'a' and 'b'.\n- The output 'out' is driven by the result of the operation: out = a & b.\n\nSignal and Operation Details:\n- The inputs 'a' and 'b' are treated as binary values where bit[0] refers to the least significant bit.\n- The output 'out' will be high (logic 1) if and only if both inputs 'a' and 'b' are high (logic 1).\n- This is a purely combinational logic module with no clock or reset signals involved.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- There are no special edge cases for a 2-input AND gate beyond the standard truth table:\n  - a = 0, b = 0 -> out = 0\n  - a = 0, b = 1 -> out = 0\n  - a = 1, b = 0 -> out = 0\n  - a = 1, b = 1 -> out = 1\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
