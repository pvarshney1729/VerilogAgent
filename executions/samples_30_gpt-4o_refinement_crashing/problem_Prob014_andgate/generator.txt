<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple 2-input AND gate using Verilog. The module is named `TopModule` and has two input ports `a` and `b`, and one output port `out`. The output should be the result of the logical AND operation on the inputs `a` and `b`. Since this is a purely combinational logic circuit, we will use an `assign` statement to directly map the result of the AND operation to the output. The guidelines and conventions provided suggest using `logic` instead of `wire` or `reg`, but since we are using an `assign` statement, `wire` is appropriate for the output. There is no need for a clock or reset signal as this is a simple combinational logic gate.

[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    output logic out
);

    assign out = a & b;
