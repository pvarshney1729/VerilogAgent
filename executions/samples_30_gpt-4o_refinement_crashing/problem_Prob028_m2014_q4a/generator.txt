<REASONING>
To implement the D latch as specified, we need to create a module named `TopModule` with the given interface. The D latch should store the value of the input `d` when the enable signal `ena` is high. The output `q` should follow the input `d` when `ena` is high, and retain its value when `ena` is low. 

1. **Module Declaration**: We declare the module `TopModule` with inputs `d` and `ena`, and output `q`. All ports are declared as `logic` to adhere to the coding conventions.

2. **Always Block**: We use an `always @(*)` block to describe the combinational logic of the D latch. This block is sensitive to any changes in the inputs `d` and `ena`.

3. **Latch Logic**: Inside the `always` block, we check if `ena` is high. If it is, we assign the value of `d` to `q`. If `ena` is low, `q` retains its previous value, which is the natural behavior of a latch.

4. **No Synchronous Reset**: The specification does not mention a reset signal, so we do not implement any reset logic.

5. **Coding Conventions**: We follow the guidelines by using `logic` for signal declarations and using `always @(*)` for combinational logic without explicitly specifying the sensitivity list.

This implementation ensures that the D latch behaves correctly according to the specification and adheres to the provided coding conventions.
