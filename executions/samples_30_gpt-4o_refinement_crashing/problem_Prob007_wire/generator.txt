<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple Verilog module named `TopModule` that acts as a wire, meaning the output `out` should directly reflect the input `in`. Based on the guidelines and coding conventions provided, we need to ensure that:

1. The module interface strictly follows the specification with a single input and output, both being 1-bit.
2. The module is purely combinational, so we will use an `assign` statement to directly connect the input to the output.
3. We will declare ports using `logic` as per the coding conventions, although for such a simple wire module, `wire` is typically used. However, to adhere to the conventions, we will use `logic`.
4. There is no need for a clock or reset signal since the module is combinational and acts as a direct wire.
5. We will not use an `always` block since the operation is purely combinational and does not require reading any signals beyond the input.

Given these considerations, the implementation is straightforward and involves declaring the module, defining the ports, and using an `assign` statement to connect the input to the output.
