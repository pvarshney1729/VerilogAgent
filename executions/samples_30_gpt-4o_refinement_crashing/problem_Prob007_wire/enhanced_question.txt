Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in` : 1-bit input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out` : 1-bit output signal.

Functional Description:
- The module `TopModule` functions as a direct wire connection. The output `out` continuously mirrors the input `in` without any delay or modification.

Port Naming Conventions:
- All signal names are written in lowercase to maintain consistency and readability.

Signal Details:
- Since this module serves as a direct wire, there are no internal registers, flip-flops, or sequential elements. Therefore, no clock or reset signals are required.

Behavioral Notes:
- The module operates purely combinationally, with the output `out` reflecting any changes in the input `in` immediately.
- There are no edge cases or boundary conditions to consider beyond ensuring the input and output ports are correctly connected.

MSB/LSB and Bit Indexing:
- The input and output are both single-bit signals, so there is no need for MSB/LSB notation or bit indexing.
