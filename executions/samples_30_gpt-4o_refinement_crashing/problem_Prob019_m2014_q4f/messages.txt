Each port is a single-bit signal unless otherwise specified:\n\n- Input: `in1` (1 bit, unsigned)\n- Input: `in2` (1 bit, unsigned)\n- Output: `out` (1 bit, unsigned)\n\nDescription of the circuit behavior:\n\n1. The module implements combinational logic with no sequential or state elements involved.\n2. The input `in2` is inverted before being fed into an AND gate. This is equivalent to applying a NOT operation on `in2` before the AND operation.\n3. The inputs to the AND gate are:\n   - `in1` (directly)\n   - NOT `in2` (where NOT represents the logical negation of `in2`)\n\n4. The output `out` is the result of the AND operation between `in1` and NOT `in2`.\n\n5. The logical operation can be expressed as:\n   - `out = in1 AND (NOT in2)`\n\n6. This module is purely combinational with zero propagation delay assumed for the logic gate operations.\n\nThere are no clock, reset, or sequential elements involved, thus no need to specify their behavior.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Since all inputs are binary (1 bit), the edge cases naturally include all possible combinations of `in1` and `in2`, which are handled by the described logic.\n                    "
