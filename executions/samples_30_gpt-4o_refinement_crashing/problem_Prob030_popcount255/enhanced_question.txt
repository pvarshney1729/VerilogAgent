Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specification:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic [254:0] in`: A 255-bit input vector where `in[0]` represents the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[254]` represents the most significant bit (MSB).
- Output Ports:
  - `output logic [7:0] out`: An 8-bit output representing the population count of the input vector.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a population count circuit that calculates the number of '1's present in the 255-bit input vector `in`.
- The result is provided on the 8-bit output `out`.

Design Details:
- Combinational Logic: The population count is determined using combinational logic. There are no sequential elements (e.g., flip-flops or registers) involved in this computation.
- Output Range: Given a 255-bit input, the maximum possible count of '1's is 255, which fits within the provided 8-bit output (`0 to 255`).

Edge Case Handling:
- All bits of the input vector are considered in the calculation regardless of their value.
- The output `out` will be `8'b00000000` if all bits of the input vector are '0', and `8'b11111111` (i.e., `255` in decimal) if all bits are '1'.

Timing and Clocking:
- Since the design is purely combinational, there are no clock or reset signals involved.

Note: Ensure that the output `out` updates immediately in response to changes in the input `in` due to the combinational nature of the design.
