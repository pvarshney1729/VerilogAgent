<REASONING>
The task is to implement a 2-input NOR gate using Verilog. The NOR gate is a basic digital logic gate that outputs true or high only when both inputs are false or low. The specification requires a module named `TopModule` with two 1-bit inputs (`in1` and `in2`) and one 1-bit output (`out`). The guidelines and coding conventions provided suggest using `logic` for all ports and signals, and to use an `assign` statement for combinational logic instead of an `always` block. Since the NOR gate is purely combinational, it doesn't require a clock or reset signal. The output is simply the negation of the OR operation on the inputs.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic in1,
    input logic in2,
    output logic out
);

    // Implementing the 2-input NOR gate
    assign out = ~(in1 | in2);

endmodule
[DONE]
