It represents one of the inputs to the NOR gate.\n  - `in2`: 1-bit wide, unsigned. It represents the other input to the NOR gate.\n- Output:\n  - `out`: 1-bit wide, unsigned. It represents the output of the NOR gate.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- This module implements a combinational logic circuit, specifically a 2-input NOR gate.\n- The NOR gate performs a logical NOR operation on the inputs `in1` and `in2`.\n\nSignal Operations:\n- The output `out` is computed as the logical NOR of the inputs `in1` and `in2`.\n- Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n  - `out = ~(in1 | in2)`\n\nBit Conventions:\n- Each input and output is a single bit.\n- Bit[0] is the only bit and refers to the entire signal.\n\nTiming and Reset:\n- As this is a combinational logic module, there are no clock signals, resets, or sequential logic elements involved.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- When both `in1` and `in2` are `0`, the output `out` will be `1`.\n- When either `in1` or `in2` is `1`, or both are `1`, the output `out` will be `0`.\n                    "
