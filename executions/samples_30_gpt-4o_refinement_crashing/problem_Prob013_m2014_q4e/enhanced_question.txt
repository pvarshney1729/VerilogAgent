Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input: 
  - `in1`: 1-bit wide, unsigned. It represents one of the inputs to the NOR gate.
  - `in2`: 1-bit wide, unsigned. It represents the other input to the NOR gate.
- Output:
  - `out`: 1-bit wide, unsigned. It represents the output of the NOR gate.

Functional Description:
- This module implements a combinational logic circuit, specifically a 2-input NOR gate.
- The NOR gate performs a logical NOR operation on the inputs `in1` and `in2`.

Signal Operations:
- The output `out` is computed as the logical NOR of the inputs `in1` and `in2`.
- Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
  - `out = ~(in1 | in2)`

Bit Conventions:
- Each input and output is a single bit.
- Bit[0] is the only bit and refers to the entire signal.

Timing and Reset:
- As this is a combinational logic module, there are no clock signals, resets, or sequential logic elements involved.

Edge Cases:
- When both `in1` and `in2` are `0`, the output `out` will be `1`.
- When either `in1` or `in2` is `1`, or both are `1`, the output `out` will be `0`.
