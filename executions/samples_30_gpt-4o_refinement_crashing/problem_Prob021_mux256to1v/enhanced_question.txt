Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Port: in
  - Width: 1024 bits
  - Description: This input vector contains all the 256 4-bit data entries. Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit.
  
- Input Port: sel
  - Width: 8 bits
  - Description: This selects which 4-bit segment from the 'in' vector is routed to the output. The most significant bit is bit[7], and the least significant bit is bit[0].

- Output Port: out
  - Width: 4 bits
  - Description: This output provides the selected 4-bit data based on the 'sel' input.

Functionality:
- The module functions as a combinational 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.
- Selection Logic: 
  - The 'sel' input defines which 4 bits from the 'in' vector are routed to the 'out' port.
  - If sel = 0, the bits from in[3:0] are selected.
  - If sel = 1, the bits from in[7:4] are selected.
  - This continues such that if sel = n, the bits from in[(4*n)+3:(4*n)] are selected.
  
- The 'sel' value should be within the range of 0 to 255. Values outside this range are considered invalid and can result in undefined behavior for 'out'.

- No sequential elements or clock dependencies exist in this module, ensuring purely combinational behavior.

- Edge Cases: 
  - Ensure that sel values strictly adhere to the 0-255 range for predictable behavior.
  - The module does not handle input vector 'in' changes; it assumes inputs are stable during each evaluation.

- Initial Values: 
  - No initial values are required as this is a combinational circuit without sequential elements.

- Reset Conditions: 
  - Not applicable, as the module does not utilize flip-flops or other sequential logic elements.
