Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Port: in\n  - Width: 1024 bits\n  - Description: This input vector contains all the 256 4-bit data entries. Bit indexing follows the convention where bit[0] is the least significant bit.\n  \n- Input Port: sel\n  - Width: 8 bits\n  - Description: This selects which 4-bit segment from the 'in' vector is routed to the output. The most significant bit is bit[7], and the least significant bit is bit[0].\n\n- Output Port: out\n  - Width: 4 bits\n  - Description: This output provides the selected 4-bit data based on the 'sel' input.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The module functions as a combinational 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.\n- Selection Logic: \n  - The 'sel' input defines which 4 bits from the 'in' vector are routed to the 'out' port.\n  - If sel = 0, the bits from in[3:0] are selected.\n  - If sel = 1, the bits from in[7:4] are selected.\n  - This continues such that if sel = n, the bits from in[(4*n)+3:(4*n)] are selected.\n  \n- The 'sel' value should be within the range of 0 to 255. Values outside this range are considered invalid and can result in undefined behavior for 'out'.\n\n- No sequential elements or clock dependencies exist in this module, ensuring purely combinational behavior.\n\n- Edge Cases: \n  - Ensure that sel values strictly adhere to the 0-255 range for predictable behavior.\n  - The module does not handle input vector 'in' changes; it assumes inputs are stable during each evaluation.\n\n- Initial Values: \n  - No initial values are required as this is a combinational circuit without sequential elements.\n\n- Reset Conditions: \n  - Not applicable, as the module does not utilize flip-flops or other sequential logic elements.\n                    "
