<REASONING>
The task is to implement a 1-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog. The module should have three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `sel`, and one output: `out`. The output `out` should be equal to `a` when `sel` is `0` and equal to `b` when `sel` is `1`. This is a simple combinational logic circuit, so an `assign` statement is appropriate for implementing the multiplexer logic. Since the guidelines suggest using `logic` instead of `wire` or `reg`, we will declare the ports as `logic`. There is no need for a synchronous reset or clock in this design as it is purely combinational.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic a,
    input  logic b,
    input  logic sel,
    output logic out
);

    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
[DONE]
