<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module named `TopModule` is required to implement a 1-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer. The following interface specifications should be adhered to:

- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire a`: A 1-bit wide input signal.
  - `input wire b`: A 1-bit wide input signal.
  - `input wire sel`: A 1-bit wide selection signal that determines the output.

- **Output:**
  - `output wire out`: A 1-bit wide output signal representing the selected input.

**Functional Description:**
- The module will operate as a combinational logic circuit.
- When `sel` is `0`, the output `out` should be equal to the input `a`.
- When `sel` is `1`, the output `out` should be equal to the input `b`.

**Additional Notes:**
- All signals are assumed to be active high.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all signals are 1-bit wide.
- No clock or reset signals are involved as this is a purely combinational circuit without any sequential logic.
- The module should handle all input combinations (logical 0 and 1 for each input) and produce a valid output based on the value of the `sel` signal.
- There are no race conditions or precedence issues in this simple multiplexer design.
