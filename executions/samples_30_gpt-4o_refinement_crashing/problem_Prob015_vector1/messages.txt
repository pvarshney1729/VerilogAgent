Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `in`: 16-bit wide input bus. This bus is unsigned and follows big-endian bit indexing, where `in[15]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out_hi`: 8-bit wide output bus that represents the upper byte of the input. This bus is unsigned and follows big-endian bit indexing, where `out_hi[7]` is the MSB and `out_hi[0]` is the LSB.\n  - `out_lo`: 8-bit wide output bus that represents the lower byte of the input. This bus is unsigned and follows big-endian bit indexing, where `out_lo[7]` is the MSB and `out_lo[0]` is the LSB.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a purely combinational circuit.\n- The input signal `in` is split into two separate 8-bit segments:\n  - `out_hi` is assigned the upper byte of `in`, specifically `in[15:8]`.\n  - `out_lo` is assigned the lower byte of `in`, specifically `in[7:0]`.\n- There are no sequential elements or state-holding components in the design; hence, no clock or reset signals are required.\n- Ensure that the outputs `out_hi` and `out_lo` change instantaneously in response to any changes in the input `in`.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- The module should operate correctly for all possible 16-bit input values, ranging from `0x0000` to `0xFFFF`.\n- Any changes in the `in` value must immediately reflect in the outputs `out_hi` and `out_lo`.\n                    "
