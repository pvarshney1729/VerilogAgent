<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - `input [99:0] a`: A 100-bit wide input vector, where `a[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `a[99]` is the most significant bit (MSB).
  - `input [99:0] b`: A 100-bit wide input vector, where `b[0]` is the LSB and `b[99]` is the MSB.
  - `input sel`: A 1-bit input signal used to select between inputs `a` and `b`.

- Outputs:
  - `output [99:0] out`: A 100-bit wide output vector, where `out[0]` is the LSB and `out[99]` is the MSB.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer:
  - If `sel` is `0`, the output `out` should be assigned the value of input vector `a`.
  - If `sel` is `1`, the output `out` should be assigned the value of input vector `b`.

Additional Notes:
- This is a purely combinational logic circuit; no clock or reset signals are required.
- There are no sequential elements; hence, no initial values or reset states are applicable.
- Ensure that the implementation handles all input combinations correctly, maintaining the integrity of the 100-bit input vectors.
