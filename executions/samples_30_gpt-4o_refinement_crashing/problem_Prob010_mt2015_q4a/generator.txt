<REASONING>
The task is to implement a combinational logic module named `TopModule` with inputs `x` and `y`, and output `z`. The function to be implemented is `z = (x ^ y) & x`. This is a simple combinational logic operation, so no clock or reset signals are needed. The guidelines suggest using `logic` for signal declarations and using continuous assignments for combinational logic. Since the operation is straightforward, we will use an `assign` statement to directly compute the output `z` from the inputs `x` and `y`.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic x,
    input logic y,
    output logic z
);

    assign z = (x ^ y) & x;

endmodule
[DONE]
