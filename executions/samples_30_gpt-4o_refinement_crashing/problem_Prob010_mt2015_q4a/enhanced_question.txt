Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: 
  - x (1 bit, unsigned)
  - y (1 bit, unsigned)
- Output:
  - z (1 bit, unsigned)

Functional Specification:
- The module computes the boolean function for the output `z` as follows:
  - `z = (x XOR y) AND x`
- The operation is combinational, meaning `z` is directly driven by the current values of `x` and `y` without any clocked elements.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- Inputs and output are single-bit signals, and thus, no bit indexing is required.

Timing and Edge Cases:
- As this is a purely combinational circuit, there is no concern for clock cycles, reset states, or initial values.
- The output `z` is immediately updated based on changes in `x` or `y`.

Considerations:
- Ensure proper handling of any changes in the inputs `x` and `y` to avoid unintended glitches.
- There are no race conditions or timing dependencies since the logic is combinational.
