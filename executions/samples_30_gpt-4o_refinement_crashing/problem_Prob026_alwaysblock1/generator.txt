<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with two 1-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) and two 1-bit outputs (`out_assign` and `out_alwaysblock`). The module should perform an AND operation on the inputs using two different methods: an `assign` statement and a combinational `always` block.

1. **Module Declaration**: Define the module `TopModule` with the specified inputs and outputs. Since the task does not specify the use of synchronous reset or initialization, we will focus on the combinational logic only.

2. **Assign Statement**: Use an `assign` statement to directly compute the AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`, assigning the result to `out_assign`.

3. **Combinational Always Block**: Use an `always @(*)` block to compute the AND operation between `a` and `b`, assigning the result to `out_alwaysblock`. The use of `always @(*)` ensures that the block is sensitive to any changes in the inputs.

4. **Coding Conventions**: Follow the provided coding conventions, such as using `logic` for signal declarations and ensuring that the `always` block is used correctly for combinational logic.

5. **Output**: The outputs should reflect the logical AND of inputs `a` and `b`.

The implementation will adhere to the specified interface and signal names, ensuring that the logic is purely combinational and responds instantaneously to input changes.
