Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - input wire a; // Single-bit input, representing the first operand of the AND gate.
  - input wire b; // Single-bit input, representing the second operand of the AND gate.

- Output Ports:
  - output wire out_assign; // Single-bit output, result of the AND operation using an assign statement.
  - output wire out_alwaysblock; // Single-bit output, result of the AND operation using a combinational always block.

Behavioral Description:
1. The module implements an AND gate functionality using two different methods:
   - An 'assign' statement to directly compute the AND operation between inputs 'a' and 'b' and assign the result to 'out_assign'.
   - A combinational 'always' block, sensitive to changes in inputs 'a' and 'b', to compute the AND operation and assign the result to 'out_alwaysblock'.

2. The outputs must reflect the logical AND of inputs 'a' and 'b', with the following truth table:
   - If a = 0 and b = 0, then out_assign = 0 and out_alwaysblock = 0.
   - If a = 0 and b = 1, then out_assign = 0 and out_alwaysblock = 0.
   - If a = 1 and b = 0, then out_assign = 0 and out_alwaysblock = 0.
   - If a = 1 and b = 1, then out_assign = 1 and out_alwaysblock = 1.

3. The module does not contain any sequential logic or require clock or reset signals, as it purely implements combinational logic.

4. The bit width for all signals is 1-bit, and they are unsigned. Bit indexing is not applicable as there are no multi-bit vectors.

5. There are no race conditions, as the logic is purely combinational with well-defined input-to-output propagation.

6. The outputs are updated immediately upon changes to inputs 'a' or 'b', ensuring that the module responds instantaneously to input changes.
