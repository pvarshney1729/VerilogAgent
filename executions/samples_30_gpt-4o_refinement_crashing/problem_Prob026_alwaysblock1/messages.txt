        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - input wire a; // Single-bit input, representing the first operand of the AND gate.\n  - input wire b; // Single-bit input, representing the second operand of the AND gate.\n\n- Output Ports:\n  - output wire out_assign; // Single-bit output, result of the AND operation using an assign statement.\n  - output wire out_alwaysblock; // Single-bit output, result of the AND operation using a combinational always block.\n\nBehavioral Description:\n1. The module implements an AND gate functionality using two different methods:\n   - An 'assign' statement to directly compute the AND operation between inputs 'a' and 'b' and assign the result to 'out_assign'.\n   - A combinational 'always' block, sensitive to changes in inputs 'a' and 'b', to compute the AND operation and assign the result to 'out_alwaysblock'.\n\n2. The outputs must reflect the logical AND of inputs 'a' and 'b', with the following truth table:\n   - If a = 0 and b = 0, then out_assign = 0 and out_alwaysblock = 0.\n   - If a = 0 and b = 1, then out_assign = 0 and out_alwaysblock = 0.\n   - If a = 1 and b = 0, then out_assign = 0 and out_alwaysblock = 0.\n   - If a = 1 and b = 1, then out_assign = 1 and out_alwaysblock = 1.\n\n3. The module does not contain any sequential logic or require clock or reset signals, as it purely implements combinational logic.\n\n4. The bit width for all signals is 1-bit, and they are unsigned. Bit indexing is not applicable as there are no multi-bit vectors.\n\n5. There are no race conditions, as the logic is purely combinational with well-defined input-to-output propagation.\n\n6. The outputs are updated immediately upon changes to inputs 'a' or 'b', ensuring that the module responds instantaneously to input changes.\n                    "
