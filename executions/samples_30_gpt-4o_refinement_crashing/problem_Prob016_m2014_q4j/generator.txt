<REASONING>
To implement the 4-bit adder using full adders, we will decompose the task into smaller submodules, each representing a full adder. Each full adder will take two input bits and a carry-in, and produce a sum bit and a carry-out. The carry-out from each full adder will be used as the carry-in for the next higher bit position.

1. **Module Definition**: We will define the `TopModule` with inputs `x` and `y` (both 4 bits) and output `sum` (5 bits).

2. **Full Adder Implementation**: We will implement a full adder as a separate module. This module will take two input bits and a carry-in, and produce a sum bit and a carry-out.

3. **Connecting Full Adders**: We will instantiate four full adders in the `TopModule`, connecting them in series. The carry-out from each full adder will be connected to the carry-in of the next full adder.

4. **Output Assignment**: The output `sum` will be constructed from the sum bits of each full adder and the final carry-out.

5. **Combinational Logic**: Since this is purely combinational logic, we will use continuous assignments and avoid any sequential logic or always blocks.

6. **Coding Conventions**: We will use `logic` for all signals, adhere to the specified interface, and ensure all numeric constants are properly sized.

By following these steps, we will ensure that the module correctly implements a 4-bit adder with overflow detection.
