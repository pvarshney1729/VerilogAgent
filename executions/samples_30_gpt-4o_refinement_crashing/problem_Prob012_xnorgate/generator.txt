<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple XNOR gate using Verilog. The XNOR operation is a basic combinational logic operation that can be directly implemented using an assign statement. Given the guidelines and coding conventions, we will use the `logic` type for all ports and signals, and we will use an assign statement to implement the combinational logic. Since the operation is purely combinational, there is no need for an always block or a clock signal. The module will have two input ports, `a` and `b`, and one output port, `out`. The output will be the result of the XNOR operation on the inputs.

);

    // Implementing the XNOR gate using an assign statement
