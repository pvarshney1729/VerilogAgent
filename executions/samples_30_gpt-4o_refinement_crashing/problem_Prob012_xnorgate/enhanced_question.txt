<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface Specifications:
- Input Ports:
  - `input logic a` : 1-bit input signal.
  - `input logic b` : 1-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output logic out` : 1-bit output signal representing the result of the XNOR operation.

Functional Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic gate, specifically an XNOR gate.
- The XNOR operation is defined as the negation of the XOR operation. It produces a logical high ('1') when both input signals `a` and `b` are equal (i.e., both are '0' or both are '1'), and a logical low ('0') otherwise.
- The truth table for the operation is as follows:

  | a | b | out |
  |---|---|-----|
  | 0 | 0 |  1  |
  | 0 | 1 |  0  |
  | 1 | 0 |  0  |
  | 1 | 1 |  1  |

- The output `out` is continuously updated based on the current values of inputs `a` and `b`.

Additional Notes:
- The module operates purely with combinational logic; there are no clocked elements, resets, or initial conditions required.
- Bit indexing is not applicable as all ports are single-bit.
