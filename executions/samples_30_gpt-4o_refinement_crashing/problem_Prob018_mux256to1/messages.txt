Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Inputs:\n  - `input [255:0] in`: A 256-bit vector where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit and `bit[255]` to the most significant bit.\n  - `input [7:0] sel`: An 8-bit vector used as the selector, where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit and `bit[7]` is the most significant bit.\n\n- Output:\n  - `output out`: A single-bit output representing the selected bit from the input vector.\n\nFunctional Specification:\n- The module implements a 1-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer.\n- The 256 inputs are provided in a single packed 256-bit input vector `in`.\n- The 8-bit selector `sel` determines which of the 256 bits from the input vector will be output.\n  - `sel=8'b00000000` selects `in[0]`.\n  - `sel=8'b00000001` selects `in[1]`.\n  - `sel=8'b00000010` selects `in[2]`, and so on up to `sel=8'b11111111` which selects `in[255]`.\n\nConstraints and Assumptions:\n- The module is purely combinational and does not involve any clocked elements or state retention.\n- The selector `sel` must be within the range [0, 255] for valid operation.\n- No assumptions are made about the initial value of the `in` vector. It should be driven by external logic.\n- The output `out` reflects changes in `in` and `sel` without delay, assuming zero propagation delay for theoretical purposes.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- For `sel` values outside the specified range, the output behavior is undefined.\n\nNote: This specification assumes that the Verilog synthesis and simulation tools handle combinational path delays and glitches naturally, without the need for explicit modeling of such behaviors within this specification.\n                    "
