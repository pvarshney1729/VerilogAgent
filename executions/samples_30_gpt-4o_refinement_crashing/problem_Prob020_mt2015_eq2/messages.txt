Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\n1. Interface Definition:\n   - Input Ports:\n     - `input wire [1:0] A`: A 2-bit wide input, where `A[1]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `A[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n     - `input wire [1:0] B`: A 2-bit wide input, where `B[1]` is the MSB and `B[0]` is the LSB.\n   - Output Ports:\n     - `output wire z`: A 1-bit output.\n\n2. Functional Description:\n   - The output `z` shall be set to logic high ('1') if and only if the binary value represented by input `A` is equal to the binary value represented by input `B`.\n   - Otherwise, the output `z` shall be set to logic low ('0').\n\n3. Operational Details:\n   - This module is purely combinational, meaning there are no clock signals or sequential logic elements involved.\n   - The comparison between `A` and `B` should be executed using bitwise equality checking.\n\n4. Edge Cases:\n   - If all bits are logic low (A = 2'b00 and B = 2'b00), `z` should output '1' since A equals B.\n   - If all bits in `A` and `B` are logic high (A = 2'b11 and B = 2'b11), `z` should also output '1'.\n\n5. Initial Conditions:\n   - As this is a combinational logic circuit, no initial conditions or reset conditions are required for the output `z`.\n\n6. Additional Considerations:\n   - Ensure no race conditions exist as this is a purely combinational implementation without feedback paths.\n   - All operations should consider the entire width of the inputs `A` and `B` for equality checking.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
