<Question>
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  cin
 - output cout
 - output sum

The module should implement a full adder. A full adder adds three bits
(including carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.
</Question>

<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops and inputs to zero in simulation, unless provided the specified initial values in the question.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.
</Coding Conventions>

<REASONING>
The task is to implement a full adder in Verilog. A full adder takes three inputs: two bits to be added and a carry-in bit. It produces a sum and a carry-out bit. The sum is calculated using the XOR operation on the three inputs, and the carry-out is determined by the OR operation on the AND combinations of the input pairs. Since the task involves only combinational logic, we will use continuous assignment statements. We will declare all ports as logic, adhering to the coding conventions provided.
</REASONING>

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input logic a,
    input logic b,
    input logic cin,
    output logic cout,
    output logic sum
);

    // Calculate sum using XOR operation
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;

    // Calculate carry-out using OR and AND operations
    assign cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (cin & a);

endmodule
[DONE]
