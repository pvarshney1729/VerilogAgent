<REASONING>
The implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specification and guidelines. The module has three single-bit inputs: `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`, and a single-bit output `out`. The circuit is purely combinational, so no clock or reset signals are involved.

1. **XNOR Gate**: The first operation is a two-input XNOR gate. The inputs to this gate are `in1` and `in2`. The XNOR operation is performed using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) followed by a bitwise NOT (`~`) to achieve the XNOR functionality. The result is stored in an internal signal `xnor_out`.

2. **XOR Gate**: The output of the XNOR gate (`xnor_out`) is then used as one of the inputs to a two-input XOR gate. The second input to this XOR gate is `in3`. The XOR operation is performed using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`), and the result is assigned to the output `out`.

3. **Signal Declaration**: All ports and internal signals are declared as `logic` as per the coding conventions, which is a more modern and flexible data type in SystemVerilog, compatible with Verilog.

4. **Combinational Logic**: The use of `assign` statements ensures that the logic is purely combinational, adhering to the guidelines provided.

The implementation strictly follows the interface and signal names as specified, ensuring correctness and clarity.
