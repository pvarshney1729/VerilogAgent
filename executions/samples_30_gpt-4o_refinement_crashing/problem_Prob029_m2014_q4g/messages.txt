When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.

        "content": "<REASONING>\nThe implementation of the `TopModule` follows the given specification and guidelines. The module has three single-bit inputs: `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`, and a single-bit output `out`. The circuit is purely combinational, so no clock or reset signals are involved.\n\n1. **XNOR Gate**: The first operation is a two-input XNOR gate. The inputs to this gate are `in1` and `in2`. The XNOR operation is performed using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) followed by a bitwise NOT (`~`) to achieve the XNOR functionality. The result is stored in an internal signal `xnor_out`.\n\n2. **XOR Gate**: The output of the XNOR gate (`xnor_out`) is then used as one of the inputs to a two-input XOR gate. The second input to this XOR gate is `in3`. The XOR operation is performed using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`), and the result is assigned to the output `out`.\n\n3. **Signal Declaration**: All ports and internal signals are declared as `logic` as per the coding conventions, which is a more modern and flexible data type in SystemVerilog, compatible with Verilog.\n\n4. **Combinational Logic**: The use of `assign` statements ensures that the logic is purely combinational, adhering to the guidelines provided.\n\nThe implementation strictly follows the interface and signal names as specified, ensuring correctness and clarity.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CODE>\n[BEGIN]\nmodule TopModule(\n    input  logic in1,\n    input  logic in2,\n    input  logic in3,\n    output logic out\n);\n\n    logic xnor_out;\n\n    // Two-input XNOR gate\n    assign xnor_out = ~(in1 ^ in2);\n\n    // Two-input XOR gate\n    assign out = xnor_out ^ in3;\n\nendmodule\n[DONE]\n</CODE>"
