Module Name: TopModule

Port Definitions:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in1`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire in2`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire in3`: Single-bit input signal.

- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out`: Single-bit output signal.

Circuit Description:
- The module implements a combinational logic circuit.
- A two-input XNOR gate is used, with its inputs connected to `in1` and `in2`.
- The output of the XNOR gate drives the first input of a two-input XOR gate.
- The second input of the XOR gate is connected to `in3`.
- The output of the XOR gate is connected to the `out` port.

Signal and Logic Details:
- The XNOR operation produces a logic high (1) if both inputs (`in1` and `in2`) are the same; otherwise, it outputs a logic low (0).
- The XOR operation produces a logic high (1) if its two inputs are different; otherwise, it outputs a logic low (0).
- The logic level of `out` is directly determined by the result of the XOR operation between the XNOR gate's output and `in3`.

Assumptions:
- All inputs are treated as unsigned and are evaluated on a combinational basis.
- There are no clocked elements or sequential logic involved in this module.
- The module does not utilize any reset functionality, as it is purely combinational.

Boundary and Edge Cases:
- The behavior of the circuit is defined for all possible combinations of the `in1`, `in2`, and `in3` inputs.
- No invalid input conditions exist due to the single-bit nature of each input.

Note: Bit indexing and MSB/LSB conventions are not applicable to single-bit signals.
