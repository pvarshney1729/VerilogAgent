<REASONING>
To implement the module `TopModule` as specified, we need to reverse the bit order of an 8-bit input vector `in` and assign the result to an 8-bit output vector `out`. This is a purely combinational logic task, so we can use an `assign` statement to achieve this. The reversed bit order means that the least significant bit (LSB) of `in` becomes the most significant bit (MSB) of `out`, and vice versa. We will use the concatenation operator `{}` to rearrange the bits accordingly. Since this is a simple combinational logic operation, there is no need for a clock or reset signal, and we will adhere to the coding conventions by using `logic` for port declarations.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  logic [7:0] in,
    output logic [7:0] out
);

    // Reverse the bit order of the input and assign to output
    assign out = {in[0], in[1], in[2], in[3], in[4], in[5], in[6], in[7]};

endmodule
[DONE]
