Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface Description:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `in`: A vector input port of width 8 bits. It follows the convention where `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `in[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: A vector output port of width 8 bits. It follows the convention where `out[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) and `out[7]` is the most significant bit (MSB).\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module performs a bit reversal operation on the 8-bit input vector `in`.\n- The LSB of `in` (i.e., `in[0]`) becomes the MSB of `out` (i.e., `out[7]`), and the MSB of `in` (i.e., `in[7]`) becomes the LSB of `out` (i.e., `out[0]`).\n- The specific mapping is as follows:\n  - `out[7] = in[0]`\n  - `out[6] = in[1]`\n  - `out[5] = in[2]`\n  - `out[4] = in[3]`\n  - `out[3] = in[4]`\n  - `out[2] = in[5]`\n  - `out[1] = in[6]`\n  - `out[0] = in[7]`\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- This is a purely combinational logic module, with no clock or reset signals involved.\n- The module assumes that the input bits are valid and stable for the duration required for the combinational logic to propagate.\n- The output is updated instantaneously with any change in the input, reflecting the reversed bit order immediately.\n                    "
