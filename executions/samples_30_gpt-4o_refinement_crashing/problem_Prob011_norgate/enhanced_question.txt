Module Specification for TopModule:

1. Module Name: TopModule

2. Port Definitions:
   - Input Ports:
     - `input wire a`: 1-bit input signal.
     - `input wire b`: 1-bit input signal.
   - Output Ports:
     - `output wire out`: 1-bit output signal representing the logical NOR operation of inputs `a` and `b`.

3. Functionality:
   - The module performs a NOR operation on the input signals `a` and `b`.
   - The NOR operation is defined as: `out = ~(a | b)`.
   - The output `out` will be `1` if both `a` and `b` are `0`; otherwise, `out` will be `0`.

4. Logic Type:
   - The logic implemented within this module is combinational.

5. Bit Indexing:
   - All signals are single-bit, and thus do not require specific bit indexing.

6. Signal Dependencies:
   - The output `out` solely depends on the current values of inputs `a` and `b`.
   - There are no sequential elements; hence, no clock or reset signals are involved.

7. Edge Cases:
   - The module should handle all possible combinations of input values (`00`, `01`, `10`, `11`) correctly, as defined by the NOR operation.
