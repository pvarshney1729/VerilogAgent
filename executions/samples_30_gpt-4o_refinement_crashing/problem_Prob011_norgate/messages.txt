Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Specification for TopModule:\n\n1. Module Name: TopModule\n\n2. Port Definitions:\n   - Input Ports:\n     - `input wire a`: 1-bit input signal.\n     - `input wire b`: 1-bit input signal.\n   - Output Ports:\n     - `output wire out`: 1-bit output signal representing the logical NOR operation of inputs `a` and `b`.\n\n3. Functionality:\n   - The module performs a NOR operation on the input signals `a` and `b`.\n   - The NOR operation is defined as: `out = ~(a | b)`.\n   - The output `out` will be `1` if both `a` and `b` are `0`; otherwise, `out` will be `0`.\n\n4. Logic Type:\n   - The logic implemented within this module is combinational.\n\n5. Bit Indexing:\n   - All signals are single-bit, and thus do not require specific bit indexing.\n\n6. Signal Dependencies:\n   - The output `out` solely depends on the current values of inputs `a` and `b`.\n   - There are no sequential elements; hence, no clock or reset signals are involved.\n\n7. Edge Cases:\n   - The module should handle all possible combinations of input values (`00`, `01`, `10`, `11`) correctly, as defined by the NOR operation.\n                    "
