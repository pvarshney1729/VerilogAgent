<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple NOR gate using a Verilog module named `TopModule`. The module has two 1-bit inputs, `a` and `b`, and one 1-bit output, `out`. The NOR operation is a combinational logic operation, which means it does not require any clock or reset signals. The output `out` should be the logical NOR of the inputs `a` and `b`, which is equivalent to the negation of the OR operation on `a` and `b`. According to the coding conventions, we should use an `assign` statement for this combinational logic, as it is straightforward and does not require an `always` block. The ports should be declared using `logic` as per the conventions, but since the task specifies using `input` and `output`, we will adhere to that for the port declarations.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input  a,
    input  b,
    output out
);

    // Implementing the NOR gate logic
    assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
