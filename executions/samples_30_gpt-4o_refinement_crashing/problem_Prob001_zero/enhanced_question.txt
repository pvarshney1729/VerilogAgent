<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:

- Output Ports:
  - zero: output logic [0:0] // Single-bit output, always LOW (0)

Behavioral Description:
- The output 'zero' should always be driven to a logic LOW (0).
- This is a combinational logic output with no dependencies on any inputs or clock signals.

Additional Notes:
- As there are no input ports or internal states, the module is purely combinational and stateless.
- No reset conditions or clock signals are applicable to this module.
- The output 'zero' remains constant at logic level '0' across all operational conditions.
