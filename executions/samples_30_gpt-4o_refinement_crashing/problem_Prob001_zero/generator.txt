<REASONING>
The task is to create a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single output port `zero` that always outputs a LOW signal. Since the output is constant and does not depend on any inputs or clock signals, we can use a simple continuous assignment to achieve this. There is no need for any internal logic, state machines, or sequential logic, as the output is purely combinational and static.

Given the guidelines and coding conventions, we will:
- Declare the output port using `logic` as per the conventions.
- Use an `assign` statement to set the output `zero` to a constant LOW (`1'b0`).
- Ensure that the module adheres strictly to the provided interface and signal names.

Since there are no inputs or clock signals, and no synchronous reset is required, the implementation is straightforward.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic zero
);

    // Assign the output 'zero' to a constant LOW
    assign zero = 1'b0;

endmodule
[DONE]
