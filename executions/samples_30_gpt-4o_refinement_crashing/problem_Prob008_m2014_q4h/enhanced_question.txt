Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in` : A 1-bit wide input signal.
- Output Ports:
  - `output wire out` : A 1-bit wide output signal.

Functional Description:
- The module `TopModule` is designed to perform a simple combinational logic operation where the output `out` is directly assigned the value of the input `in`.
- This operation is combinational, meaning the output `out` will reflect changes in the input `in` without any delay associated with clock cycles.

Details and Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: As both `in` and `out` are single-bit signals, bit indexing does not apply.
- There are no clock signals, resets, or sequential elements in this module, as it performs purely combinational logic.
- There are no initial values required for any signals, as there are no state-holding elements.
- No edge cases or boundary conditions are applicable beyond the single-bit input/output handling.

Expected Behavior:
- The output `out` is continuously driven to be equal to the input `in` at all times.
