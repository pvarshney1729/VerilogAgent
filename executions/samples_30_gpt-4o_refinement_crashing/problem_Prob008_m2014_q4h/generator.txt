<REASONING>
The task is to implement a simple combinational logic module named `TopModule` with a single input and output, both of which are 1-bit wide. The output should be directly assigned the value of the input. Since this is a straightforward combinational assignment, we use a continuous assignment statement with the `assign` keyword. There is no need for any clock or reset signals, as the operation is purely combinational. The guidelines and coding conventions provided do not apply to this specific task, as they are more relevant to sequential logic design.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    input wire in,
    output wire out
);

    assign out = in;

endmodule
