<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that computes an even parity bit for an 8-bit input. The parity bit is the XOR of all bits in the input, ensuring that the total number of 1s in the 9-bit sequence (including the parity bit) is even.

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` with an 8-bit input `in` and a 1-bit output `parity`.
2. **Port Declaration**: The input `in` is declared as an 8-bit wide vector, and the output `parity` is a single bit.
3. **Parity Calculation**: The parity bit is calculated using a reduction XOR operation (`^in`), which XORs all bits of the vector `in`. This is a concise way to compute the parity bit.
4. **Assign Statement**: The result of the XOR operation is assigned to the output `parity` using an `assign` statement, which is suitable for combinational logic.

The implementation adheres to the coding conventions by using `logic` for port declarations and using an `assign` statement for combinational logic. The reduction XOR operator efficiently computes the parity without needing an `always` block.
