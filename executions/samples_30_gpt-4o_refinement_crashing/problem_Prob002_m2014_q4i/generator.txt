<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` with a single output port `out` that is always driven to logic low ('0'). Based on the guidelines and coding conventions provided, the implementation should use an `assign` statement for this constant output, as there are no inputs or conditions to evaluate. This is a simple combinational logic task, so no `always` block is necessary. The output is a single bit, and we will use a sized constant to ensure proper syntax. There are no flip-flops or synchronous reset requirements in this task.

<CODE>
[BEGIN]
module TopModule(
    output logic out
);
    // Assign a constant logic low to the output
    assign out = 1'b0;
endmodule
[DONE]
</CODE>
