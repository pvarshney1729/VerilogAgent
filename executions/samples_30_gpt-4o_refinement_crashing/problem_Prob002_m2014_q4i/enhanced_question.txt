<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Output: 
  - out (1-bit, output, driven to logic low '0')

Functional Specification:
- The module TopModule is a purely combinational logic circuit.
- The output port 'out' is always driven to a constant logic level of '0' (logic low).
- There are no input ports and no internal states or sequential elements.

Design Considerations:
- Ensure that the output 'out' is continuously driven to '0', without any glitches or unintended states.
- There are no dependencies or conditions affecting the output; it remains static regardless of any internal or external signals.

Implementation Notes:
- The module does not require a clock or reset signal as it contains no sequential logic.
- Since 'out' is a constant signal, no initialization sequence is necessary.

Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:
- Not applicable, as the module's behavior is constant and independent of any external inputs or conditions.
