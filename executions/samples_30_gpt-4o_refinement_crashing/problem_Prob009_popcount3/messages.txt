Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `input [2:0] in`: A 3-bit unsigned vector where `in[2]` is the most significant bit (MSB) and `in[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB).\n  \n- Output Ports:\n  - `output [1:0] out`: A 2-bit unsigned vector representing the population count of '1's in the input vector.\n\nFunctional Description:\n- The module implements a population count circuit, which calculates the number of '1' bits in the input vector `in`.\n- The output `out` represents the count as a 2-bit binary number, ranging from 0 to 3.\n\nDesign Considerations:\n- The logic is combinational, meaning the output `out` is directly dependent on the input `in` and updates without the need for any clock signal.\n- Ensure that the implementation does not introduce any timing or race condition issues, as the module does not involve clocked elements.\n\nEdge Case Handling:\n- Since the input is a 3-bit vector, all possible input combinations (from `000` to `111`) must be handled, with `out` accurately reflecting the number of '1's in each case.\n\nReset and Initialization:\n- This module does not include any sequential elements or state, hence reset conditions and initial values are not applicable.\n\nNote on Bit Indexing:\n- Bit indexing follows a zero-based convention, with `in[0]` being the LSB and `in[2]` being the MSB for the input vector.\n                    "
