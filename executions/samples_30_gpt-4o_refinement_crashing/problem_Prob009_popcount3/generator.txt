<REASONING>
The task is to implement a Verilog module named `TopModule` that performs a population count on a 3-bit input vector `in` and outputs the count as a 2-bit vector `out`. The population count is the number of '1's present in the input vector. 

1. **Interface Definition**: The module has a 3-bit input `in` and a 2-bit output `out`. This is specified in the module's port list.

2. **Combinational Logic**: Since the task is purely combinational (no clock or reset signals are involved), the population count can be implemented using a simple arithmetic operation. The number of '1's in the input vector can be calculated by summing the individual bits of the vector.

3. **Assign Statement**: The `assign` statement is used to implement the combinational logic. It directly computes the sum of the bits in `in` and assigns the result to `out`.

4. **Coding Conventions**: The code adheres to the specified coding conventions:
   - Ports are declared as `logic`.
   - The `assign` statement is used for combinational logic, avoiding the use of an `always` block.
   - All numeric constants are properly sized.
   - The module strictly follows the provided interface and signal names.

5. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The implementation is straightforward and efficient, using minimal logic to achieve the desired functionality.
