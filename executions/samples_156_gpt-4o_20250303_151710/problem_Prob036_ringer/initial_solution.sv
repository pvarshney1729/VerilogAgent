// Enhanced Specification for TopModule

// Module Interface
module TopModule (
    input logic ring,          // Incoming call signal (1 bit, unsigned)
    input logic vibrate_mode,  // Vibrate mode control (1 bit, unsigned)
    output logic ringer,       // Ringer control signal (1 bit, unsigned)
    output logic motor         // Motor control signal (1 bit, unsigned)
);

// Functional Description
// The TopModule is a combinational logic circuit designed to control a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor based on the input signals. The behavior is as follows:
// 1. If `ring` is high (1) and `vibrate_mode` is low (0), then `ringer` should be high (1) and `motor` should be low (0).
// 2. If `ring` is high (1) and `vibrate_mode` is high (1), then `motor` should be high (1) and `ringer` should be low (0).
// 3. If `ring` is low (0), both `ringer` and `motor` should be low (0), regardless of the state of `vibrate_mode`.

assign ringer = ring & ~vibrate_mode; // Ringer is active if ring is high and vibrate_mode is low
assign motor = ring & vibrate_mode;   // Motor is active if both ring and vibrate_mode are high

// Timing and Reset Behavior
// - The module operates purely as combinational logic with no internal state or memory elements.
// - There is no reset behavior required, as the outputs depend solely on current inputs.

// Additional Notes
// - The design assumes that inputs are stable and that changes to inputs do not occur simultaneously with any edge-sensitive behavior, as this is purely combinational.
// - The outputs `ringer` and `motor` are mutually exclusive when `ring` is high, ensuring only one output is active at any time.
