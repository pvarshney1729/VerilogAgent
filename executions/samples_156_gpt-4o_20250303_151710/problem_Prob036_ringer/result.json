The behavior is as follows:\n// 1. If `ring` is high (1) and `vibrate_mode` is low (0), then `ringer` should be high (1) and `motor` should be low (0).\n// 2. If `ring` is high (1) and `vibrate_mode` is high (1), then `motor` should be high (1) and `ringer` should be low (0).\n// 3. If `ring` is low (0), both `ringer` and `motor` should be low (0), regardless of the state of `vibrate_mode`.\n\nassign ringer = ring & ~vibrate_mode; // Ringer is active if ring is high and vibrate_mode is low\nassign motor = ring & vibrate_mode;   // Motor is active if both ring and vibrate_mode are high\n\n// Timing and Reset Behavior\n// - The module operates purely as combinational logic with no internal state or memory elements.\n// - There is no reset behavior required, as the outputs depend solely on current inputs.\n\n// Additional Notes\n// - The design assumes that inputs are stable and that changes to inputs do not occur simultaneously with any edge-sensitive behavior, as this is purely combinational.\n// - The outputs `ringer` and `motor` are mutually exclusive when `ring` is high, ensuring only one output is active at any time.\n\nendmodule\n```",
