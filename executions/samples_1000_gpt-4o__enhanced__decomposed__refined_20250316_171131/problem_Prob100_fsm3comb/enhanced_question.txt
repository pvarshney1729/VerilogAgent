Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.
  - `input wire [1:0] state`: Two-bit input representing the current state.

- Output Ports:
  - `output reg [1:0] next_state`: Two-bit output representing the next state.
  - `output reg out`: Single-bit output signal.

State Encoding:
- State A: 2'b00
- State B: 2'b01
- State C: 2'b10
- State D: 2'b11

State Transition Table (Moore State Machine):
- Current State: A
  - Next State if `in = 0`: A
  - Next State if `in = 1`: B
  - Output: 0

- Current State: B
  - Next State if `in = 0`: C
  - Next State if `in = 1`: B
  - Output: 0

- Current State: C
  - Next State if `in = 0`: A
  - Next State if `in = 1`: D
  - Output: 0

- Current State: D
  - Next State if `in = 0`: C
  - Next State if `in = 1`: B
  - Output: 1

Implementation Details:
- The module implements combinational logic for determining `next_state` and `out`.
- The logic should be designed to operate in a single clock cycle without any sequential elements.
- Ensure that all combinational paths are free from hazards and race conditions.
- Assume that transitions between states and outputs are instantaneous as per a Moore state machine definition.
- Explicitly define all state transitions and outputs using the state transition table provided.
- The initial state and any reset behavior are not specified as the module is purely combinational.

Note:
- Bit indexing follows the convention where `bit[0]` refers to the least significant bit (LSB).
- Ensure the implementation adheres strictly to the specified state transitions and outputs for each state.
