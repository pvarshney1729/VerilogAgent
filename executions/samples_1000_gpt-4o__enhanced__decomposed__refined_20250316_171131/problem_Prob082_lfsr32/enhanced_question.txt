Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Inputs:
  - clk: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic operations are triggered on the positive edge of this clock.
  - reset: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal. When asserted, the LFSR output q is set to its initial state.

- Output:
  - q: 32-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR. Bit 0 (q[0]) is the least significant bit (LSB) and bit 31 (q[31]) is the most significant bit (MSB).

Functional Description:
- The module implements a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR).
- The LFSR shifts right, with feedback applied to specific tap positions.
- The taps are located at bit positions 31, 21, 1, and 0. Note that bit positions are zero-indexed.
- During each clock cycle, the next state of the LFSR is computed as follows:
  - The new value of q[31] is calculated as the XOR of the current value of q[0] with the current values of the tapped positions (q[31], q[21], q[1], and q[0]).
  - All other bits shift right, where each bit q[i] takes the value of q[i+1] from the previous state.
- The reset operation is synchronous and takes effect at the next rising edge of clk.
- When reset is asserted, the LFSR is initialized to the state q = 32'h00000001.

Edge Cases and Behavior:
- Ensure that when reset is deasserted, the LFSR operates normally according to the feedback logic.
- The LFSR repeats its sequence every 2^32 - 1 cycles, assuming the correct implementation of the taps and initial value.

Initial Conditions:
- At power-up or after reset is asserted, the LFSR output q is initialized to 32'h00000001.

Timing:
- All operations are synchronized to the rising edge of the clk signal.
- The reset signal is sampled on the rising edge of clk, ensuring synchronous reset behavior.

Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the LFSR logic is designed to avoid race conditions and to guarantee a maximal length sequence.
- Verify that the feedback logic is correctly implemented to maintain the integrity of the LFSR operation.
