Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module, named `TopModule`, should be implemented with the following interface. Define the input and output ports as follows:\n\n- `input wire clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operations.\n- `input wire reset`: Active-high, synchronous reset signal.\n- `input wire in`: Single-bit input signal.\n- `output reg out`: Single-bit output signal.\n\nDesign a Moore state machine with two states, `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`. The initial state after reset must be `STATE_B`. The state transitions and output behavior are described below:\n\n- In `STATE_B` (output `out=1`):\n  - If `in=0`, transition to `STATE_A`.\n  - If `in=1`, stay in `STATE_B`.\n\n- In `STATE_A` (output `out=0`):\n  - If `in=0`, transition to `STATE_B`.\n  - If `in=1`, stay in `STATE_A`.\n\nAdditional specifications:\n- The reset signal is synchronous with the clock, meaning it affects the state on the rising edge of `clk`.\n- The Most Significant Bit (MSB) convention is not required as all signals are single-bit.\n- Ensure that `out` is updated based on the current state on every rising edge of `clk`.\n- No race conditions are present as the state is solely determined by the current state and input `in`.\n- Edge cases are inherently handled due to the binary nature of `in` and the defined state transitions.\n\nThe intention is to maintain a clear, unambiguous design for the state machine with defined behavior for all possible input conditions.\n                    "
