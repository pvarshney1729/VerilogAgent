Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input, positive edge-triggered.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset input.

- Output Ports:
  - `q`: 5-bit output representing the current state of the LFSR. Bit indexing is from `q[4]` (most significant bit) to `q[0]` (least significant bit).

Functional Description:
1. The module implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). 
2. The LFSR operates by shifting its bits to the right on every positive edge of the clock.
3. Taps are applied at bit positions 4 and 2 (using zero-based indexing).
4. The new value of `q[4]` is determined by XORing `q[0]` (least significant bit) with `q[2]` and `q[4]` (tap positions).
5. The rest of the bits (`q[3:0]`) shift right by one position.

Reset Behavior:
- Upon an active-high synchronous reset, the LFSR output (`q`) will be initialized to the binary value `00001`.

Sequential Logic:
- All changes to the LFSR occur on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning the initialization of `q` to `00001` occurs on the next rising edge of `clk` when `reset` is high.

Edge Cases:
- The LFSR is designed to cycle through all possible non-zero states (31 states for a 5-bit LFSR) before repeating.
- The all-zero state is not considered within the operational sequence of the LFSR.

Note on Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- Bit `q[0]` is the least significant bit of the output.
- Bit `q[4]` is the most significant bit and determines the next state based on the LFSR feedback logic.

Operational Constraints:
- Ensure that no race conditions occur by maintaining the specified clock and reset conditions.
- The initial state after reset ensures that the LFSR never enters the all-zero state, hence maintaining maximum-length cycling.

This specification ensures a clear understanding of the LFSR's functional intent, reset behavior, and operational constraints for correct implementation in Verilog.
