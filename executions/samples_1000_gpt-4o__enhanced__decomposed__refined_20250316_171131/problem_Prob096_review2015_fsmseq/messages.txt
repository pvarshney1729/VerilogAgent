        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- input wire clk: Clock signal, triggering on the positive edge.\n- input wire reset: Synchronous active-high reset signal.\n- input wire data: Serial input bit stream.\n- output reg start_shifting: Output signal, set to high when the sequence is detected.\n\nDetails:\n1. Finite State Machine (FSM):\n   - The FSM searches for the bit sequence '1101' in the input bit stream 'data'.\n   - States are defined as follows:\n     - IDLE: Awaiting the first '1' of the sequence.\n     - S1: First '1' detected.\n     - S11: Second '1' detected.\n     - S110: Sequence '110' detected.\n     - FOUND: Complete sequence '1101' detected.\n\n2. FSM Operation:\n   - Transition from IDLE to S1 upon receiving a '1'.\n   - Transition from S1 to S11 upon receiving another '1'.\n   - Transition from S11 to S110 upon receiving a '0'.\n   - Transition from S110 to FOUND upon receiving a '1'.\n   - Remain in FOUND state indefinitely once the complete sequence is detected.\n\n3. Output Behavior:\n   - When the FSM enters the FOUND state, set 'start_shifting' to 1.\n   - 'start_shifting' remains 1 until the reset is activated.\n\n4. Reset Behavior:\n   - The reset is synchronous and active-high.\n   - Upon reset, the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is set to 0.\n\n5. Initial State:\n   - On system power-up, assume reset has been applied, so the FSM starts in the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is initially 0.\n\n6. Signal Conventions:\n   - Bit indexing is not applicable as all inputs and outputs are single bits.\n   - No additional edge-case handling is necessary beyond the defined resetting behavior.\n\nEnsure that all state transitions and output assignments are handled within the positive edge-triggered always block, respecting the synchronous reset condition.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
