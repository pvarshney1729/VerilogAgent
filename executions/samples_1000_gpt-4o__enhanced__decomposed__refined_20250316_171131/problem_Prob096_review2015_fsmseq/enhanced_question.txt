Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- input wire clk: Clock signal, triggering on the positive edge.
- input wire reset: Synchronous active-high reset signal.
- input wire data: Serial input bit stream.
- output reg start_shifting: Output signal, set to high when the sequence is detected.

Details:
1. Finite State Machine (FSM):
   - The FSM searches for the bit sequence '1101' in the input bit stream 'data'.
   - States are defined as follows:
     - IDLE: Awaiting the first '1' of the sequence.
     - S1: First '1' detected.
     - S11: Second '1' detected.
     - S110: Sequence '110' detected.
     - FOUND: Complete sequence '1101' detected.

2. FSM Operation:
   - Transition from IDLE to S1 upon receiving a '1'.
   - Transition from S1 to S11 upon receiving another '1'.
   - Transition from S11 to S110 upon receiving a '0'.
   - Transition from S110 to FOUND upon receiving a '1'.
   - Remain in FOUND state indefinitely once the complete sequence is detected.

3. Output Behavior:
   - When the FSM enters the FOUND state, set 'start_shifting' to 1.
   - 'start_shifting' remains 1 until the reset is activated.

4. Reset Behavior:
   - The reset is synchronous and active-high.
   - Upon reset, the FSM returns to the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is set to 0.

5. Initial State:
   - On system power-up, assume reset has been applied, so the FSM starts in the IDLE state, and 'start_shifting' is initially 0.

6. Signal Conventions:
   - Bit indexing is not applicable as all inputs and outputs are single bits.
   - No additional edge-case handling is necessary beyond the defined resetting behavior.

Ensure that all state transitions and output assignments are handled within the positive edge-triggered always block, respecting the synchronous reset condition.
