Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input: 
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock signal. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge.
  - `reset`: 1-bit active-high synchronous reset signal.
- Output:
  - `shift_ena`: 1-bit control signal for enabling the shift register.

Functional Description:
- The TopModule is designed to interface with a shift register. It controls the enable signal (`shift_ena`) for the shift register based on the state of an internal Finite State Machine (FSM).
- Upon detecting a predetermined bit pattern (details of the pattern detection are beyond the scope of this specification), the FSM will enable `shift_ena` for exactly 4 consecutive clock cycles.
- Following a reset event (active high), the FSM will immediately assert `shift_ena` for 4 clock cycles, after which `shift_ena` will remain de-asserted (0) indefinitely until another reset occurs.
- The reset is synchronous, meaning it only affects the FSM state and `shift_ena` on the rising edge of `clk`.

Signal and Logic Details:
- `shift_ena` must be initialized to 0 upon reset completion.
- The module's behavior is fully defined by synchronous logic; no asynchronous logic is employed.
- Edge cases include:
  - If reset is applied during the assertion of `shift_ena`, the output immediately transitions to the reset behavior, asserting for 4 cycles post-reset.
  - Ensure that no glitches occur on the `shift_ena` output during state transitions.

Initial Conditions:
- On power-up, assume an implicit reset condition, ensuring `shift_ena` is 0 until a reset is explicitly applied and released, allowing the FSM to start in a known state.

Bit Indexing:
- All specified signals are single bit; no multi-bit indexing is required. Any future extensions involving multi-bit signals should follow the convention where `bit[0]` is the least significant bit.

Note: The specific bit pattern detection mechanism is not detailed in this specification and should be defined based on system-level requirements.
