        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    The module \"TopModule\" is designed to implement the combinational logic portion of a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states, using one-hot encoding. The interface and functionality are defined as follows:\n\n- **Inputs:**\n  - `input wire in;`  \n    - A single-bit input signal that influences the state transitions.\n  - `input wire [3:0] state;`\n    - A 4-bit input representing the current state of the state machine using one-hot encoding.\n    - The state encoding is as follows:\n      - State A: `4'b0001`\n      - State B: `4'b0010`\n      - State C: `4'b0100`\n      - State D: `4'b1000`\n    - Note: Each bit in this vector corresponds to a unique state, with only one bit set to '1' at any time.\n\n- **Outputs:**\n  - `output reg [3:0] next_state;`\n    - A 4-bit output representing the next state of the state machine, also using one-hot encoding.\n  - `output reg out;`\n    - A single-bit output that provides the Moore state machine's output based on the current state.\n\n- **Combinational Logic:**\n  - The state transition and output logic are defined by the following state transition table:\n    - **State A**:\n      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = A (4'b0001)`;\n      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = B (4'b0010)`;\n      - `out = 0`.\n    - **State B**:\n      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = C (4'b0100)`;\n      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = B (4'b0010)`;\n      - `out = 0`.\n    - **State C**:\n      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = A (4'b0001)`;\n      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = D (4'b1000)`;\n      - `out = 0`.\n    - **State D**:\n      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = C (4'b0100)`;\n      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = B (4'b0010)`;\n      - `out = 1`.\n\n- **Additional Notes:**\n  - Ensure that the bit indexing is consistent with the one-hot encoding scheme provided, where `state[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) corresponding to State A.\n  - The module does not include sequential logic, resets, or clock definitions, focusing solely on the combinational logic for state transitions and output generation.\n                    "

When implementing a\n   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the\n   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.\n</Coding Conventions>\n\n<REASONING>\nYour reasoning behind your implementation here.
