<ENHANCED_SPEC>
The module "TopModule" is designed to implement the combinational logic portion of a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states, using one-hot encoding. The interface and functionality are defined as follows:

- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire in;`  
    - A single-bit input signal that influences the state transitions.
  - `input wire [3:0] state;`
    - A 4-bit input representing the current state of the state machine using one-hot encoding.
    - The state encoding is as follows:
      - State A: `4'b0001`
      - State B: `4'b0010`
      - State C: `4'b0100`
      - State D: `4'b1000`
    - Note: Each bit in this vector corresponds to a unique state, with only one bit set to '1' at any time.

- **Outputs:**
  - `output reg [3:0] next_state;`
    - A 4-bit output representing the next state of the state machine, also using one-hot encoding.
  - `output reg out;`
    - A single-bit output that provides the Moore state machine's output based on the current state.

- **Combinational Logic:**
  - The state transition and output logic are defined by the following state transition table:
    - **State A**:
      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = A (4'b0001)`;
      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = B (4'b0010)`;
      - `out = 0`.
    - **State B**:
      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = C (4'b0100)`;
      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = B (4'b0010)`;
      - `out = 0`.
    - **State C**:
      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = A (4'b0001)`;
      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = D (4'b1000)`;
      - `out = 0`.
    - **State D**:
      - If `in = 0`, `next_state = C (4'b0100)`;
      - If `in = 1`, `next_state = B (4'b0010)`;
      - `out = 1`.

- **Additional Notes:**
  - Ensure that the bit indexing is consistent with the one-hot encoding scheme provided, where `state[0]` is the least significant bit (LSB) corresponding to State A.
  - The module does not include sequential logic, resets, or clock definitions, focusing solely on the combinational logic for state transitions and output generation.
