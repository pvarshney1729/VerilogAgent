<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- **Inputs:**
  - `input wire clk` : Clock signal for sequencing.
  - `input wire areset` : Asynchronous reset signal, active high.
  - `input wire in` : Input signal to the state machine.
  
- **Outputs:**
  - `output reg out` : Output signal based on the current state.

Specifications:
- **State Machine Type:** Moore machine.
- **States and Transitions:**
  - **State B**: Output `out` is 1.
    - Transition to State A on `in == 0`.
    - Remain in State B on `in == 1`.
  - **State A**: Output `out` is 0.
    - Transition to State B on `in == 0`.
    - Remain in State A on `in == 1`.
  
- **Reset Behavior:**
  - Asynchronous reset (`areset`) will immediately set the state to State B regardless of the clock.
  - The reset is active high, meaning the state transitions to B when `areset` is 1.
  
- **Initial Conditions:**
  - On power-up or reset event, the initial state is State B.
  
- **Clock and Timing:**
  - State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
  
- **Signal Conventions:**
  - All signals are 1-bit wide.
  - Bit[0] refers to the least significant bit if applicable.
  
- **Race Conditions:**
  - Ensure that the `areset` signal is appropriately synchronized to avoid indeterminate states on reset.
  
- **Edge Cases and Boundaries:**
  - All transitions must be clearly defined for both `in = 0` and `in = 1` scenarios.
  - The module must handle any spurious spikes on the `clk` and `areset` inputs to prevent unintended state transitions.
