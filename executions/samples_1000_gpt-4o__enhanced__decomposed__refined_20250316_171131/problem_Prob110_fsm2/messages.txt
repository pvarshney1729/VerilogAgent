        "content": "To implement your requested module, I have rewritten the specification to be more clear and concise. Here is the enhanced specification:\n                    Module Name: TopModule\n\nInterface:\n- Input Ports:\n  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input signal for sequential logic.\n  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous active-high reset signal. When `areset` is high, the state machine resets to state OFF.\n  - `j`: 1-bit input signal used for state transitions from state OFF.\n  - `k`: 1-bit input signal used for state transitions from state ON.\n- Output Ports:\n  - `out`: 1-bit output signal representing the current state output.\n\nState Machine Description:\n- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.\n- State Encoding:\n  - State OFF: Binary value 0, `out` = 0\n  - State ON: Binary value 1, `out` = 1\n- Initial State: Upon an active-high asynchronous reset (`areset` = 1), the state machine transitions to the OFF state.\n\nState Transitions:\n- From State OFF (`out` = 0):\n  - If `j` = 0, remain in OFF.\n  - If `j` = 1, transition to ON.\n- From State ON (`out` = 1):\n  - If `k` = 0, remain in ON.\n  - If `k` = 1, transition to OFF.\n\nSignal Conventions:\n- Bit Indexing: All signals are single-bit; no specific bit indexing applies.\n- Reset Behavior: The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous. When `areset` is asserted (high), the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state regardless of the clock signal.\n- Output Behavior: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and remains constant throughout a clock cycle.\n\nEdge Cases and Boundaries:\n- The behavior of the state machine is well-defined for all possible input combinations of `j` and `k` while in each state.\n- The asynchronous reset (`areset`) takes precedence over any other inputs and state transitions.\n                    "
