Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `clk`: 1-bit clock input signal for sequential logic.
  - `areset`: 1-bit asynchronous active-high reset signal. When `areset` is high, the state machine resets to state OFF.
  - `j`: 1-bit input signal used for state transitions from state OFF.
  - `k`: 1-bit input signal used for state transitions from state ON.
- Output Ports:
  - `out`: 1-bit output signal representing the current state output.

State Machine Description:
- The module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- State Encoding:
  - State OFF: Binary value 0, `out` = 0
  - State ON: Binary value 1, `out` = 1
- Initial State: Upon an active-high asynchronous reset (`areset` = 1), the state machine transitions to the OFF state.

State Transitions:
- From State OFF (`out` = 0):
  - If `j` = 0, remain in OFF.
  - If `j` = 1, transition to ON.
- From State ON (`out` = 1):
  - If `k` = 0, remain in ON.
  - If `k` = 1, transition to OFF.

Signal Conventions:
- Bit Indexing: All signals are single-bit; no specific bit indexing applies.
- Reset Behavior: The reset (`areset`) is asynchronous. When `areset` is asserted (high), the state machine immediately transitions to the OFF state regardless of the clock signal.
- Output Behavior: The output `out` is determined solely by the current state and remains constant throughout a clock cycle.

Edge Cases and Boundaries:
- The behavior of the state machine is well-defined for all possible input combinations of `j` and `k` while in each state.
- The asynchronous reset (`areset`) takes precedence over any other inputs and state transitions.
