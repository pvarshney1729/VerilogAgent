<ENHANCED_SPEC>
Module Name: TopModule

Interface:
- Input Ports:
  - `input clk`: Clock signal for clocking sequential logic elements. Active on the rising edge.
  - `input reset`: Active-high synchronous reset signal. Resets the state machine to the initial state, OFF.
  - `input j`: Input signal for state transition from OFF to ON.
  - `input k`: Input signal for state transition from ON to OFF.
- Output Port:
  - `output out`: Output signal representing the current state's output value.

Port Characteristics:
- All input and output ports are 1-bit wide.
- The reset signal is synchronous and active-high, meaning it is asserted with the clock edge.

State Machine Description:
- This module implements a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.
- State Definitions:
  - State OFF: Output `out` is '0'.
  - State ON: Output `out` is '1'.

State Transition Diagram:
- From State OFF (out=0):
  - If `j=0`, remain in state OFF.
  - If `j=1`, transition to state ON.
- From State ON (out=1):
  - If `k=0`, remain in state ON.
  - If `k=1`, transition to state OFF.

Initial Conditions and Reset Behavior:
- Upon the assertion of the reset signal, the state machine transitions to the OFF state regardless of the values of `j` and `k`. The output `out` will be '0' during and after the reset is applied.
- The reset is synchronous; transitions caused by the reset occur at the clock edge.

Bit Indexing and Conventions:
- All signals are single-bit and thus do not require specific bit indexing.

Edge Cases and Input Boundaries:
- The behavior for synchronous reset has been specified: it resets to state OFF.
- Transitions only occur on the rising clock edge, ensuring no race conditions between `j` and `k` inputs.
