<Full message><Question>
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (3 bits)
 - output out (2 bits)

The module should implement a "population count" circuit that counts the
number of '1's in the input vector.
</Question>



The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in     (8 bits)
 - output parity

Parity checking is often used as a simple method of detecting errors when
transmitting data through an imperfect channel. The module should compute
a parity bit for an 8-bit byte (which will add a 9th bit to the byte). We
will use "even" parity, where the parity bit is just the XOR of all 8
data bits.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following

specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output out

The module should implement a 2-input AND gate.
</Question>



The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

One common place to see a replication operator is when sign-extending a
smaller number to a larger one, while preserving its signed value. This
is done by replicating the sign bit (the most significant bit) of the
smaller number to the left. For example, sign-extending 4'b0101 (5) to 8
bits results in 8'b00000101 (5), while sign-extending 4'b1101 (-3) to 8
bits results in 8'b11111101 (-3). Implement a module that sign-extends an
8-bit number to 32 bits. This requires a concatenation of 24 copies of
the sign bit (i.e., replicate bit[7] 24 times) followed by the 8-bit
number itself.

- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  ring
 - input  vibrate_mode
 - output ringer
 - output motor

The module should implement a circuit to control a cellphone's ringer and
vibration motor. Whenever the phone needs to ring from an incoming call
(input ring), your circuit must either turn on the ringer (output ringer
= 1) or the motor (output motor = 1), but not both. If the phone is in
vibrate mode (input vibrate_mode = 1), turn on the motor. Otherwise, turn
on the ringer.

`out`, so you do not necessarily need to declare a third wire here.
Notice how wires are driven by exactly one source (output of a gate), but
can feed multiple inputs.

The circuit is composed of two layers. The first layer, counting from the
input, is two AND gates: one whose input is connected to a and b, and the
second is connected to c and d. The second layer there is an OR gate to
OR the two AND outputs, connected the output 'out'. Additionally, there
is an inverted output 'out_n'.

 - output out_assign
 - output out_always_comb
 - output out_always_ff

The module should implement an XOR gate three ways, using an assign
statement (output out_assign), a combinational always block (output
out_always_comb), and a clocked always block (output out_always_ff). Note
that the clocked always block produces a different circuit from the other
two: There is a flip- flop so the output is delayed. Assume all
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

 - input  reset
 - input  in    (32 bits)

The module should examine each bit in the 32-bit input vector, and
capture when the input signal changes from 1 in one clock cycle to 0 the
next. "Capture" means that the output will remain 1 until the register is
reset (active high synchronous reset). Assume all sequential logic is

The module should implement a finite state machine with the following

AND, and a OR gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of
a D flip-flop and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input
NOR gate, whose output is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding
flip-flop's output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding
flip-flop's complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR
is its corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.

Assume that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the
machine begins. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive

one-hot state encoding: A=4'b0001, B=4'b0010, C=4'b0100, D=4'b1000.
Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming
a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output
logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine.

  State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
  A     | A, B                             | 0
  B     | C, B                             | 0

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

the output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as
intermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of
one of the AND gates.

In this circuit, p1y should be the OR of two 3-input AND gates: one that
ANDs p1a, p1b, and p1c, and the second that ANDs p1d, p1e, and p1f. The

For the following Karnaugh map, give the circuit implementation using one
4-to-1 multiplexer and as many 2-to-1 multiplexers as required, but using
as few as possible. You are not allowed to use any other logic gate and
you must use _a_ and _b_ as the multiplexer selector inputs, as shown on
the 4-to-1 multiplexer below.

      ab
  cd  00  01  11  10

  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Consider a block diagram with inputs 'c' and 'd' going into a module
called "TopModule". This "TopModule" has four outputs, mux_in[3:0], that
connect to a four input mux. The mux takes as input {a,b} and ab = 00 is
connected to mux_in[0], ab=01 is connected to mux_in[1], and so in. You

<Full message><Question>
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  load
 - input  ena  (  2 bits)
 - input  data (100 bits)
 - output q    (100 bits)

The module should implement a 100-bit left/right rotator, with
synchronous load and left/right enable. A rotator shifts-in the
shifted-out bit from the other end of the register, unlike a shifter that
discards the shifted-out bit and shifts in a zero. If enabled, a rotator
rotates the bits around and does not modify/discard them.

  (1) load: Loads shift register with data[99:0] instead of rotating.
      Synchronous active high.

  (2) ena[1:0]: Synchronous. Chooses whether and which direction to
      rotate:
      (a) 2'b01 rotates right by one bit,
      (b) 2'b10 rotates left by one bit,
      (c) 2'b00 and 2'b11 do not rotate.

  (3) q: The contents of the rotator.

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk,
 - input  load,
 - input  data (10 bits)
 - output tc

The module should implement a timer that counts down for a given number
of clock cycles, then asserts a signal to indicate that the given
duration has elapsed. A good way to implement this is with a down-counter
that asserts an output signal when the count becomes 0. At each clock
cycle:

  (1) If load = 1, load the internal counter with the 10-bit data, the
  number of clock cycles the timer should count before timing out. The
  counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting
  and has not yet reached 0.

  (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output
  signal tc ("terminal count") indicates whether the internal counter has
  reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0
  (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.

The module should implement a single D flip-flop. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement that shifts right, where a bit position with
a "tap" is XORed with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value,
while bit positions without a tap shift right unchanged. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit
positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. Reset should be active high synchronous, and
should reset the output q to 32'h1. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (5 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement that shifts right, where a bit position with
a "tap" is XORed with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value,
while bit positions without a tap shift right unchanged.  If the taps positions
are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length
LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is
never reached).

The module should implement a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps
at bit positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset
the LFSR output to 1. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in            (4 bits)
 - output out_both      (4 bits)
 - output out_any       (4 bits)
 - output out_different (4 bits)

You are given a four-bit input vector. We want to know some relationships
between each bit and its neighbour:

  (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether
  both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher
  index) are '1'. For example, out_both[2] should indicate if in[2] and
  in[3] are both 1. Since in[3] has no neighbour to the left, the answer
  is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[3].

  (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any
  of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'.
  For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1.
  Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we
  don't need to know out_any[0].

  (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate
  whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to
  the left. For example, out_different[2] should indicate if in[2] is
  different from in[3]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping
  around, so in[3]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following

Consider the following finite-state machine:

  A (0) --1--> B
  A (0) --0--> A
  B (0) --1--> C
  B (0) --0--> D
  C (0) --1--> E
  C (0) --0--> D

  D (0) --0--> A
  E (1) --1--> E
  E (1) --0--> D
  F (1) --1--> C
  F (1) --0--> D

Assume that a one-hot code is used with the state assignment y[5:0] =
000001(A), 000010(B), 000100(C), 001000(D), 010000(E), 100000(F)

The module should implement the state output logic for this finite-state
machine. The output signal Y1 should be the input of state flip-flop
y[1]. The output signal Y3 should be the input of state flip-flop y[3].
Derive the implementation by inspection assuming the above one-hot
encoding.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  scancode (16 bits)
 - output left
 - output down
 - output right
 - output up

The module should process scancodes from a PS/2 keyboard for a game.
Given the last two bytes of scancodes received, you need to indicate
whether one of the arrow keys on the keyboard have been pressed. This
involves a fairly simple mapping, which can be implemented as a case
statement (or if-elseif) with four cases.

  Scancode[15:0] | Arrow key
  16'he06b       | left arrow
  16'he072       | down arrow
  16'he074       | right arrow
  16'he075       | up arrow
  Anything else  | none

Your circuit has one 16-bit input, and four outputs. Build this circuit
that recognizes these four scancodes and asserts the correct output.

interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  enable
 - input  S
 - input  A
 - input  B
 - input  C
 - output Z

The module should implement a circuit for an 8x1 memory, where writing to
the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random
access", as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a
3-input logic function. First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8
D-type flip-flops. Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The
shift register input should be called S, which feeds the input of Q[0]
(MSB is shifted in first). The enable input is synchronous active high
and controls whether to shift. Extend the circuit to have 3 additional
inputs A,B,C and an output Z. The circuit's behaviour should be as
follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on.
Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and
multiplexers. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive
edge of the clock.

 - input  predict_valid

The module should implement a 32-bit global history shift register,
including support for rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush
caused by a branch misprediction. When a branch prediction is made
(predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update
the branch history for the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the
direction of the youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs
(train_mispredicted = 1), load the branch history register with the
history after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the
history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with
the actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and
misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence,
because the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is
currently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch
history register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset
that resets the history counter to zero. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in            (100 bits)
 - output out_both      (100 bits)
 - output out_any       (100 bits)
 - output out_different (100 bits)

The module takes as input a 100-bit input vector in[99:0] and should
produce the following three outputs:

  (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether
  both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'.
  For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both
  1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so
  simply set out_both[99] to be zero.

  (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any
  of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'.
  For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1.
  Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so
  simply set out_any[0] to be zero.

  (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate
  whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to
  the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is
  different from in[99]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping
  around, so in[99]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise

 - input  clk
 - input  L
 - input  q_in
 - input  r_in
 - output Q

Consider this Verilog module "full_module":

  module full_module (
      input [2:0] r,
      input L,
      input clk,
      output reg [2:0] q);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
      if (L) begin
        q <= r;
      end else begin
        q <= {q[1] ^ q[2], q[0], q[2]};
      end
    end

  endmodule

Note that q[2:0] is three bits wide, representing three flip-flops that can be
loaded from r when L is asserted. You want to factor full_module into a hierarchical
design, flipflop and 2:1 multiplexer are in a submodule "TopModule", and that submodule
will be instantiated three times in full_module code. Create the submodule called "TopModule".
You do not have to provide the revised full_module.

The module should implement Rule 90, a one-dimensional cellular automaton
with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a
one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next
state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:

  Left | Center | Right | Center's next state
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one
time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the
system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1]

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  aresetn
 - input  x
 - output z

The module should implement a Mealy-type finite state machine that
recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named x. Your FSM should
have an output signal, z, that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101"
sequence is detected. Your FSM should also have a negative edge triggered
asynchronous reset. You may only have 3 states in your state machine.
Your FSM should recognize overlapping sequences. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  s
 - input  w
 - output z

The module should implement a finite state machine with inputs s and w.
Assume that the FSM begins in a reset state called A, as depicted below.
The FSM remains in state A as long as s = 0, and it moves to state B when
s = 1. Once in state B the FSM examines the value of the input w in the
next three clock cycles. If w = 1 in exactly two of these clock cycles,
then the FSM has to set an output z to 1 in the following clock cycle.
Otherwise z has to be 0. The FSM continues checking w for the next three
clock cycles, and so on. Use as few states as possible. Note that the s
input is used only in state A, so you need to consider just the w input.
Assume reset is active high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following

specified.

 - input  clk

 - input  ena

The module should implement a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with
synchronous load. The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or
8 bit positions, selected by "amount." Assume the right shit is an
arithmetic right shift.

Signals are defined as below:

  (1) load: Loads shift register with data[63:0] instead of shifting.
       Active high.
  (2) ena: Chooses whether to shift. Active high.
  (3) amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift.
      (a) 2'b00: shift left by 1 bit.
      (b) 2'b01: shift left by 8 bits.
      (c) 2'b10: shift right by 1 bit.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent
along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes
from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8
data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing
is being transmitted (idle).

Implement a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the
start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was
correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait
until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol
sends the least significant bit first.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Create a set of counters suitable for use as a 12-hour clock (with am/pm
indicator). Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse
on ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second, while
"clk" is much faster than once per second). The signal "pm" is asserted
if the clock is PM, or is otherwise AM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD
(Binary- Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59),
and seconds (00-59). Reset is the active high synchronous signal that
resets the clock to "12:00 AM." Reset has higher priority than enable and
can occur even when not enabled. Assume all sequential logic is triggered
on the positive edge of the clock.

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a

 - input  clk

 - input  s (3 bits)
 - output fr2
 - output fr1
 - output fr0
 - output dfr

A large reservior of water serves several users. In order to keep the
level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at
5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[2],
the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest
sensor s[0], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve
and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is
between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the
water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water
level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table
below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower
than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the
Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr).

  Water Level           | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted
  Above s[2]            | s[0], s[1], s[2] | None
  Between s[2] and s[1] | s[0], s[1]       | fr0

  Below s[0]            | None             | fr0, fr1, fr2

Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state
machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a
long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in
 - input  reset
 - output out_byte (8 bits)
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent
along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes
from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8
data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing
is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will
identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of
bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then
verify that the stop bit was correct. The module will also output the
correctly-received data byte. `out_byte` needs to be valid when `done` is
1, and is don't-care otherwise. If the stop bit does not appear when
expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting
to receive the next byte. Include a active-high synchronous reset. Note
that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first. It should
assert done each time it finds a stop bit. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise

 - input  load
 - input  data (512 bits)
 - output q    (512 bits)

The module should implement Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular
automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).
There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step,
the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell
depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following
table:

  Left[i+1] | Center[i] | Right[i-1] | Center's next state 
  1         | 1         | 1          | 0
  1         | 1         | 0          | 1
  1         | 0         | 1          | 1
  1         | 0         | 0          | 0
  0         | 1         | 1          | 1

  0         | 0         | 0          | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one
time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input
indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0].
Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512], if they existed) are both zero
(off). Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

 - input  clk

 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - output walk_left

The module should implement a simple game called Lemmings which involves
critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model
it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can
be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right
(walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In
particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on
bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving
a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at
the same time, it will still switch directions.

The module should implement a Moore state machine with two states, two
inputs, and one output (internal to the module) that models this
behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous resetting the
Lemming machine to walk left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on
the positive edge of the clock.

The module should implement a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and
7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index
accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch
predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The
branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions
and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the
processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction
predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches
proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the
branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the
actual branch direction outcomes.

When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc,
the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of
the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch
history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for
the predicted branch.

When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch
predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch
that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether
the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the
pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this
branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being
trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the
state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.

If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different,
younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want
to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes
precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway.
If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time,
the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only
modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing
diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the
same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in
cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at
cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle
4. Reset is asynchronous active-high.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  y (3 bits)

The module should implement the state machine shown below:

  A (0) --0--> B
  A (0) --1--> A
  B (0) --0--> C
  B (0) --1--> D
  C (0) --0--> E
  C (0) --1--> D

  D (0) --1--> A
  E (1) --0--> E
  E (1) --1--> D
  F (1) --0--> C
  F (1) --1--> D

The FSM should be implemented using three flip-flops and state codes
y = 000, 001, ..., 101 for states A, B, ..., F, respectively. Implement
just the next-state logic for y[1]. The output Y1 is y[1].

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.
If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch
directions.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is
asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has
to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to
monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three
successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock
cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y
has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should
maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not
become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0
permanently (until reset). Assume all sequential logic is triggered on
the positive edge of the clock.

The module should implement the following Moore state machine with 3

Unless otherwise stated in the diagram below, assume outputs are 0 and
inputs are don't cares.

  Count (counting=1)  --done_counting=1--> Wait
  Wait  (done=1)      --ack=0--> Wait
  Wait  (done=1)      --ack=1--> S

At reset, the state machine starts in state "S". Derive next-state logic
equations and output logic equations by inspection assuming the following
one-hot encoding is used: (S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, Wait)

Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming
a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output
logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine.

Write code that generates the following signals:

 - B3_next -- Assert when next-state is B3 state
 - S_next -- Assert when next-state is S state
 - S1_next -- Assert when next-state is S1 state
 - Count_next -- Assert when next-state is Count state

The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long.
However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages
start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three
byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be
1 or 0 depending on data).

The module should implement a finite state machine that will search for
message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll
use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume
that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message
once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in
the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was
successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

The module should implement a finite state machine that will search for

that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message

Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte)
message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first
byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is
active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done
signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e.,
don't-care). Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  r (3 bits)
 - output g (3 bits)

The module should implement the FSM described by the state diagram shown
below:

  A        --r0=0,r1=0,r2=0--> A
  A        -------r0=1-------> B
  A        -----r0=0,r1=1----> C
  A        --r0=0,r1=0,r2=0--> D
  B (g0=1) -------r0=1-------> B
  B (g0=1) -------r0=0-------> A
  C (g1=1) -------r1=1-------> C
  C (g1=1) -------r1=0-------> A

Resetn is an active-low synchronous reset that resets into state A. This
FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of
resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for
the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either
_r[0]_, _r[1]_, or _r[2]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and
represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long
as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM
decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to
a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an
output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 0 has a
higher priority than device 1, and device 2 has the lowest priority.
Hence, for example, device 2 will only receive a grant if it is the only
device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_,
is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant
as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.

Implement a module that represents this FSM. Use separate always blocks
for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures.
Describe the FSM outputs, _g[i]_, using either continuous assignment
statement(s) or an always block (at your discretion). Assign any state
codes that you wish to use. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on
the positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise

 - input  in
 - input  state (10 bits)

Given the follow state machine with 1 input and 2 outputs (the outputs
are given as "(out1, out2)"):

  S0 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S0 (0, 0) --1--> S1
  S1 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S1 (0, 0) --1--> S2

  S3 (0, 0) --1--> S4
  S4 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S4 (0, 0) --1--> S5
  S5 (0, 0) --0--> S8
  S5 (0, 0) --1--> S6
  S6 (0, 0) --0--> S9
  S6 (0, 0) --1--> S7
  S7 (0, 1) --0--> S0
  S7 (0, 1) --1--> S7
  S8 (1, 0) --0--> S0
  S8 (1, 0) --1--> S1
  S9 (1, 1) --0--> S0
  S9 (1, 1) --1--> S1

Suppose this state machine uses one-hot encoding, where state[0] through
state[9] correspond to the states S0 though S9, respectively. The outputs
are zero unless otherwise specified. The next_state[0] through next_state[9] 
correspond to the transition to next states S0 though S9. For example, The 
next_state[1] is set to 1 when the next state is S1 , otherwise, it is set to 0.

Here, the input state[9:0] can be a combinational of multiple states, and 
the TopModule is expected to response.
For example: 
When the state[9:0] = 10'b0000010100, state[4] == 1, and state[2] == 1, the 
states includes S4, and S2 states.

The module should implement the state transition logic and output logic
portions of the state machine (but not the state flip-flops). You are
given the current state in state[9:0] and must implement next_state[9:0] 
and the two outputs.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from
accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5
consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need
to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a
Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The
output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the
clock cycle after the condition occurs. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  bump_left
 - input  bump_right
 - input  ground
 - input  dig
 - output walk_left
 - output walk_right
 - output aaah
 - output digging

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple
that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the
Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left
(walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch
directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped
on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's
bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.
If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch
directions.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say ""aaah!"". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable.
If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In
particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits
the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all
4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no
upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.
Lemmings only splatter when hitting the ground; they do not splatter in
mid-air.

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following

specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - input  done_counting
 - input  ack
 - output shift_ena
 - output counting
 - output done

The module should implement a timer that:

  (1) is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,
  (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
  (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and
  (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.

In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls
the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included
here.

The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101
is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for
exactly 4 clock cycles. After that, the state machine asserts its
counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits
until input done_counting is high.At that point, the state machine must
assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until
input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the
start sequence (1101). The state machine should have a active high
synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the
input sequence 1101. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.

 - input  data (256 bits)

The module should implemement a "game" played on a two-dimensional grid
of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time
step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:

  (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.
  (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.
  (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.
  (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.

The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use
a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16
toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For
example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15),
(0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by
a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a
sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc.

  (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial
       state. Active high synchronous.
  (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.

The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped,
when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground
reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same
direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect
the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground
disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while
still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.

In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do
useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig
if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will
continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that
point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue
walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with
falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig
when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a
walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of
these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig,
which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is
positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk
left. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

The following plan/guidelines might be useful for generating the correct Verilog code:
<Guidelines>
- Ensure synchronous reset is implemented as specified.
- Initialize all flip-flops to zero in simulation.
- Adhere strictly to the provided interface and signal names.
- Generate results in the specified cycle timing.
- Infer logic correctly, especially when using Karnaugh maps.
- Handle bitwise operations and signal broadcasting correctly.
</Guidelines>

Here are some additional rules and coding conventions.
<Coding Conventions>
 - Declare all ports and signals as logic; do not to use wire or reg.
 - For combinational logic with an always block do not explicitly specify
   the sensitivity list; instead use always @(*).
 - All sized numeric constants must have a size greater than zero
   (e.g, 0'b0 is not a valid expression).
 - An always block must read at least one signal otherwise it will never
   be executed; use an assign statement instead of an always block in
   situations where there is no need to read any signals.
 - if the module uses a synchronous reset signal, this means the reset
   signal is sampled with respect to the clock. When implementing a
   synchronous reset signal, do not include posedge reset in the
   sensitivity list of any sequential always block.

<Full message><Question>
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output count (4 bits)
 - output counting
 - output done
 - input  ack

The module should implement a timer with one input that:

  (1) is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
  (2) shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
  (3) waits for the counters to finish counting, and
  (4) notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.

The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101
is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits,
most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the
timer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine
asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and
delay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input
until it resumes searching after everything else is done.

The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock
cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count
6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal
to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until
it is 0 for 1000 cycles.

When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care
(whatever value is convenient for you to implement). At that point, the
circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and
waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next
occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the
input sequence 1101. The reset signal is active high synchronous. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
